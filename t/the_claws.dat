5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and <b>the</b> <b>claws</b> non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and <b>the</b> <b>claws</b> become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on <b>the</b> <b>claws</b> might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of <b>the</b> <b>claws</b> and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{a review}} of all well-preserved {{specimens}} including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported: A. lithographica (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and A. siemensii (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in A. lithographica (<b>the</b> <b>claws</b> of A. siemensii specimens being relatively simple and straight). A. lithographica also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, Wellnhoferia grandis (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from A. lithographica except in its larger size.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies slide-resisting forces {{generated}} by <b>claws</b> in <b>the</b> free-walking beetle Pachnoda marginata (Coleoptera, Scarabaeoidea) {{with emphasis on}} the relationship between the dimension of <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> tip and <b>the</b> substrate texture. To evaluate the force range by which <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> can interact with a substrate, forces {{generated by}} the freely moving legs were measured using a load cell force transducer. To obtain information about material properties of <b>the</b> <b>claw,</b> its mechanical strength was tested in a fracture experiment, and the internal structure of <b>the</b> fractured <b>claw</b> material was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The bending stress of <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> was evaluated as 143. 4 - 684. 2 MPa, depending on the cross-section model selected. Data from these different approaches led us to propose a model explaining the saturation of friction force with increased texture roughness. The forces are determined by the relative size of the surface roughness R- a (or an average particle diameter) and the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> tip. When surface roughness is much bigger than <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> tip diameter, <b>the</b> beetle can grasp surface irregularities and generate a high degree of attachment due to mechanical interlocking with substrate texture.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of <b>The</b> <b>Claws</b> of Axos.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the arms and hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, {{even more so than}} that of Ceratosaurus.

50|$|The {{success rate}} of winning a prize is {{dependent}} on several factors including operator settings, player skill, type of machine, and the prizes available (size, density, and distribution). A prize may be lost due to player inexperience, player error in manipulating <b>the</b> <b>claw,</b> <b>the</b> weakness of <b>the</b> <b>claw,</b> or <b>the</b> specific crane configuration. Many modern cranes use a computer to determine an expected payout percentage based on the operator's settings. All modern claw machines incorporate some means for the owner to adjust at least the strength of <b>the</b> <b>claw's</b> grip and how closely <b>the</b> <b>claw's</b> fingers pull together, usually with screws on the mechanism or potentiometers on the PCB. Even on older machines, the grip strength can be adjusted by adding circuit components or additional hardware. Some machines incorporate a feature called two-level claw power, which, when enabled, causes <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> to at first grip at full strength, but then gradually weaken its grip to the normal level after a brief delay. This can cause the crane to initially pick up the prize, but then drop it.|$|R
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of <b>the</b> <b>claws</b> suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs.

For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
5|$|Species of Oryzomys are {{medium-sized}} rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts {{white to}} buff.

5|$|The non-reproductive castes of {{termites}} are wingless {{and rely}} exclusively on their six legs for locomotion.

5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s.

Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E

40|$|The {{suspensory}} {{apparatus of}} the distal phalanx {{in the entire}} circumference of <b>the</b> bovine <b>claw</b> was investigated employing light and electron microscopy as well as histochemical and morphometrical techniques. This profound study was based on 158 adult bovine <b>claws,</b> in total. <b>The</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus suspends the distal phalanx in <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> capsule and consists of a connective tissue and an epidermal compound which adhere by a specialised dermo-epidermal borderline. <b>The</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus connects via a four-zonal insertion area to the parietal surface of the distal phalanx. This four-zonal insertion area represents the connective tissue compound of the suspensory apparatus, which is mainly dermal and consists of a lamellar bone zone, a zone of calcified and uncalcified fibrous cartilage, respectively, and a zone of parallel-orientated dense fibres. The latter consists mainly of type I collagenous fibres, elastic and reticular fibres and is flanked by loosely arranged connective tissue containing numerous cells and blood vessels. The zone of parallel-orientated dense fibres acts as a supporting and anchoring system of the distal phalanx and conducts the tension forces to the epidermal compound of <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus. <b>The</b> zone of loose, well-vascularised connective tissue represents an equally modified part of the dermis and provides nutritional supply for both <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus and the avascular epidermis. Additionally, it enables a close messenger- and growth-factor-mediated dermo-epidermal co-ordination. The tension forces borne by bundles of collagenous fibre originating in different angles {{from the surface of}} the distal phalanx are indirectly transferred to the horny lamellae via the basal membrane, and from there on to the coronary horn of <b>the</b> horny <b>claw</b> capsule. <b>The</b> mechanical load is distributed onto the very large surface of the dermo-epidermal borderline which is enlarged by formation of 1800 to 1200 dermal and epidermal lamellae, respectively, in total. The latter applies to the situation in the hind limb, whereas in the fore limb only an average of 1600 to 1800 lamellae are formed in the distal part of the wall segment. The lamellary, cap and terminal epidermis thus represent the epidermal compound of <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus which stabilises the anchoring via specialised intra- and inter-cellular elements and enables an elastic-resilient transfer of tension forces. Taking all specified modifications of the wall segment into consideration leads to the functional conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus is a highly specialised anchoring system which accomplishes the main part of force transformation in the dorsal and in the apical third of the abaxial parietal area of <b>the</b> <b>claw.</b> <b>The</b> distal phalanx is lowered under load, and the traction caused by <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus in the inner coronary horn thus induces <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>claw</b> mechanism implies <b>the</b> reversible shape alterations of <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> capsule and <b>the</b> structures encased within, caused by loading and unloading of <b>the</b> <b>claw.</b> A proximo-distally increasing, respectively dorso-plantarly decreasing, force gradient is detectable. Additional measurements of the loaded and unloaded <b>claw</b> revealed <b>the</b> natural loading circumstances and the relative load capacity of <b>the</b> <b>claw,</b> resulting in <b>the</b> detection of certain loci minores resistentiae. Regions with fibro-cartilaginous insertions such as the wall and solear segment, and insertion areas of ligaments and tendons, are exposed to multidirectional forces while they are not protected by a subcutaneous cushion. Therefore, these regions deserve major attention in improperly loaded claws. Regions displaying a subcutaneous cushion, like the coronary and bulbar segment, do participate in the load-induced strain but are protected accordingly. The body weight-generated pressure forces are transferred to the distal phalanx via the skeletal system. In the first phase of weight-bearing, the pressure force is transduced into motion by elements of the bulbar and solear segment, while it is transformed into a tension force by <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus in the second phase. The different load capacities and the resulting differing structural and functional modifications in the respective segments of <b>the</b> <b>claw,</b> imply to regard all segments collectively as the weight-bearing apparatus of <b>the</b> <b>claw.</b> <b>The</b> weight-bearing apparatus consists of a shock-absorbing apparatus on the one hand, i. e. the anti-shock pad and pressure buffer of the bulbar segment and the respective elements of the solear segment, and the suspensory apparatus of the distal phalanx on the other hand, i. e. the tension force transforming areas. <b>The</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus in a narrower sense consists of the wall segment and the sustaining elements of the solear segment. For suspension of the distal phalanx, the extensor tendon, the deep flexor tendon and the whole ligamentary apparatus of the ungular joint are equally essential, therefore these form <b>the</b> <b>claw</b> suspensory apparatus in a broader sense. The solear segment comprises both tension transforming as well as pressure absorbing elements and is therefore defined as transfer or transitional region. The suspensory and the shock-absorbing apparatus of the distal phalanx are highly specialised epidermal and dermo-subcutaneous systems, both accomodating the weight-bearing induced strains...|$|R
