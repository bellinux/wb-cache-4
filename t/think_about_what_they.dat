500|$|One {{year after}} the all-star {{recording}} of [...] "What More Can I Give", it was played {{for the first time}} on radio. WKTU-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, [...] "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called [...] "What More Can I Give", and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can give." [...] It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of [...] "What More Can I Give".|$|E
500|$|Development {{for this}} game was {{directed}} and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto (credited as S. Miyahon) and Takashi Tezuka (credited as Ten Ten). Miyamoto produced the game, and Tezuka wrote {{the story and}} script. Keiji Terui, a screenwriter who worked on anime shows such as Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball, wrote the backstory for the manual, drawing inspiration from conflicts in medieval Europe. Development began in 1984, and the game was originally {{intended to be a}} launch title for the Famicom Disk System. The development team worked on The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. concurrently, and tried to separate their ideas: Super Mario Bros. was to be linear, where the action occurred in a strict sequence, whereas The Legend of Zelda would be the opposite. In Mario, Miyamoto downplayed the importance of the high score in favor of simply completing the game. This concept was carried over to The Legend of Zelda. Miyamoto was also in charge of deciding which concepts were [...] "Zelda ideas" [...] or [...] "Mario ideas." [...] Contrasting with Mario, Zelda was made non-linear and forced the players to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should do next. In the initial game designs, the player would start the game with the sword already in their inventory. According to Miyamoto, those in Japan were confused and had trouble finding their way through the multiple path dungeons. Rather than listening to the complaints, Miyamoto took away the sword, forcing players {{to communicate with each other}} and share their ideas to find the various secrets hidden in the game. This was a new form of game communication, and in this way, [...] "Zelda became the inspiration for something very different: Animal Crossing. This was a game based solely on communication." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writers and}} {{producers}} got together {{to discuss what}} direction they would take for the seventh series. They wanted to repeat the same style for series six, which was to add a serial element to be carried throughout {{the duration of the}} series. They got together to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would believe to be a big political story that would affect politics in the United Kingdom in within twelve to eighteen months after their initial meetings early in 2008. They settled on using Russia, which was facing a resurgence in power after the Cold War, which the producers felt, in subtle ways, would threaten the security of the west. Sometime through the writing process, the producers set up a story-arc, Sugarhorse, to be a threat throughout the series and have it resolved by the finale. The writers enjoyed making the Sugarhorse storyline because {{it was one of the}} instances that [...] "really brings Harry to the edge" [...] and causing him to doubt everything he has done or achieved. The writing team took several meetings together to discuss what it is and how it should work into the storyline. Christian Spurrier noted it was [...] "kind of a headache" [...] to figure out how to [...] "weave it in" [...] to the series and work out what parts would be used in which episodes. The producers wanted to use a scene relating to Sugarhorse as the finale scene of every episode it was featured in, as the producers believed it would provide a [...] "right hook" [...] to the audience. Adding the new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the characters should trust.|$|E

5000|$|The {{title of}} the album, No Sound Without Silence, is both a {{shortening}} of philosophical idea put forward by the band and a critical comment on the music industry. No Sound Without Silence is a phrase derived from an idea put forward by the band, where meaningful statements cannot be made without thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{you want to say}} first; the [...] "silence" [...] referring to the silence that persists while a person <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to say, and the [...] "sound" [...] referring to the sounds made by people when they speak. The phrase is also a comment {{on the state of the}} music industry, where, according to the band, most artists and labels do not <b>think</b> critically <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to say, therefore, do not say meaningful things. The Script lead vocalist Danny O'Donoghue commented on the album's title, stating [...] "The time we've been away, we've had time to contemplate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we want to say to the industry. There is no sound without silence. You can't have anything good to say if you don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it first".|$|R

2500|$|The re-shoots {{coupled with}} other overages caused {{the budget to}} balloon to around $190 million, which shocked Paramount {{president}} Marc Evans. Several of the scenes shot in Budapest, including a large-scale battle with the zombies in Moscow's Red Square, were dropped from the final cut in order to water down the film's political undertones, and steer it towards a more generally friendly summer blockbuster. The climactic battle scene in Russia, for which there was [...] of footage, had Pitt's character fighting through zombies more like [...] "a warrior hero" [...] than [...] "the sympathetic family man" [...] of the earlier acts. The second-unit director, Simon Crane, said, [...] "It wasn't character-driven anymore... really needed to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted to do with}} the third act."

50|$|In Blumer's third premise {{the idea}} of minding comes into play. Symbolic interactionists {{describe}} thinking as an inner conversation. (Griffin 62). Mead called this inner dialogue minding. Minding is the delay in one's thought process that happens when one <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will do next. The third premise is that these meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person {{in dealing with the}} things he encounters. We naturally talk to ourselves in order to sort out the meaning of a difficult situation. But first, we need language. Before we can think, we must be able to interact symbolically. (Griffin 62). The emphasis on symbols, negotiated meaning, and social construction of society brought on attention to the roles people play. Role-taking is a key mechanism that permits people to see another person's perspective to understand what an action might mean to another person. Role-taking is a part of our lives at an early age. Playing house and pretending to be someone else are examples of this phenomenon. There is an improvisational quality of roles; however, actors often take on a script that they follow. Because of the uncertainty of roles in social contexts, the burden of role-making is on the person in the situation. In this sense, we are proactive participants in our environment.|$|R

Similarly, Deng and Yuen (2011) who upon surveying student teachers’ experiences with the integration of a weblog during their practicum, found that blogs supported self-expression and self-reflection, as well as social interaction and reflective dialogue.|$|R

2500|$|The Symposium is {{considered}} a dialogue – a form used by Plato in more than thirty works – {{but in fact it}} is predominantly a series of essay-like speeches from differing points of view.
