5|$|An Introduction <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> and Political Theory {{begins by}} {{discussing}} {{the history of}} animals in political theory before considering the approaches taken {{to the status of}} animals by five schools of political theory: utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism. The final chapter outlines Cochrane's own approach, which he situates between liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b> Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> and people.

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts.

The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state}} of constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
