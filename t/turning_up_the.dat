500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Keith Caulfied of Billboard deemed it as a [...] "very dance-by-the-numbers with Madonna" [...] song, and further assessed that the chorus made [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] a memorable song. Robbie Daw from Idolator said that [...] "Madge [...] doing [...] {{what she does}} best: <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heat on the dance floor," [...] but that [...] "the song is packed with tried-but-true sexual pop cliches." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated it three out of five stars. He commended the singer for the electro and Europop composition of the track, describing it as [...] "buoyant and warm-rinse soothing. It's {{the sound of a}} woman who hits the dance-floor for restoration more than craziness." [...] Haigh from Attitude believed that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] should have been released as the lead single from MDNA. He felt that the track [...] "screams" [...] early 1990s Madonna's work, and complimented it for being a [...] "basic, balls-to-the-wall night out anthem", adding [...] "why does that have to be something that's considered 'below' Madonna?" [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the [...] "pop stomper" [...] track, writing: [...] "The production might sound like she's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna, but who's counting. Madonna brings her own authority, creating the kind of anthemic party song that she does best, the kind where everyone from your three-year-old niece to your 60-year-old mother gets up on the dancefloor." [...] MTV News journalist Bradley Stern felt that the composition emulated her single [...] "Celebration" [...] (2009).|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} guitar amplifiers, such as some vintage amps {{and modern}} practice amps, {{have only a}} single volume control. Most have two volume controls: a first volume control called [...] "preamplifier" [...] or [...] "gain" [...] and a master volume control. The preamp or gain control works differently on different guitar amp designs. On an amp designed for acoustic guitar, <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> preamp knob pre-amplifies the signal—but even at its maximum setting, the preamp control is unlikely to produce much overdrive. However, with amps designed for electric guitarists playing blues, hard rock and heavy metal music, <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> preamp or gain knob usually produces overdrive distortion. Some electric guitar amps have three controls in the volume section: pre-amplifier, distortion and master control. <b>Turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> preamp and distortion knobs in varying combinations can create a range of overdrive tones, from a gentle, warm growling overdrive suitable for a traditional blues show or a rockabilly band to the extreme distortion used in hardcore punk and death metal. On some electric guitar amps, the [...] "gain" [...] knob [...] {{is equivalent to the}} distortion control on a distortion pedal, and similarly may have a side-effect of changing the proportion of bass and treble sent to the next stage.|$|E

During PMQs, Labour backbenchers would raise their fingers to their lips and say [...] "shush" [...] when he was speaking.

2500|$|After Metesky's arrest, early police {{statements}} credited {{the finding}} of his file to an NYPD detective. [...] Later, a report developed in a reward investigation conceded that Alice Kelly had found the file, and explained the misplaced credit as due to a misunderstanding of the file being [...] "picked up" [...] by the detective (at the Con Edison offices on Monday morning) as meaning that the file was [...] "picked out" [...] (of many). Although the NYPD did officially credit Kelly with <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> clue that led to Metesky's arrest, she declined to claim the $26,000 in rewards, saying she had merely been doing her job.

2500|$|In 1882, Egypt, {{while still}} {{nominally}} {{part of the}} Ottoman Empire, came under effective British rule, and British archaeologists began the systematic exploration of the country. Because Oxyrhynchus was not considered an Ancient Egyptian site of any importance, it was neglected until 1896, when two young excavators, Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt, both fellows of Queen's College, Oxford, began to excavate it. [...] "My first impressions on examining the site were not very favourable," [...] wrote Grenfell. [...] "The rubbish mounds were nothing but rubbish mounds." [...] However, they very soon realized what they had found. The unique combination of climate and circumstance had left at Oxyrhynchus an unequalled archive of the ancient world. [...] "The flow of papyri soon became a torrent," [...] Grenfell recalled. [...] "Merely <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> soil with one's boot would frequently disclose a layer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critic website Stereo Board {{stated that}} [...] "Alesha's fearlessly {{powerful}} vocals with an unforgettable, anthemic chorus that {{is set to}} make it a sure-fire radio sensation." [...] Female First gave the single four out of five stars, stating there were [...] "in love with it". Others criticised the song, saying it sounded like [...] "Dixon [...] unknowingly sample Robyn's 'Dancing on My Own'". Another positive review, came from Robert Copsey from Digital Spy who gave 4/5 stars for the song, saying [...] "Upon further listening, the reason for her apathetic approach towards ear candy becomes all too clear. [...] "I'm <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> radio / I'll drown you out / 'Cause I don't want to let you go," [...] she mourns over a combination of jagged beats and throbbing synths that sounds suspiciously like Robyn's own weepy club ballad 'Dancing on My Own'.

2500|$|Mark Kermode, in The Observer, labeled Pan's Labyrinth as {{the best}} film of 2006, {{describing}} it as [...] "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film [...] "works on so many levels {{that it seems to}} change shape even as you watch it", and Jim Emerson called the film [...] "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth was #1, with him stating [...] "But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was Pan's Labyrinth." [...] The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it [...] "discards any hint of the ethereal by <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter...." ...|$|E
