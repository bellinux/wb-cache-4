2500|$|In 1910, Black Americans owned 15,000,000 {{acres of}} land, {{most of it}} in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This figure has since {{declined}} to 5,500,000 acres in 1980 and to 2,000,000 acres in 1997. Most of this land is not the area held by Black families in 1910; beyond the [...] "Black Belt", it is located in Texas, Oklahoma, and California. The total number of Black farmers has decreased from 925,708 in 1920 to 18,000 in 1997; the number of White farmers has also decreased, but much more slowly. Black American land ownership has diminished more than that of any other ethnic group, while White land ownership has increased. Black families who inherit land across generations without obtaining an explicit title (often resulting in <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> by multiple descendents) may have difficulty gaining government benefits and risk losing their land completely. Outright fraud and lynchings have also been used to strip Black people of their land.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{vacancies}} on the Board of Supervisors {{prior to}} 2000, Brown {{was able to}} appoint 8 of the 11 members of the board. Due {{to a change in}} San Francisco's election laws that took effect in 2000, the board changed from at-large to district based elections, and all seats on the board were up for election. The voters elected a new group of supervisors that ran on changing the city’s development policy. Voters also passed a measure that weakened the mayor's control over the Planning Commission and Board of Appeals. The new majority limited Brown's power over the Elections Department, the Police Commission, and extending San Francisco International Airport's runways into the bay to reduce flight delays. In July 2001, the Board of Supervisors overrode Brown’s veto for the first time, creating legislation that created the new home ownership option of <b>tenancies</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{economic}} impact of death is seen when the deceased {{does not have a}} will, and land is bequeathed to multiple people, under intestacy law, as <b>tenancies</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> (Mitchell 2000:507-508). Frequently, the recipients of such property do not realize that if one of the common owners wishes to sell their share, then the entire estate can be put up for partition sale. Most state statutes suggest that partition in kind be preferred over partition sale, except where properties cannot be divided equitably for the parties involved; however, many courts opt to require properties be put up for partition sale because the monetary value of the land is higher as a single parcel than a number of subdivided parcels, and also, to some extent, because the utility value of rural land is higher if it can be used a single productive unit (Mitchell 2000:514-515;563).|$|R

40|$|The {{pattern of}} landownership {{in the rural}} African American {{community}} represents the mirror opposite of the trend in black land acquisition 100 {{years ago at the}} dawn of the twentieth century. Remarkable levels of acquisition have been replaced by extraordinary levels of land loss in the past half-century or so. Today, African American farm owner-operators on little more than 2 million acres of land in the United States. Land loss in rural African American communities far exceeds farmland lost by white farmers. Even American Indian landowners-a group whose current land base represents but a fraction of its ancestral landholdings-have fared better than rural African American landowners over the past 50 to 60 years. This paper focuses on one of the primary causes of involuntary black land loss in recent times-partition sales of black-owned land held under <b>tenancies</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> Our society has a clear moral obligation to reverse the processes that have stripped black landowners of their land. This paper advocates government intervention to promote enhanced landownership-both quantitatively and qualitatively-for African Americans. This paper maintains that the problem of fractionated heir property within the rural, African American community justifies more fundamental reform of common property law and the creation of government institutions that would have the capacity to help those who own heir property restructure their ownership in a way that the ownership could be stabilized and the property could be used productively.

50|$|TIC owners own {{percentages}} in an undivided property {{rather than}} particular units or apartments, and their deeds show only their ownership percentages. The {{right of a}} particular TIC owner to use a particular dwelling comes from a written contract signed by all co-owners (often called a “Tenancy In Common Agreement”), not from a deed, map or other document recorded in county records.

After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys now often advise clients to also create a living will.

50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A joint {{co-owner}} may break a {{joint tenancy}} and maintain {{an interest in the}} property. Most jurisdictions permit a joint owner to {{break a joint}} tenancy by the execution of a document to that effect.

This requires another person to [...] "buy" [...] the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price.

50|$|This {{means that}} a land {{developer}} can purchase one person's share of a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and then use their position to force a partition sale of the entireproperty.
