5|$|In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the}} thrones of Austria-Hungary, {{was assassinated}} by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden {{deterioration}} in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary {{was supported by the}} German Empire, whilst Serbia had <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Three Democratic {{candidates}} {{had announced}} intentions {{to run for}} governor in 1899—Goebel, former Kentucky Attorney General P. Wat Hardin, and former congressman William J. Stone. Hardin, a native of Mercer County, had <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Lyon County's Stone had <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's agricultural interests. Goebel generally had the backing of urban voters. Going into the party's nominating convention, Hardin was the favorite to win the nomination. Knowing that combining forces {{was the only way to}} prevent Hardin's nomination, representatives of Goebel and Stone met on June 19, 1899, to work out a deal. According to Urey Woodson, a Goebel representative at the meeting, the two sides signed an agreement whereby half of the Louisville delegation, which was committed to Goebel, would vote for Stone. Both men agreed that, should one of them be defeated or withdraw from the race, they would encourage their delegates to vote for the other rather than support Hardin.|$|E
5|$|A wealthy {{resident}} of al-Rahba, Ibn Mahkan, revolted against the Fatimids and {{took control of}} the town shortly after Lu'lu departed. Though able to oust the Fatimid governor, Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al-Rahba was located amid the crossroads of several regional powers who coveted the town. Thus, he gained <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe, Salih ibn Mirdas. Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al-Rahba. The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar. However, when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah, the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan.|$|E

In {{accordance}} with state law, the Chief Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court appointed a temporary replacement, attorney Thomas A. Jaconetty, 34, a deputy assessor with the Board of (Tax) Appeals since 1981. Jaconnetty was a 31st ward resident {{and the secretary}} of Berrios' 31st ward Democratic organization with whom Berrios had been a precinct captain in the 31st Ward under Alderman Keane.

On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British government.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of October 5/6, Zvi Zamir went to Europe to meet {{personally}} with Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian double agent. Marwan informed Zamir that a joint Egyptian-Syrian attack was imminent. Combined with other warnings and incidents, Marwan's warning finally convinced Zvi Zamir of the imminence of war. Eli Zeira, the director of Aman, sent a definite warning of war to the Israeli leadership at 04:30 on October 6. Aman erred when it concluded the Arabs were to attack at 18:00, an estimation in fact four hours late. Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir met with Defence Minister Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar at 08:05 for over an hour. Meir asked both men to present their views, which were conflicting: Dayan continued to believe war was not a certainty, while Elazar believed otherwise, arguing for a preemptive air strike against Syria. Dayan also proposed a partial mobilization of reserves, while Elazar favored a mobilization of the entire Air Force, and four armored divisions, totaling around 100,000–120,000 troops. Meir concluded the meeting by stating that no preemptive strike would be launched, {{in order to ensure}} <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, but she sided with Elazar on the issue of mobilization, and orders were issued to reservists to mobilize.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating a through route from Aylesbury to Oxford. If built, the line {{would have been the}} shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by the costly tunnelling proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed, in which the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid tunnelling. In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one of their two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E

5|$|In February 1975, a pro-Palestinian Lebanese MP, Maarouf Saad, {{was shot}} and killed, {{reportedly}} by the Lebanese Army. His death, from his wounds, the following month, and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and Lebanese travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist forces, precipitated the Lebanese Civil War. Arafat was reluctant to respond with force, but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise. For example, the DFLP carried out several attacks against the Lebanese Army. In 1976, an alliance of Christian militias with <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lebanese and Syrian armies besieged Tel al-Zaatar camp in east Beirut. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more. The Tel al-Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six-month siege in which thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed.

The next year al-Bakri co-founded the first legal political party in Faisal's Syria, the pan-Arabist al-Istiqlal ("Independence") which sought to unify all the former Ottoman-held Arab territories under the leadership of the Hashemites.

5|$|Meanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, William Adelin, {{died in the}} White Ship {{disaster}} of 1120, leaving England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to Normandy by her father, who arranged for her to marry Geoffrey of Anjou to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an oath of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the Anglo-Norman court. Henry died in 1135 but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the Norman barons and were unable to pursue their claims. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin Stephen of Blois, who enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Church.
