40|$|AbstractThe <b>tail</b> drive <b>shaft</b> (TDS) of a {{helicopter}} is vital component {{which is responsible for}} its stability, is often prone to impact damage during combat and is damaged. Usually when the <b>tail</b> drive <b>shaft</b> is damaged, it is replaced during maintenance. But during the time of conflict, the replacement shaft may not always be available. Hence the damaged shaft is patched by a repair technique known as adhesively bonded repair technique or Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) technique. In this study, finite element analysis is carried out on the undamaged, damaged, and the patched model of the <b>tail</b> drive <b>shaft,</b> which determines that the deformation, stress and strain in the patched model of the shaft is reduced. Thus, the adhesively bonded repair is an emergency technique that is used to regain the static strength shaft. Mechanical characterization of Kevlar/Epoxy composite material is carried out to choose the apt lay-up sequence for the patch by evaluating its mechanical properties...|$|R
50|$|Having reached Pearl Harbor on 26 July, Apogon was dry-docked. Both <b>tail</b> <b>shafts</b> were {{replaced}} and realigned, and the periscope, periscope shears, and the radar masts {{were replaced}}. The three main engines were also overhauled. On 12 September, Apogon was underway {{on yet another}} wartime patrol. She headed for the Kuril Islands area. The submarine claimed to have sunk a Japanese patrol craft on 23 September, but this kill was not confirmed. Four days later, she sank Hachirogata Maru. Following this sinking, she rescued two Japanese survivors. The next month proved fruitless, and Apogon arrived at Midway on 28 October, ending her fifth patrol.|$|R

50|$|In November 2003, Australian race team Prancing Horse Racing Scuderia {{imported}} an E36 M3 GTR from America as {{a replacement}} for their Ferrari 360 N-GT to race in the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour race at the famous Mount Panorama Circuit with plans to keep the car in Australia to race in the 2004 Australian Nations Cup Championship for GT style cars. The GTR, powered by an almost stock 5.0 litre BMW N62 V8 engine, arrived in Australia only a week before the Bathurst 24 Hour race and after a rushed preparation, multiple Australian championship winning driver John Bowe qualified the car in 3rd place. After running easily in the top 5 for the first few hours of the race, the car suffered its first problem when a <b>tail</b> <b>shaft</b> broke. The car was eventually retired after 131 laps with damage after a clash with the race winning Holden Monaro 427C of Peter Brock. Ultimately PHR Scuderia did not compete in the Nations Cup Championship in 2004 with the Bathurst 24 Hour being its only race in the country.|$|E
50|$|A lugworm {{lives in}} a U-shaped burrow in sand. The U is made of an L-shaped gallery lined with mucus, from the toe of which a {{vertical}} unlined shaft runs up to the surface. This is a head shaft. At the surface the head shaft {{is marked by a}} small saucer-shaped depression. The <b>tail</b> <b>shaft,</b> 2 to 3 in from it, is marked by a highly coiled cast of sand. The lugworm lies in this burrow with its head {{at the base of the}} head shaft, swallowing sand from time to time. This makes the columns of sand drop slightly, so there is a periodic sinking of the sand in the saucer-shaped depression. When it first digs its burrow the lugworm softens the sand in its head shaft by pushing its head up into it with a piston action. After that the sand is kept loose by a current of water driven through the burrow from the hind end by the waves of contraction passing along the worm's body. It weighs 2 to 5 oz. Lugworms also have hairs on the outside of their bodies that act as external gills. These can rapidly increase its uptake of oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Fazilka {{was used}} to carry troops from India to South Africa during the Boer war. She left Port Natal on 30 January 1900 to make the return trip to India. Four days after passing through the Mozambique Channel the <b>tail</b> <b>shaft</b> broke. The shaft had broken in two places {{partially}} rupturing the stern tube, so the first requirement was to shift ballast and get the stern out of the water. Attempts were made to rig sails but progress was slow and after an attempt to tow, the engineers under Mr. Brown worked in intolerable conditions to repair the shaft. The repairs were complicated and after various failures {{it was decided to}} take down the high pressure engine and use the bottom end brasses as a clamp. This was effective in holding the shaft and then the rear end breakage was connected by a Thomson coupling. Using the low pressure engines only, Fazilka was able to make Colombo at a speed of 9 knots km/h. This {{was one of the most}} heroic ship repairs at sea and the Engineers were rewarded accordingly.
