Thus far no study has attempted to measure all relevant site conditions in {{a larger number of}} alpine communities. Here we show (1) which environ-mental factors were highly correlated with the floristic composition of the 14 plant com-munities investigated in the Swiss Alps and (2) which plant communities have similar environmental affinities. In every plant community investigated, the main factors poten-tially having an impact on plant life were measured and the floristic composition was defined. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to determine linkage between plant communities and complex environmental gradients. The first axis of the NMDS corresponds to a climate gradient (temperature/wind speed), and the second axis corresponds to a soil gradient (soil suction/pH/Ca content). With the exception of the Nardus grassland and Carex curvula <b>turf,</b> <b>plant</b> communities belonging to the same phy-tosociological class are exposed to very similar combinations of environmental factors. Our study shows that the variation between phytosociological classes is much larger than within classes. Still, the variation of environmental factors within individual classes leads to a further differentiation of the floristic composition. Thus, our study reinforces the valid-ity of the phytosociological classification.
