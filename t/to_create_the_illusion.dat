5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of underwater swimming.|$|E
5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E

50|$|Changes {{in theater}} design complemented the new lighting. Early 17th century theater-houses, which were often {{converted}} tennis courts, were not conducive <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> {{of a single}} vantage point on the stage. Instead, the boxes often faced each other and an audience member in the parterre would be equally comfortable looking into the loges.|$|R

5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E

5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the plates <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> {{that they were being}} destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E
5000|$|Trompe-l'œil (French for [...] "deceive the eye", {{pronounced}} [...] ) {{is an art}} {{technique that}} uses realistic imagery <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> optical <b>illusion</b> that <b>the</b> depicted objects exist in three dimensions.

40|$|Contrary to {{the common}} {{definition}} of still life painting as a grouping of inanimate objects, I want my still life paintings {{to be full of}} life. I have always been intrigued by the numerous approaches and different mediums used by artists for still life arrangements. I want the objects I paint to appear three dimensional. I strive <b>to</b> effectively <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of actual senses: smell, taste, and touch. To accomplish this, I carefully arrange objects in my composition so color, line, and form work to enhance a rhythmic flow. Contrasting warm and cool colors help add to this flow. My brush strokes turn with the curve of <b>the</b> objects <b>to</b> help <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of depth and motion. This is what I call the Un-Still Life...|$|R

50|$|An {{autostereogram}} is a single-image stereogram (SIS), designed <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> visual <b>illusion</b> of {{a three-dimensional}} (3D) {{scene from a}} two-dimensional image. In order to perceive 3D shapes in these autostereograms, one must overcome the normally automatic coordination between accommodation (focus) and horizontal vergence (angle of one's eyes). <b>The</b> <b>illusion</b> is one of depth perception and involves stereopsis: depth perception arising from the different perspective each eye has of a three-dimensional scene, called binocular parallax.|$|R
50|$|Mirror glasses {{may be used}} <b>to</b> help <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of openness. <b>The</b> mirrors are angled at 45 degrees, {{allowing}} the patient to look down their body and out {{the end of the}} imaging area. The appearance is of an open tube pointing upward (as seen when lying in the imaging area). Even though one is able to see around the glasses and the proximity of the device is very evident, this illusion is quite persuasive and relieves the claustrophobic feeling.|$|R
50|$|Several {{days after}} the story broke, {{suspicion}} mounted over {{the authenticity of the}} photographic evidence. Retired New York University physicist, Dr. Richard Brandt, used perspective geometry to demonstrate that either the pig was 15 ft long (far bigger than claimed) or the boy in the photo was standing several meters behind the pig, using forced perspective <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> optical <b>illusion</b> that <b>the</b> animal was larger than its actual size. Others claim the photographs were digitally altered.|$|R

25|$|The effects expert Eugen Schüfftan created {{pioneering}} {{visual effects}} for Metropolis. Among the effects used are miniatures of the city, a camera on a swing, and most notably, the Schüfftan process, in which mirrors are used <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> that actors are occupying miniature sets. This new technique was seen again {{just two years}} later in Alfred Hitchcock's film Blackmail (1929).|$|E
25|$|Steve McQueen's {{likeness}} as Frank Bullitt {{was used}} in two Ford commercials. The first was for the Europe-only 1997 Ford Puma, which featured a special effects montage of McQueen (who died in 1980) driving a new Puma around San Francisco before parking it in a studio apartment garage beside the film Mustang and the motorcycle from The Great Escape. In a 2004 commercial for the 2005 Mustang, special effects are again used <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of McQueen driving the new Mustang, after a man receives a Field of Dreams-style epiphany and constructs a racetrack {{in the middle of}} a cornfield.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43) The labors {{of vision}} <b>create</b> <b>the</b> {{view of a}} world in which persistence and change act as eternal antagonists. Changes are perceived as mere accidentals of underlying persistent identity, but perception also reveals constancy as the shortsighted look of change. Art is a personal creation of man.

The artist shares his reality with the viewer; all art is conditional upon the viewer and his response to the work. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE My artwork principally evolved as a two-dimensional statement of aesthetic elements. My intentions are primarily <b>to</b> <b>create</b> sophisticated images which resemble painted images. Secondly, I intended <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusions</b> of energy and movement within these two-dimensional images, using shapes and lines. Finally, I wished to communicate the artistic experiences and influences of a childhood in my native Iran which were combined with those received in an American university education. In the execution of these intentions, I also explored and expanded my creativity in the area of mixed media. (See more in text. ...|$|R
5000|$|Coming {{from this}} phenomenological {{perspective}} on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S-R (stimulus-response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach <b>to</b> psychology <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of [...] "scientific objectivity" [...] {{while at the}} same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions. Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from Kurt Lewin in Chapter 9 of Grundlegung der Psychologie.|$|R
