5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the {{expanded}} offerings did not contribute well to the series, alongside the late-2000s recession; sales of most rhythm games including Guitar Hero and DJ Hero did not meet expectations, falling about 50% short of projected targets. Activision announced it would be cutting back to only 10 SKUs within 2010 instead of the 25 in 2009. Though RedOctane and Neversoft continued to develop the 6th main game, , until its completion, both studios were later shuttered by Activision, moving key personnel into Activision directly for future game development, {{and in the case}} of Neversoft, closing its Guitar Hero division, while transferring future development duties for the series to Vicarious Visions, another Activision studio which had been fundamental in building the Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the games. In November 2010, Activision also closed Budcat Creations, <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> publisher that was primarily responsible for porting the Guitar Hero games to the PlayStation 2.|$|E

25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney {{portion of the}} skull {{at the back of}} the ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E

25|$|The {{extraction}} of conjugated estrogens from the urine of pregnant mares {{led to the}} marketing in 1943 of the first HRT treatment, Premarin. From that time until 1975, estrogen was administered without supplemental progesterone or progestin. A study from Kaiser Permanente by Dr. Harry Ziel demonstrated that {{in the absence of}} progesterone, patients were at increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen therapy. After this, progestin was supplemented in women who had not received surgical hysterectomy, to reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. This was followed by the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002. However, <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WHI receiving combined Estrogen and Progesterone therapy was closed prematurely by its Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{condemned}} {{person is}} swabbed with alcohol before the cannula is inserted. The needles and equipment used are sterilized. Questions {{have been raised}} about why these precautions against infection are performed despite {{the purpose of the}} injection being death. The several explanations include: cannulae are sterilized during manufacture, so using sterile ones is routine medical procedure. Secondly, the prisoner could receive a stay of execution after the cannulae have been inserted, as happened in the case of James Autry in October 1983 (he was eventually executed on March 14, 1984). Third, use of unsterilized equipment would be a hazard to prison personnel.|$|E

25|$|One French thrust was {{directed}} at occupying the strategic Hansel-Grund salient, east of Lobau island, which a brigade under Conroux secured towards 22:00. This allowed the French to deploy three pivoting bridges, which had been prepared in advance and on which other elements of Oudinot's II Corps began to cross. Meanwhile, further north, Colonel Sainte-Croix, aide-de-camp to Maréchal Masséna had 1,500 men of IV Corps embarked on landing craft and crossed the river, without meeting any opposition. Sainte-Croix's pontonniers then started work and, making good use of the current, managed to bridge <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danube in {{no more than five}} minutes, using another pivoting bridge. This allowed Masséna's divisions to begin crossing, while the division commanded by Legrand, already on the northern bank since 2 July, made a feint towards Aspern and Essling, in a bid to divert Austrian attention from the actual crossing. Several other bridges were finalised towards 02:00, allowing the bulk of II and III Corps, with their respective artillery, cavalry and equipment trains to cross to the northern bank. Napoleon ordered the pontonniers to build three additional bridges and work continued well after dawn on 5 July, after the bulk of the Grande Armée had already crossed the river. The battle had begun.|$|E
