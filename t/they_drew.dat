5|$|Association with Koren – in America, Speyer was {{friendly}} with John Koren, an American statistician {{who represented the}} United States on the International Prisons Commission. In 1916, Speyer had funded a fact-finding trip by Koren to Europe, during which Koren visited Germany and met Speyer's sister and friends. Although the committee considered the trip strange, <b>they</b> <b>drew</b> no inference of disloyalty from the events.|$|E

5|$|Babangida {{only made}} his African Nations Cup debut in 2000 as Nigeria {{withdrew from the}} 1996 edition in South Africa due to {{political}} reasons and missed out on 1998 African Cup of Nations through disqualification. Babangida scored two spectacular goals against South Africa to put Nigeria through to the final against Cameroon, where <b>they</b> <b>drew</b> 2–2, before being narrowly defeated 3–4 on penalties. He appeared {{in all of his}} team's five games, starting two.|$|E

The Red Devils then won the second leg 1–0 – Ronaldo scoring the only goal – to ensure a 2–1 aggregate win and {{a place in the}} quarter-finals, where they were again drawn against Roma.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} unlikely that Liverpool {{would win the}} league.

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside {{a short period of}} time to write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which was reflected in the title. Following the album's release, the group set out on tour, where <b>they</b> <b>drew</b> an enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E
5|$|They were {{defeated}} in their Test against Australia {{and in all}} three against the All Blacks. The All Blacks' side was particularly strong and won all its Tests between 1965 and 1970.

Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, <b>they</b> <b>drew</b> with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.|$|E
5|$|After not {{appearing}} {{in either the}} 1986 or the 1988 Gulf Cup of Nations, Saeed played in the 1988 President's Cup Football Tournament where he scored three goals; Iraq were knocked out in the quarter-finals.

Iraq won their first game against Bahrain 1–0 and drew their second game with Kuwait 1–1. <b>They</b> <b>drew</b> again in their third match against the UAE 2–2 draw. Iraq withdrew from the tournament after the game with the UAE, because of the refereeing, which was Saeed's last match in his football career before he decided to retire {{at the age of}} 32 in the same year.|$|E

Yorkshire fielded a weakened team, and were subsequently defeated 10–6 by the Natives, who scored six tries.

5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and <b>they</b> <b>drew</b> American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{qualified}} for the play-offs after <b>they</b> <b>drew</b> Goa at the Salt Lake Stadium 1–1 on 10 December 2014. Edgar Marcelino scored first to give Goa the lead before Fikru scored the equalizer for Kolkata. In the semi-finals, Atlético de Kolkata once again took on Goa. The first leg at the Salt Lake Stadium ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg at the Fatorda Stadium also ended 0–0 and after the tie could not be settled in extra-time that meant the game went into penalty-kicks. Atlético de Kolkata won the shoot-out 4–2 after André Santos and Zohib Islam Amiri missed their penalties for Goa and Kolkata converted all four of theirs.|$|E

The group completed AWPD-1 in the allotted nine days and carefully rehearsed a presentation to the Army General Staff. Its forecast figures, despite planning errors from lack of accurate information about weather and the German economic commitment to the war, were within 2 percent of the units and 5.5 percent of the personnel ultimately mobilized, and it accurately predicted the time frame when the invasion of Europe by the Allies would take place.|$|E
