5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{which held}} that §8772 does not {{infringe}} on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E
5|$|The four Democratic judges concurred on <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion.</b> Two Republican judges, in a {{separate}} opinion, concurred with <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> but declared that Taylor and Marshall had been done an irreparable injustice. The lone dissent, authored by the court's third Republican, held that the contest board had acted outside its legal authority. Republicans turned to the Supreme Court of the United States as their final option.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. {{recognized}} the Oneida's federal common law cause of action, and rejected all the counties' affirmative defenses.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{says that}} Justice Scalia's {{argument}} concerning the jurisdiction-stripping statute (section 1005e(1)) ignores the effective date provision {{of that very}} statute (section 1005(h)).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{says that}} the government's {{contention}} that the war started on September 11, 2001 undercuts Justice Thomas' argument that it started in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> {{also looked}} at {{the meaning of the}} phrase [...] "false or fraudulent" [...] itself: ...|$|R
5000|$|Emberland {{said that}} [...] "Storrvik is quoting from the dissenting {{opinions}} from verdicts of the ECHR"—at {{least as much}} as he is quoting <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> of <b>the</b> verdicts.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> in Harris v. Quinn {{was largely}} {{condemned}} by labor unions, worker rights organizations , and the Democratic Party for overturning established precedent since the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{notes that}} {{language}} in the Congressional Record that the Scalia dissent cites was inserted into the Record after the legislation had been enacted, by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ), and includes falsified quotations attributed to other persons.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in the case, and that the court lacked jurisdiction. The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals' assertion that an elective office was not property. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving {{a rationale for}} a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision prepared the way for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.|$|E
50|$|In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> did not {{question}} {{the ability of}} the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation under its powers relating to peace, order and good government or trade and commerce.|$|R
5000|$|Sears dissented from <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> in McIntyre v. State (1995). Justice Sears {{argued that}} the defendant’s murder {{conviction}} should have been overturned because a judge was substituted {{in the middle of}} trial.|$|R
5000|$|Sears dissented from <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> in Lumpkin v. Johnson (1998). Justice Sears argued to {{overturn}} a murder conviction after {{concluding that the}} system by which cases are assigned to trial judges is impermissible.|$|R
5|$|Although, in many areas, Scalia's {{approach}} was unfavorable to criminal defendants, {{he took the}} side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that defendants must {{have the opportunity to}} confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that the}} government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Both {{cases were}} {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the highest court in Kentuckyin 1823. In the case of Blair, the debt relief {{position}} was argued by George M. Bibb, while the anti-relief position was represented by Robert Wickliffe. In Lapsley, Wickliffe joined George Robertson and Ben Hardin to represent the anti-relief position, while the relief position was argued by John Rowan and William T. Barry. Chief Justice John Boyle wrote <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in Blair on October 8, 1823, and Associate Justice William Owsley issued the court's opinion in Lapsley three days later. In both cases, the anti-relief position was upheld.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> {{was written}} by Justice Samuel Miller; joining him were Justices Stephen Field, John Harlan, William Woods, Thomas Matthews, and Samuel Blatchford. Dissenting were Chief Justice Morrison Waite and Justices Joseph Bradley and Horace Gray.|$|R

50|$|Justice Brennan also {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> only addressed <b>the</b> privacy issue of a person's property, and ignored the possessory issues. He claimed that this could lead to pretext searches, which in his view should be suppressed.|$|R
5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> since then.|$|E
5|$|However, Black wrote <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese {{internment}} during World War II. Black also consistently {{opposed the}} doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld Judge Field's {{decision}} {{by a vote}} of 6–1. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> held that an elected office is not property and thus not subject to the protections guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment. As a creation of the Kentucky Constitution, the court held, any elective office is conferred and held only subject to the provisions of that constitution. This put the matter beyond the reach of any judicial review, according to the court.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Breyer also {{expressed}} a [...] "slippery-slope" [...] concern that <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> {{would lead to}} allowing the police to ask follow-up questions, such as what the person's license number is, or where a person lives, without running afoul of constitutional protections.|$|R
5000|$|The justices' {{opinions}} in Obergefell {{are consistent with}} their {{opinions in}} Windsor which rejected DOMA's recognition of only opposite-sex marriages for certain purposes under federal law. In both cases, Justice Kennedy authored <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> and was considered the [...] "swing vote".|$|R
5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> reached at court conferences.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{presented}} by the NTSB accident report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> for the Court, which {{declined}} {{to overturn the}} state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Breyer also {{expressed}} a [...] "slippery-slope" [...] concern that <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> {{would lead to}} allowing the police to ask follow-up questions, such as what the person's license number is, or where a person lives, without running afoul of constitutional protections.|$|R
50|$|Justice Brennan {{wrote the}} dissenting opinion which {{was joined by}} Justice Marshall and which Justice White concurred in part. Justice Brennan pointed out that <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> <b>opinion</b> was {{inconsistent}} with the Court's prior case law and was unduly restrictive in its construction of the Bill of Rights.|$|R
50|$|He {{authored}} <b>the</b> most <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> at <b>the</b> Supreme Court during 1997, {{his first}} full term.|$|R
