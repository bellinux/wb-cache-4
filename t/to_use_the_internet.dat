40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} ICT {{in public and private}} Sudanese universities. We verify the first and third hypotheses that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of ICT facilitates connection, networks and collaboration within public and private universities in Sudan, with local, regional and international institutions. We support the second hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of ICT enhances access, production and dissemination of knowledge in Sudanese universities. We support the fourth hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of ICT introduces a 'creative-destruction' effect by providing opportunities for knowledge production, building connection and organizational changes; but simultaneously also creates hazards to knowledge production and building disconnection {{for those who do not}} share the knowledge in public and private Sudanese universities. We show that the most important advantages linked <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for enhancing production, creation and transfer of knowledge include the increase of digital knowledge for academic and researchers, the rapid quantitative and qualitative increase in transferring information, the development of new models for disseminating and distributing electronic information, and the increase of free access to electronic publications for academic purposes. We find that the main problem related <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> is <b>the</b> lack of a regular budget for university libraries to pay for licenses and access to scientific and technical information.

This included 24-hour original news segments, weather coverage from a professional meteorologist and Sales Executive dedicated to TV and online advertising.
