40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} interrelationship between <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode choice based on multinomial {{logistic}} model, using 2010 Nanjing resident <b>trip</b> survey data. Unlike previous literatures, <b>trip</b> mode choice {{is divided into}} single-mode and multi-modes in this study. Estimation coefficients verify <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode selection are a pair of choices that influence each other. <b>Trip</b> mode is great positively associated with <b>trip</b> chain pattern of HW+WH, HO+OH, HW+OH, however, in return <b>trip</b> chain pattern {{is the most significant}} negative factor that affects <b>trip</b> mode choice, which means that no <b>trip</b> chain pattern would provoke travelers to select multi-modes. Despite the results seem to reach a contradiction between <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode choice, still two facets of views try to explain the phenomenon, in addition, discussion on the interrelationship between complex <b>trip</b> chain pattern and multi-modes which might put forward more challenges to urban planning is also proposed as well in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{model system}} is {{developed}} to describe both <b>trip</b> generation and <b>trip</b> chaining in a coherent manner. A recursive structure is adopted {{to represent the}} generation of <b>trips</b> for different purposes, {{and the number of}} <b>trip</b> chains is expressed {{as a function of the}} numbers of <b>trips</b> by purpose. The model system offers theoretically consistent coefficient values and quantifies the relationship between the number of <b>trips</b> and the number of <b>trip</b> chains, and can be used in the conventional forecasting procedure in place of home-based and non-home-based <b>trip</b> generation models. This model is applied to examine how <b>trip</b> chaining patterns vary across sample subgroups. The results indicate no significant variations in <b>trip</b> chaining behavior across car ownership subgroups. It is inferred that car ownership influences household <b>trip</b> generation, but given the number of <b>trips</b> generated, the number of <b>trip</b> chains is not influenced by car ownership...|$|R
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, <b>tripping</b> and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing <b>tripping</b> hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E

5|$|In the 1996–1997 NBA season, Rodman won {{his sixth}} {{rebounding}} title {{in a row}} with 16.7boards per game, along with 5.7points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up. However, he made more headlines for his notorious behavior. On January 15, 1997, {{he was involved in}} an incident during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After <b>tripping</b> over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a technical foul at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000settlement, and the league suspended Rodman for 11games without pay. Thus, he effectively lost $1 million. Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as effective in the 1997 NBA Playoffs, in which the Bulls reached the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz.

Stoke {{had a number of}} chances in the later stages of the match, but Cardiff held out for a replay. In the replay at the Cardiff City Stadium Stoke again used several reserves, changing {{all but one of the}} players from the previous league match. Few chances occurred during the game; the score was 0–0 after 90 minutes, prompting extra time. In the added period, Jonathan Walters scored twice to secure a 2–0 Stoke City win; the first goal was a header from a corner, the second a near-post rebound. Stoke City then travelled to fellow Midlands team Wolverhampton Wanderers for the fourth round, in one of five all-Premier League ties. Stoke defender Robert Huth was a central figure in the match. Ten minutes from time he gave Stoke a 1–0 lead with a header from a free-kick, but in the final minute he conceded a penalty for <b>tripping</b> Nenad Milijaš.

5|$|After {{holding out}} for 21 days, Davis was signed {{initially}} to a contract designed as a temporary compromise {{in order to get}} him into training camp on August 5, 1991. It was speculated that the reason behind Davis' holdout and the temporary compromise was that Davis and his agent wanted to see what McRae, who also held out with the Buccaneers, signed for first. Davis was not allowed to practice with the team until he was under contract, thus the compromise contract enabled him to practice while still work to get a long-term deal done. The compromise was a one-year contract with an option for a second year, and Davis received $600,000 in signing the first contract. He was able to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Eagles' third preseason game on August 10. Davis was projected to be the Eagles' starting right offensive tackle for the 1991 season. Davis suffered a sprained ankle while running laps around JFK Stadium and <b>tripping</b> over a goal post support on August 19. Due to the injury, he was taken out of the preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts on August 23 at halftime by Kotite. The Eagles and Davis finalized a five-year contract worth $4.6 million on September 6 following {{the first week of the}} season. Davis changed his jersey number from 77 to 78 after signing the contract. He had his best game of the season in week four against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 22, as Kotite called more run plays to the right side towards the end of the game. Davis had a key block on a Jim McMahon quarterback sneak touchdown and McMahon gave Davis the ball immediately after to spike in celebration. The Eagles were given a five-yard penalty for the spike, however. In a week five game against the Washington Redskins on September 30, Davis gave up two sacks against defensive end Charles Mann, who received Pro Bowl honors after the season. Davis gave up a total of ten sacks in the first five games of the season.|$|E

The addition of Mii characters was made in response to the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game. To prevent potential bullying, as well as to maintain game balance online, Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers. The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the 3DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period. Hardware limitations on the Nintendo 3DS led to various design choices, such as the removal of mid-match transformations, the lack of Circle Pad Pro support, and the absence of the Ice Climbers, from the NES game Ice Climber, who were previously playable in both Melee and Brawl.|$|E
