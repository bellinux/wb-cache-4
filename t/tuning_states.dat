40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study of}} a high-Q resonator in a commercial 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS process for E-band frequencies is presented. The resonator is a planar quarter-wave microstrip resonator that uses a HBT based negative resistance circuit to counter losses and enhance the unloaded Q-factor. Using 3 D EM (FEM) and circuit co-simulation, enhanced unloaded Q-factors of up to 892 are shown at a frequency of 83. 5 GHz compared to the unenhanced unloaded Q-factor of 7. The negative resistance circuit sufficiently compensates for low Q-factors of the planar resonator and the varactor. The resonator is also shown to be continuously tunable in frequency from 82 to 84 GHz, and in unloaded Q-factor from 7 to 892, whilst maintaining unconditional stability in all <b>tuning</b> <b>states.</b> National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF) under Grants 92526 and 93921, {{as well as the}} UNESCO Participation Programme.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first fully tunable substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter implemented with PIN diodes and RF MEMS switches. The methodology for tuning SIW filters is explained in detail {{and is used}} to create three separate designs. Each SIW cavity is tuned by perturbing via posts connecting or disconnecting to/from the cavity's top metal layer. In order to separate the biasing network from the SIW filter, a three-layer PCB is fabricated using Rogers RT/duroid substrates. The first tunable design utilizes the Philips BAP 55 L PIN diode. This two-pole filter provides six frequency states ranging from 1. 55 GHz to 2. 0 GHz. Fractional bandwidth ranges from 2. 3 percent ? 3. 0 percent with insertion loss and return loss better than 5. 4 dB and 14 dB respectively for all frequency <b>tuning</b> <b>states.</b> The second tunable design utilizes the Radant RMSW- 100 MEMS switch, providing six states ranging from 1. 65 GHz to 2. 1 GHz. Fractional bandwidth for this filter varies from 2. 5 percent - 3. 0 percent with insertion loss and return loss better than 12. 4 dB and 16 dB respectively for all states. The third design utilizes the OMRON 2 SMES- 01 RF MEMS relay, providing fourteen states ranging from 1. 19 GHz to 1. 58 GHz. Fractional bandwidth ranges from 3. 6 percent - 4. 4 percent with insertion loss and return loss better than 4. 1 dB and 15 dB respectively for all frequency states. Two of the three designs (Philips PIN diode and OMRON MEMS) produced good results validating the new SIW filter tuning methodology. Finally, to illustrate the advantage of microstrip planar structures integrated with SIW structures, low pass filters (LPFs) are implemented along the input and output microstrip-to-SIW transition regions of the tunable SIW filter. With minimal change to the overall filter size, this provides spurious suppression for the additional resonant modes inherently present in waveguide structures. The implemented design utilizes the same OMRON MEMS tunable SIW filter specifications. This two-pole tunable filter provides the same performance as the previous OMRON MEMS design with exception to an added 0. 7 dB insertion loss and spurious suppression of - 28 dB up to 4. 0 GHz for all frequency <b>tuning</b> <b>states...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted toMultiobjective Optimization Design (MOOD) {{procedures}} for controller tuning applications, {{by means of}} EvolutionaryMultiobjective Optimization (EMO). With such purpose, developments on tools, procedures and guidelines to facilitate this process have been realized. This thesis is divided in four parts. The first part, namely Fundamentals, is devoted on the one hand, to cover the theorical background required for this Thesis; on the other hand, it provides {{a state of the}} art review on current applications of MOOD for controller tuning. The second part, Preliminary contributions on controller <b>tuning,</b> <b>states</b> early contributions using the MOOD procedure for controller tuning, identifying gaps on methodologies and tools used in this procedure. The contribution within this part is to identify the gaps between the three fundamental steps of theMOOD procedure: problemdefinition, search and decisionmaking. These gaps are the basis for the developments presented in parts III and IV. The third part, Contributions on MOOD tools, is devoted to improve the tools used in Part II. Although applications on the scope of this thesis are related to controller tuning, such improvements can also be used in other engineering fields. The first contribution regards the decision making process, where tools and guidelines for design concepts comparison in m-dimensional Pareto fronts are stated. The second contribution focuses on amending the gap between search process and decisionmaking. With this in mind, a mechanism for preference inclusion within the evolutionary process is developed. With this it is possible to calculate pertinent approximations of the Pareto front; furthermore, it allows to deal efficiently with many-objective and constrained optimization instances. Finally, in the fourth part, Final contributions on controller tuning, a stochastic sampling procedure for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers is proposed, to guarantee that (1) any sampled controller will stabilize the closed loop and (2) any stabilizing controller could be sampled. Afterwards, two control engineering benchmarks are solved using this sampling strategy, the MOOD guidelines highlighted trough this Thesis for multivariable controller tuning and the tools developed in Part III.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for new wireless services and applications, {{the high level of}} integration and the coexistence of multi-standard (MS) or multi-band operations into a single device are becoming defining trends in designing microwave filters. This has driven considerable technological advances in reconfigurable/tunable and miniaturized filters. More specifically, reconfigurable/tunable filters that tune to different frequency bands instead of classical filter banks have great potential to significantly reduce the system size and complexity; while reducing the filter size becomes essential to achieve the highest degree of integration density in compact and portable wireless devices. In the light of this scenario, the objective of this dissertation is to develop the new design technologies, concepts and filtering configurations for tunable microstrip filters and compact passive microwave filters. To this aim, this dissertation is divided into two main parts. The first part (Part I) focuses on the designs of novel varactor-tuned microstrip filters with advanced performances. In this aspect, new topologies for realizing tunable lowpass and highpass filters are firstly developed. State-of-the-art performances, including wide tuning range, high selectivity with multiple transmission zeros, low insertion loss and compact size for all the <b>tuning</b> <b>states</b> are obtained in both of these filters. Secondly, two novel classes of tunable bandpass filters are presented. One of them is designed based on varactor-loaded parallel-coupled microstrip lines (PCML) and short-circuited stubs, which allows the lower passband edge together with two transmission zeros located around the lower passband skirt to be reconfigured separately. While the other tunable bandpass filter is constructed by the combination of tunable bandpass and lowpass filters, featuring both centre frequency and bandwidth tunabilities, as well as high selectivity with abundant transmission zeros. Furthermore, a new concept of tunable lossy filter is demonstrated, which attempts to achieve an equivalent high-Q tunable performance by using low-Q resonators. This concept makes the presented tunable combline filter interesting for some frequency-agile applications in which the low in-band loss variation and high selectivity are much desired while the absolute insertion loss can be a tradeoff. The second part (Part II) is devoted to the design of miniaturized passive microwave filters with improved characteristics. For this, the concept of artificial right-handed and left-handed transmission lines are applied to the signal interference filtering topology, which results in a compact circuit size and good out-of-band performance. In particular, for a further size reduction, such filter is implemented in the forms of multilayered structure by using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology. Additionally, another two types of miniaturized bandpass filters using stepped impedance resonators are demonstrated, which are implemented based on different fabrication processes (i. e. LCP bonded multilayer PCB technology and a standard planar PCB technology). Among their main features, the compact size, wide passband, broad stopband with multiple transmission zeros and circuit simplicity are highlighted. For all the proposed design techniques and filtering structures, exhaustive theoretical analyses are done, and design equations and guide rules are provided. Furthermore, all the proposed schemes and/or ideas have been experimentally validated through the design, implementation and measurement of different filters. The fabrication processes of multilayer technology utilized: liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) bonded multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology, are also demonstrated for reference. All of the results achieved in this dissertation make the proposed filters very attractive for their use in modern wireless communication systems...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} filter {{parameters}} on the phase noise of RF MEMS tunable filters employing shunt capacitive switches is investigated in this article. It is {{shown that the}} phase noise of a tunable filter {{is dependent on the}} input power, fractional bandwidth, filter order, resonator quality factor, and <b>tuning</b> <b>state.</b> Phase noise is higher for filters with smaller frac-tional bandwidth. In filters with high fractional bandwidth (> 3 %), phase noise increases as the input power approaches the power-handling capability of the filter. In filters with smaller bandwidths, phase noise increases with input power upto a threshold level of input power, but begins to decrease thereafter. The unloaded quality factor of the filter has a no-ticeable effect on the phase noise of filters with narrow bandwidths. The phase noise changes with the filter <b>tuning</b> <b>state</b> and is maximum when all the switches are in the up-state position. It is also shown that the phase noise increases with the filter order, due to {{increase in the number of}} noisy elements in the filter structure. This article provides a methodology to evaluate the phase noise of a tunable filter and proves that RF MEMS fil-ters are suitable for high performance applications without considerable phase-noise pen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cardy has {{recently}} observed that certain carefully <b>tuned</b> <b>states</b> of 1 + 1 CFTs on a timelike strip are periodic with period {{set by the}} light-crossing time. The states in question are defined by Euclidean time evolution of conformal boundary states associated with the particular boundary conditions imposed {{on the edges of}} the strip. We explain this behavior, and the associated lack of thermalization, by showing that such states are Lorentz-signature conformal transformations of the strip ground state. Taking the long-strip limit implies that states used to model thermalization on the Minkowski plane admit non-thermal conformal extensions beyond future infinity of the Minkowski plane, and thus retain some notion of non-thermal behavior at late times. We also comment on the holo-graphic description of these states. ar X i...|$|R
