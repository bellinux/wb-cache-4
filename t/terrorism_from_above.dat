40|$|This paper {{explains}} how {{the intensification of}} globalization as the modern world system has increased the occurrence of <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> <b>above</b> (i. e. state actors) and from below (i. e. non-state actors). We cannot adequately grasp the essence and characteristics of modern terrorism without understanding the larger cultural, social, economic, and political contexts in which it takes place. Since terrorism has been conceptualized, defined, and theorized {{by those who have}} contradictory interests and objectives and since the subject matter of terrorism is complex, difficult, and elusive, there is a wide gap in establishing a common understanding among the scholars of terrorism studies. Most experts on the subject look at this issue from a narrow perspective by ignoring the reality that terrorism is a “social cancer” for all human groups affected by it. First, this paper defines the concept of terrorism in relation to different forms of terrorism, and {{explains how}} it has increased with the intensification of globalization. Second, taking the events of 9 / 11 and the case of Ethiopian state terrorism, the piece explores the general impacts of all forms of terrorism...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the development of}} Transcaucasian social-democratic <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> 1901 to 1909. For two reasons the ‘psychohistorical’ model emphasising the subjective and irrational aspects of terrorism has only limited value for the Transcaucasian case. First, {{the significance of the}} contextual factor is powerfully underscored by the phenomenon of workers' ‘economic terrorism’. It was not uncommon even, for workers to blackmail reluctant party organisations into supporting the killing of their enemies. Secondly, the social democrats were not driven by irrational urges but followed a rationally motivated and selective terrorist strategy. They attempted to limit or prevent workers' <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> below, the ‘anarchist’ potential of which they considered a threat to the organised mass struggle. They set their hopes on a division of labour, with a militant but mostly peaceful workers' movement and terrorism as the prerogative of the party...|$|R
5000|$|Terrorism {{was largely}} ignored by sociologists prior to September 11, 2001. The most {{comprehensive}} study into {{the definition of}} <b>terrorism</b> comes <b>from</b> a study by Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler (2004) who examined 73 definitions of <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> 55 articles and concluded that terrorism is: [...] "a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role." [...] However, Weinberg et al. point out that definitions of terrorism often ignore symbolic aspects of terrorism. Due to its focus on symbolism, sociology has a unique vantage point from which to assess terror.|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record {{may be found}} at: [URL] {{offering}} few if any policy options for counterterrorism measures.

This article, therefore, aims to do four things: define and differentiate religiously motivated <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> traditional terrorism; investigate three goals of religious terrorism (fomenting the apocalypse, creating a religious government, and establishing a religiously pure state); consider the role of leadership and target selection of religious terrorists; and, finally, suggest a range of counterterrorism strategies based on these observations...|$|R

40|$|A popular {{view is that}} {{international}} terrorism is on the increase, that it is religiously motivated {{and that it has}} important adverse consequences. This paper investigates this view. It examines the empirical evidence on the causes of international <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> the late 1960 s to the early 2000 s and discovers that, while religion has had a part to play, explanations based on economics and politics appear to be consistent with the facts. Terrorists come from relatively poor and undemocratic countries and commit attacks in relatively rich and democratic ones. The paper then examines the micro, macro and global economic effects of international <b>terrorism</b> <b>from</b> both a theoretical and empirical angle, and discovers that the negative effect on domestic aggregate demand is temporary and the effect on aggregate supply insignificant. Finally, the paper explores policies to deal with international terrorism and demonstrates that this is complex. Analogies with conventional crime may be unhelpful.
