5|$|The U-boat base at Bergen grew {{exponentially}} {{after the}} liberation of France by the Western Allies, when the senior commanding officer of U-boat operations in the west ("FdU West") was moved from Angers, France to the city. A large expansion program was conducted at the base and several new anti-aircraft guns were set up to protect the U-boat bunkers. More engineers and technicians were moved to Bergen to accommodate the increased <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> of the base as well. Two more bunkers named Werft Gemeinschaftslager 1 and Gemeinschaftslager 2 were also built during this time.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of <b>Technical</b> <b>Requirements</b> for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{principal}} photography {{was expected}} to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot-making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera’s location and other <b>technical</b> <b>requirements.</b> He used fibre material for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For {{a scene in which}} neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot, Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses. While the chariot race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the chariot sinks in quicksand was shot at a set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City.|$|E
5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' <b>technical</b> <b>requirements.</b> Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his admiration for The Curfew.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro's {{competition}} venues {{meet the}} International Federation's (IFs) <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> and both IOC and IPC standards, and align with the City Master Plan and legacy strategy. Most venues are already operational, recently developed or renovated. According to the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee, there are ten (29%) existing venues with no permanent works required and eight (24%) venues requiring reforms, while nine (26%) new permanent venues and seven (21%) temporary venues will be built. In total {{there will be}} 34 competition venues alongside 29 training venues, {{as part of the}} training venues strategy. The most significant legacy project from the bid is the Olympic Training Center (OTC) program and facilities with its headquarters located in Barra zone. Furthermore, the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee recognized the possibility of new sports being added to the Olympic Program and, following detailed analysis for each of the seven potential sports—baseball, golf, karate, roller sports, rugby, softball and squash—confirmed its capability to accommodate any of them in respect to venues, transport and other operational or logistical aspects. In addition, Rio de Janeiro and the four proposed cities to hold football (soccer) competitions—Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and São Paulo—were chosen to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Unlike, for example, the Market Portal of the Mainz Cathedral, the {{identity}} of the artist responsible for the Bernward Doors is not preserved.
