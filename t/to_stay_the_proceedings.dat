2500|$|One of {{the most}} recent (2009–10) public actions of The ICAI Disciplinary Committee was {{proceedings}} for professional misconduct against two auditors from the firm Price Waterhouse partners for wrongly auditing and inflating the financial statements of Satyam Computer Services Limited. The Supreme Court of India (November 2010) rejected a plea by the two charged auditors <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> by the ICAI Disciplinary committee. The court's order came in response to the pleas of the charged auditors seeking a stay on the disciplinary proceedings against [...] them on the ground that it violated their fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution of India.|$|E
2500|$|Instead, Salleh {{asked the}} Supreme Court <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{because of the}} tribunal's alleged {{improper}} constitution and because the King had been [...] "wrongfully advised". The Supreme Court, in an emergency session, unanimously ruled that the proceedings be stayed. Four days later, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong suspended the five Supreme Court judges who had issued the order, on Mahathir's advice. The government announced it would now attempt to impeach those five judges as well for [...] "gross misbehaviour" [...] and conspiring [...] "to make the order". There were now only four judges on the Supreme Court, two of them also sitting on the tribunal. The government appointed new judges to fill the void, who refused to hear any further motions by Salleh Abas. The tribunal eventually found Salleh guilty, and he was officially relieved of his position. Of the five judges who had supported him, two were convicted, {{and the other three}} were acquitted.|$|E

2500|$|Plaintiffs {{requested}} that the campaign produce internal documents {{that relate to the}} purpose and intent of the amendment and the development of political messages during the campaign. The Proposition 8 proponents objected to the request because of the potential chilling effect on political speech, among other grounds.

The proponents appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and separately moved <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the district court. Stating that the proponents were unlikely to succeed in this appeal, Walker rejected the stay request on October 23. Regardless, the proponents continued to assert a First Amendment privilege over these documents, a sampling of which Walker reviewed privately. On December 11, 2009, the Ninth Circuit overturned Walker's ruling, saying that the release of the documents [...] "would likely have a chilling effect on political association and the formulation of political expression" [...] in a unanimous opinion by Raymond C.

60|$|Paul Montague himself, who {{cannot be}} said to have been a man having his eyes open, in the city sense of the word, could not learn how the thing was progressing. At the regular {{meetings}} of the Board, which never sat for above half an hour, two or three papers were read by Miles Grendall. Melmotte himself would speak a few slow words, intended to be cheery, and always indicative of triumph, and then everybody would agree to everything, somebody would sign something, and the 'Board' for that day would be over. To Paul Montague this was very unsatisfactory. More than once or twice he endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> not as disapproving, but simply as desirous of being made to understand; but the silent scorn of his chairman put him out of countenance, and the opposition of his colleagues was a barrier which he was not strong enough to overcome. Lord Alfred Grendall would declare that he 'did not think all that was at all necessary.' Lord Nidderdale, with whom Montague had now become intimate at the Beargarden, would nudge him in the ribs and bid him hold his tongue. Mr Cohenlupe would make a little speech in fluent but broken English, assuring the Committee that everything was being done after the approved city fashion. Sir Felix, after the first two meetings, was never there. And thus Paul Montague, with a sorely burdened conscience, was carried along as one of the Directors of the Great South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway Company.|$|E

40|$|Relying on the {{analysis}} of judicial practice, in this paper the author discusses the two options that probate courts have at their disposal in the heirs of the diseased person (who is the maintenance recipient) decide to challenge the lifetime maintenance agreement {{in the course of}} probate <b>proceedings.</b> <b>The</b> first option, which is quite common in judicial practice, is <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> probate <b>proceedings</b> until <b>the</b> disputed issue is resolved before the competent (civil or administrative) authority. The author considers this practice to be inadequate because the fact that heirs challenge this agreement is not formally envisaged as the legal ground for <b>staying</b> <b>the</b> probate <b>proceedings.</b> In <b>the</b> author's opinion, regardless of whether the heirs challenge the lifetime maintenance agreement or not, the probate procedure should be terminated if the entire property of the deceased/maintenance recipient is disposed under this contract. If the contract does not cover the entire estate, the court should bring the decision to exclude those assets from the recipient's succession estate, and continue with <b>the</b> probate <b>proceedings.</b> In any case, the heirs are still entitled to file a civil claim in an attempt to prove that there are legal grounds for cancelling or nullifying the agreement...|$|R

50|$|In the case, Matthew Barraza and Tony Milner {{got married}} in Washington DC in 2010. They adopted a son in 2009, but under Utah law {{only one of the}} men could be the adoptive parent. In this case Matthew was {{recorded}} as the adoptive parent. The couple got a Utah marriage license and were married again on December 20, 2013. On December 26 they began legal proceedings so that Tony could also adopt their son. A hearing was scheduled for January 10.

Nevertheless, the registrar also asked for their marriage certificate. The office of the Attorney General instructed the registrar not to issue the new birth certificate. On April 7 the state Department of Health petitioned the Utah Supreme Court for a court order relieving the state of following the orders of federal Judge Kimball.

The conflict resulted in the death of many individuals as well as loss of property. The report indicates that the main reasons behind the conflict are pastures and water sources. Also, due to lack of efficient conflict resolution mechanisms to address the root causes of the conflict, members of both tribes frequently resorting to revenge. A conciliation conference was held on 2 nd of February 1981 which was facilitated by the Agaweed from both tribes in addition to religious leaders and representatives from some Ministries of Animal Resources, Pastures and some members form the National Parliament. The parties agreed to pay diya (blood money) as compensation to the aggrieved persons and families.

40|$|On October 22, 1998, Edwards {{and two of}} his {{business}} partners filed their original complaint. In the complaint, Edwards and his partners alleged they were fraudulently induced into leasing restaurant space and brought claims against eleven defendants. While counsel initially represented Edwards and his partners, the lawyer was forced to withdraw, after being disbarred. In his amended complaint, Edwards, who was not authorized to practice law, named, on their behalf, both business partners. In fact, Edwards named one partner who wished to be removed. The district court ruled that the amended complaint would relate solely to Edwards and removed the business partners from the caption. The court later determined that the earlier complaint remained effective as to the business partners. In March 2000, one of the defendants filed for federal bankruptcy protection. Thus, <b>the</b> automatic bankruptcy <b>stay</b> was commenced. One year later, in April 2001, the federal bankruptcy court entered an order granting the parties in Edwards’ action relief from <b>the</b> bankruptcy <b>stay.</b> In June 2001, even though <b>the</b> automatic <b>stay</b> had by that time been lifted, the district court acknowledged <b>the</b> <b>stay</b> and ordered <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> in Edwards’ action <b>stayed</b> until <b>the</b> bankruptcy court lifted <b>the</b> automatic <b>stay.</b> Edwards did not notify the district court that <b>the</b> automatic <b>stay</b> had been lifted until the court entered its own stay order. In April 2002, not aware of the true status of <b>the</b> bankruptcy <b>stay,</b> <b>the</b> district court entered an order refusing to consider any further pleadings until <b>the</b> bankruptcy <b>stay</b> was lifted. Later, realizing its error, the district court entered an order rescinding its previous stay orders.
