25|$|When he was 37, {{he married}} his 22-year-old backup singer and dancer Mayte Garcia, on Valentine's Day 1996. Mayte Garcia {{wrote in her}} memoir, The Most Beautiful: My Life with Prince that she was 16 when she first met Prince {{backstage}} at a concert in Germany after submitting a tape of her belly dancing. When Garcia turned 17 she moved to Prince's home, Paisley Park and he became her legal guardian. At 19, Prince <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to go on birth control and took her virginity just one week later. They had a son named Amiir Gregory Nelson on October 16, 1996; {{he was born with}} Pfeiffer syndrome and died a week later. In a later interview, she stated that she and Prince also lost a pregnancy early on to a miscarriage in late 1997. The couple eventually divorced in June 2000. Garcia said that all she wanted to take from the union was the urn with their son's ashes. She eventually learned from a friend that Prince had burned everything in their son's nursery, including the boy's crib and the urn with his ashes.|$|E
25|$|As part {{of their}} investigation, police served Verizon and AT with search {{warrants}} to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's Samsung Focus cell phone as evidence. According to Zahau's AT cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau talked and texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated {{that she wanted to}} stop by the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said she checked her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it was a message regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.|$|E
500|$|Julia Roberts was the [...] "one and only" [...] {{choice for}} the role of Anna Scott, {{although}} Roger Michell and Duncan Kenworthy did not expect her to accept.

Roberts said that after reading the script she decided she was [...] "going to have to do this".|$|E

I hope you have taken her in hand, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite another thing now, and her poor dear papa would think so. She must not let this {{opportunity}} pass, for she may never have another. Did you tell her so?' ...|$|R

60|$|Thorpe <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> {{in vain to}} {{go after}} the Tilneys; they were turning the corner into Brock Street, when he had {{overtaken}} them, and were at home by this time.|$|R
500|$|Peggy {{has been}} spoofed in several programmes, {{including}} the ITV cartoon sketch show 2DTV, and Harry Hill's TV Burp. In the BBC's Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona performs as Peggy, shuffling around {{on her knees}} to exaggerate Barbara Windsor's petite height, and regularly using the catchphrase [...] "Get outta my pub!" [...] Impressionist Jan Ravens has spoofed her in the BBC's Dead Ringers, also mimicking her cheeky laugh. Commenting on Ancona's impersonation, Windsor has said: [...] "she does me brilliantly. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great compliment. She made me realise my little hands wave around a lot." ...|$|E

In 1985, {{he won the}} four-in-hand carriage driving competition at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show. According to Sports Illustrated, Caspersen, described as [...] "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, {{with a lot of}} beef in his jowls" [...] recalled being asked by Queen Elizabeth II at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of Holsteiners: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to lower the carriage's center of gravity,... She looked at my midriff and said I was well suited for the job." ...|$|E
500|$|Jill begins {{an affair}} with wealthy Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and was {{convinced}} he would ask her to marry him, but he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a fling. Mortified, she quickly remarried John, much {{to the dismay of}} his children. Jill wanted another child, but John felt he was too old. She quickly got pregnant before he had a secret vasectomy. He wanted her to have an abortion but she didn't, and gave birth to Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). John and Jill continuously had arguments and she had {{an affair with}} Jed Sanders. Mamie found out and told John, ending the marriage. They had a bitter custody battle, but John suffered another stroke. Mamie confessed her love to John; Jill then paid her millions to leave town. John gained custody of Billy and left for New York. Later, Jill found a letter from Phillip Chancellor II which named her the sole owner of the Chancellor Estate; she evicted Katherine. Katherine found a legal loophole, allowing her to stay on the estate. Billy Abbott and Brock Reynold's teenage daughter MacKenzie Browning began a romance. [...] Jill had a brief romance with a young web designer, Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek). Katherine allowed ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick) to move in for housework, and Jill had an affair with him but kept it secret because of his social class. Katherine found out and confronted Jill, who denied it. Jill even insulted Larry, causing him to show up at a Jabot board meeting and expose the affair.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think he}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> against his {{principles}} {{to give to}} hospitals," [...] Lady Saxthorpe replied. [...] "He thinks {{that they should be}} supported out of the rates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite positive. I was, by accident, {{the first}} that Mrs. Menlove named the matter to, and I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> much to her {{advantage}} if she took particular care it should go no further.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1884, {{she married}} the artist Charles Walter Stetson after {{initially}} declining his proposal because {{a gut feeling}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not {{the right thing for}} her. Their only child, Katharine Beecher Stetson, was born the following year. Charlotte Perkins Gilman suffered a very serious bout of post-partum depression in the months after Katharine's birth. This was an age in which women were seen as [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "nervous" [...] beings; thus, when a woman claimed to be seriously ill after giving birth, her claims were sometimes dismissed as being invalid.|$|E
2500|$|Warhol cast Darling {{in a short}} comedic {{scene in}} Flesh (1968) with Jackie Curtis and Joe Dallesandro. After Flesh, Darling was cast in {{a central role in}} Women in Revolt (1971). She played a Long Island socialite, drawn into a woman's liberation group called PIGS (Politically Involved Girls), by a {{character}} played by Curtis. Interrupted by cast disputes encouraged by Warhol, Women in Revolt took longer to film than its predecessor and went through several title changes before it was released. Darling wanted it called Blonde on a Bum Trip since she was the blonde, while Curtis and Woodlawn <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more like [...] "Bum on a Blonde Trip", titles which were both used in the film during Darling's interview scene. For a short time, Darling worked as a barmaid at Slugger Ann's, the bar owned by Jackie Curtis's grandmother.|$|E
2500|$|The media later {{reported}} the frantic attempt by Rodger's parents to intervene {{on the evening}} of the killings. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. She checked his YouTube channel, where she found the [...] "Retribution" [...] video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She called Rodger's father regarding the disturbing video. He was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and they arranged to meet them upon arrival. Hearing a radio news report of a shooting in Isla Vista, his mother called the therapist, who <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unrelated, saying that Rodger promised to act the following day and it would be unlike him to deviate from such details. When they reached the police station in Isla Vista, they learned that the news report was, in fact, about their son, and that he had killed six people.|$|E

50|$|Sopocko was a {{professor}} of theology at the University of Vilnius and introduced Faustina to Kazimierowski, who was professor of art there. Kazimierowski had painted religious images before, but this task was difficult for him. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image, wearing an alb, and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter‘s workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Christ <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not that important that the picture be beautiful. The true beauty, Christ said, would be the blessing that He would bestow to the people by {{the means of the}} painting.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, {{she says}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a wicked thing, and {{forbidden}} by the Church. People {{who go to}} wish there, sacrifice to {{the spirits of the}} well; and Father Francis <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{statuette}} of a god named Osiris and very, very ancient, probably quite {{five thousand}} years old, a statement at which she smiled a little; also {{that it came}} from Egypt.|$|R

60|$|Mary {{did take}} the letter, and she opened it, though with {{trembling}} hands. The inclosure soon appeared, {{and the first}} glance of her eye <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a letter addressed to herself.|$|E

60|$|Maggie did {{not know}} how clever she had been; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite enough that Tom called her Magsie, and was pleased with her. There was nothing to mar her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened to the light dipping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle rustling, as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also. Maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way, and never be scolded. She never knew she had a bite until Tom <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true, but she liked fishing very much.|$|R
6000|$|She {{immediately}} {{demanded to}} know what a [...] "boodwar" [...] was. The shopman <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an elegant apartment in which young ladies were wont to sit and read poetry, and think of their absent lovers.|$|R

60|$|The {{existing}} Prayer-book {{had been}} made expressly to forbid lay baptism and baptism by women, at the special desire of the reformers, and Sir Amias was proportionately horrified, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an offence for the Archbishop's court.|$|E
