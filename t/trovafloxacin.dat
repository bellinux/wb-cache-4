5000|$|The Kano <b>trovafloxacin</b> trial {{litigation}} arose out of {{a clinical}} trial conducted by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer in 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, during an epidemic of meningococcal meningitis. To test its new antibiotic, <b>trovafloxacin</b> (Trovan), Pfizer gave 100 children <b>trovafloxacin,</b> while another 100 received the gold-standard anti-meningitis treatment, ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic. Pfizer gave the children a substantially reduced dose of the ceftriaxone (specifically, 33mg/kg) relative to that described on the US FDA approved Prescribing Information. The allegation {{is that this was}} done to skew the test in favor of its own drug. Pfizer claimed that the dose used was sufficient even though a clinical trial performed by Médecins Sans Frontières recommends a dose of 50 - 100mg/kg. A 2002 report by the World Bank described the military government that ruled Nigeria at the time of these events as [...] "pervasively corrupt". It further cites widespread comments by business managers in Nigeria characterizing the NAFDAC of that period as lacking the capabilities needed to perform its regulatory role and [...] "harassing business and seeking bribes" [...] rather than [...] "protecting businesses and consumers".|$|E

50|$|In 1996, {{during a}} {{meningitis}} epidemic in Kano, Nigeria, {{the drug was}} administered to approximately 200 infected children. Eleven children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, common sequalae of meningitis {{that have not been}} seen in patients treated with <b>trovafloxacin</b> for other infection types. An investigation by the Washington Post concluded that Pfizer had administered the drug as part of an illegal clinical trial without authorization from the Nigerian government or consent from the children's parents. The case came to light in December 2000 as the result of an investigation by The Washington Post, and sparked significant public outcry. The most serious error was the falsification and backdating of an ethics approval letter by the lead investigator of the trial, Dr. Abdulhamid Isa Dutse. Dr. Dutse is now the chief medical officer of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. The result of the trial was that children treated with oral <b>trovafloxacin</b> had a 5% (5/100) mortality rate compared to a 6% (6/100) mortality rate with intramuscular ceftriaxone.|$|E

The story described the slow death of the girl while researchers, who were testing Pfizer’s antibiotic Trovan (<b>trovafloxacin),</b> monitored her dying without modifying her treatment. The Post also alleged other such corporation-sponsored experiments “in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America” that were “poorly regulated,” “dominated by private interests” and “far too often betray” their promises to research subjects and consumers.

5000|$|In the mid-1990s, Pfizer {{developed}} <b>Trovafloxacin</b> Mesylate, {{an antibiotic}} {{that is also}} known by its brand name as “Trovan.” Pfizer projected that its total annual sales could exceed $ 1 billion a year. (Compl. P 96.) Beginning in 1996, Pfizer conducted the largest drug testing program ever undertaken by enrolling thousands of participants in clinical tests. (Compl. P 97.) However, prior animal testing indicated that Trovan might cause significant side effects in children such as joint disease, abnormal cartilage growth (osteochondrosis, a disease resulting in bone deformation) and liver damage. (Compl. PP 98-99.)In 1996, epidemics of bacterial meningitis, measles and cholera besieged the impoverished Nigerian city of Kano. (Compl. PP 2, 5, 101.) In April 1996, six weeks after it first learned of the epidemics, Pfizer dispatched a medical team to establish a treatment center at Kano's Infectious Disease Hospital (“IDH”). (Compl. PP 2, 8, 101-02, 101-07, 109.)In addition to Pfizer team, humanitarian organizations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres ("MSF"), also known as Doctors Without Borders, traveled to Kano’s IDH to treat the sick. (Compl. P 5.) The medical teams operated under squalid conditions in a hospital consisting of several single story cinder block buildings, some of which lacked electricity and running water. (Compl. P 110.) The beds were filled to capacity and patients seeking care overflowed on to the hospital's grounds. (Compl. P 110.) Plaintiffs allege that while MSF and other organizations offered safe and effective treatments for bacterial meningitis, Pfizer embarked on a medical experiment involving the “new, untested and unproven” antibiotic “Trovan.” (Compl. PP 2-3, 6, 8, 95.)To travel to Kano, Pfizer needed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) authorization to export Trovan. On 15 March 1996, Pfizer informed the FDA of its intent to conduct the Kano study. (Compl. P 108.) Thereafter, Pfizer obtained a 20 March letter from the Nigerian government and a 28 March letter from IDH’s ethics committee permitting Pfizer to export Trovan to Kano. (Compl. P 108.) Although both letters predate Pfizer’s departure for Kano, plaintiffs allege that no IDH ethics committee existed as of 28 March 1996 and that the 28 March letter was back-dated {{in response to a}} 1997 FDA audit. (Compl. PP 132-33.) Pfizer,Plaintiffs further contend that Pfizer’s sole purpose for traveling to Kano was to expedite the FDA's approval of Trovan to treat pediatric victims. (Compl. P 7.) Prior to Kano, only one child had ever been treated with Trovan, and then only after all other antibiotics failed. No child had ever received it orally. (Compl. P 105-06.) According to plaintiffs, Nigerian officials allocated to Pfizer two of IDH’s wards to conduct the testing. (Compl. P 113.) Pfizer selected, from lines of those awaiting treatment, children ranging in age from one to thirteen years who exhibited symptoms of neck stiffness, joint stiffness, and high fevers with headaches. (Compl. P 3, 115.) Pfizer divided them into two groups and treated half with Trovan. (Compl. P 3.) The other half was “purposefully ‘low-dosed’” with ceftriaxone, an FDA-approved drug shown to be effective in treating meningitis. (Compl. P 125.) In order to enhance the comparative results of Trovan, Pfizer administered only one-third of ceftriaxone's recommended dosage. (Compl. P 3, 124-25.)Meanwhile, MSF established their headquarters in tents beside the IDH due to space constraints. (Compl. P 111.) There, MSF admitted their sickest patients to hospital beds in the IDH and confined the less ill to floor mats in their tents. (Compl. P 112.) MSF treated pediatric meningitis patients with chloramphenicol, a drug recommended by the World Health Organization to treat bacterial meningitis in epidemic situations. (Compl. PP 11, 111.)Pfizer’s protocol also called for the children selected to have their blood tested on arrival and five days later. (Compl. P 126.) If a child was not responding well to Trovan, Pfizer switched his or her treatment to ceftriaxone. (Compl. P 126.) Plaintiffs allege, however, that Pfizer neglected to analyze the patients’ blood samples and therefore could not determine if a patient had a negative reaction until the manifestation of a visible and permanent injury. (Compl. P 126.) Plaintiffs further allege that low-dosing ceftriaxone resulted in injuries and deaths among the control group. (Compl. P 3.)Although Pfizer’s protocol called for its team to obtain consent from the parents of the children treated who were too young to sign, few parents could speak or read English. (Compl. P 127.) Plaintiffs claim that Pfizer failed to explain to the children’s parents that the proposed treatment was experimental, that they could refuse it, or that other organizations offered more conventional treatments at the same site free of charge. (Compl. PP 3, 117-20, 128-30, 154-55, 157.) After two weeks, the Pfizer team left Kano and never returned for follow-up evaluations. (Compl. P 122.) Plaintiffs allege that five children who received Trovan and six children whom Pfizer “low-dosed” died. (Compl. P 120.) Others suffered paralysis, deafness and blindness. (Compl. PP 16-50.)On 30 December 1996, Pfizer applied with the FDA for approval to market Trovan in the United States for various uses including the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases. (Compl. P 216.) In June 1997, FDA inspectors discovered inconsistencies in the data resulting from Pfizer’s Kano treatments. (Compl. P 217.) Thereafter, regulators informed Pfizer that they planned to deny its application to use the drug against epidemic meningitis and expressed several concerns including Pfizer's failure to conduct follow-up examinations. In response, Pfizer withdrew its application. (Compl. P 217.)On 18 February 1998, Pfizer launched Trovan after it received FDA authorization for treatment of a number of adult illnesses. (Compl. P 218.) Shortly thereafter, Pfizer and the FDA received reports regarding Trovan patients suffering liver damage. (Compl. P 219.)In January 1999, the FDA recommended that Trovan be prescribed only for patients in nursing homes or hospitals suffering from life-threatening conditions. (Compl. P 223.) That following June, the FDA issued a public health advisory on liver toxicity associated with oral and intravenous Trovan following post-marketing reports of acute liver failure strongly associated with the drug. (Compl. P 224.) The FDA announced that it received reports of more than 100 cases where Trovan patients exhibited clinically symptomatic liver toxicity and advised physicians to use Trovan only for patients who met certain criteria. (Compl. P 224-25.) In addition, Pfizer agreed to limit distribution of Trovan to hospitals and long term nursing facilities. (Compl. P 224.) Further, the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products suspended all sales of Trovan in part due to results from the Kano tests. (Compl. PP 221-22.) ...|$|E

MethodsIn this open, randomized, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers (six females, six males; mean age ± SD, 25. 1 ± 2. 6 years) received an infusion of either 300 mg of alatrovafloxacin or 2000 mg of cefepime or 6 mg/kg body weight amikacin alone, or 300 mg of alatrovafloxacin plus 2000 mg of cefepime or plus 6 mg/kg body weight amikacin. The SBAs against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus (11 strains each), Citrobacter freundii and Acinetobacter spp. (10 strains each) 1, 10 and 24 h after drug administration were measured by a standard microdilution method. Concentrations of <b>trovafloxacin,</b> cefepime and amikacin in serum and urine were analyzed before and up to 10 and 12 h, respectively, after drug infusion. ResultsSignificant synergistic effects on SBA were observed with the combination of <b>trovafloxacin</b> and cefepime against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Acinetobacter spp. 1 h after drug administration, and against Citrobacter freundii 1, 10 and 24 h after drug administration. The combination of <b>trovafloxacin</b> and amikacin showed significant synergistic effects against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and C. freundii 1 h after drug administration. The combination of <b>trovafloxacin</b> and cefepime was, in general, more active than the combination of <b>trovafloxacin</b> and amikacin.
