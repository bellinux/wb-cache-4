40|$|The {{occurrence}} of two generations (D 1 /D 2) of folds and cleavage, compatible {{with a top}} to the north-north-west sense of shear during Variscan convergence is confirmed. A subsequent change in the stress regime (sigma(1) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> vertical, sigma(3) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> north-north-west-south-south-east) brought about the extensional reactivation of convergence-related features. The resultant D 3 structures are diverse and include zones of distributed shear within the footwall of the Carrick Thrust, together with detachments and high angle brittle extensional faults within the hangingwall. D 3 deformation probably initiated during the Stephanian, prior to lamprophyre intrusion, but persisted into the early Permian and was partially synchronous with granite emplacement and high temperature mineralization. Changes in the stress regime during the Permian (sigma(1) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> east-north-east-west-south-west, sigma(3) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> north-north-west-south-south-east <b>to</b> sigma(1) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> north-north-west-south-south-east, sigma(3) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> east-north-east-west-south-west) resulted in strike-slip faulting {{and the formation of}} steeply dipping cleavages.

In the 1201 compound the ordered superstructure {{can be described as}} O-I (a(I) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> 2 a(p), b(I), <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> a(p), c(I) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> c(1201)).

In some compounds, such as Hg 0. 4 Pr 0. 6 Sr 2 (Ca 0. 4 Sr 0. 4 Pr 0. 2) Cu 2 O 6 +delta, the Hg-Pr ordering is only present in microdomains, but due to an ordering between Sr layers and Ca layers, the c-axis doubles and one obtains a tetragonal superstructure T-III (a(III) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> a(p), c(III) <b>approximate</b> <b>to</b> 2 c(1212)). In the 1222 compound, ordering in the (Pr,Hg) O-delta plane is very defective; a large number of translation defects actually reduce the symmetry to triclinic. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
