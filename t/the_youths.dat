5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements in which <b>the</b> <b>youths</b> reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period.
