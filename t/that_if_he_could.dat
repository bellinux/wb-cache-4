5|$|Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{at the end}} of 1932 and the {{beginning}} of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated that he spent most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Emperor's palace, Faythe {{decides that}} she must see Gabriel again. Disguising herself, she begins to travel back to Ravenskill. Arabelle, knowing about her daughter's intentions, instructs Daryus to follow and protect her. Daryus feels {{he has always been}} {{overlooked}} by his father in favor of his sister, so he travels to the town with his own intentions ("A Life Left Behind"). Faythe arrives in the town and finds Xander, who trusts her and leads her to his father Arhys. Faythe convinces Arhys that she can help, so he brings her to Gabriel's hideout. Gabriel and Faythe embrace, and she tells him that she believes she can convince her father to give up his hunt for Gabriel ("Ravenskill"). Gabriel tells her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> just meet with the Emperor, he could inspire him to restore peace to the land using his gift of music ("Chosen").|$|E
25|$|The murder {{appears to}} have been {{motivated}} by Phillips's fear of his abusive and alcoholic father, who would have been very angry had he found Maddie inside their house. Phillips stated on the TV program Too Young to Kill: 15 Shocking Crimes <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take it back, he would, subsequently breaking down into tears.|$|E
60|$|And he had {{the clearest}} {{conviction}} in his mind <b>that</b> <b>if</b> now <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be put back again to the day before that lunch....|$|R

25|$|Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, {{offered to}} sell the patent {{outright}} to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone {{was nothing but a}} toy. Two years later, he told colleagues <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get the patent for $25million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{seizing the}} throne, Amanullah had his uncle Nasrullah arrested for Habibullah's murder {{and had him}} sentenced to life imprisonment. Nasrullah had been {{the leader of a}} more {{conservative}} element in Afghanistan and his treatment rendered Amanullah's position as Amir somewhat tenuous. By April 1919 he realised <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not find a way to placate the conservatives he would be unlikely to maintain his hold on power. Looking for a diversion from the internal strife in the Afghan court and sensing advantage in the rising civil unrest in India following the Amritsar massacre, Amanullah decided to invade British India.|$|E
25|$|Helene was a pious, quiet young woman, {{and she and}} Franz Joseph felt ill at ease in each other's company, but he was {{instantly}} infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but defied his mother and informed her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in Vienna at the Augustinerkirche on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a dower equal to today's 240,000 USD.|$|E

60|$|Vane stood silent {{a minute}} or two, for the last appeal had stirred him to chivalrous pity. He was shrewd enough to realise <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> persisted <b>he</b> <b>could</b> force {{her to come to}} him. Her father and mother were with him; she had nothing--no common-place {{usefulness}} or trained abilities--to fall back upon if she defied them. But it was unthinkable that he should brutally compel her.|$|R
25|$|Murray {{resisted}} the second demand: <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor {{to work in}} parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray {{did not want to}} share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That {{turned out not to be}} so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{grew up in}} East Lansing, Michigan. In youth hockey, Miller {{originally}} {{played as}} a forward. However, Miller became frustrated with the poor play of his team's goaltender, so he begged his coach {{as well as his}} father, Dean Miller, to let him try it out. His father told him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get two goals and three assists the next game he would buy Ryan a catching glove. Miller finished the game with two goals and three assists in the win. His brother Drew is currently a free agent and three cousins (Kelly Miller, Kip Miller and Kevin Miller) all played in the NHL. All five attended Michigan State University, where Ryan Miller played goalie for three years.|$|E
25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hold out for a little while longer the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E
50|$|However {{given the}} {{majority}} that Fianna Fáil enjoyed within the government, Murphy realised <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> force {{a vote on}} the budget he would inevitably lose and so further debate on the issue would serve little purpose but to waste time.|$|R

25|$|Tamil United Liberation Front leader Appapillai Amirthalingam, {{who was in}} 1977 {{elected as}} the Opposition leader of Sri Lanka Parliament, clandestinely {{supported}} the LTTE. Amirthalingam believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> exercise control over the Tamil insurgent groups, it would enhance his political position and pressure the government to agree to grant political autonomy to Tamils. Thus, he provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Both Uma Maheswaran (a former surveyor) and Urmila Kandiah, first female member of the LTTE, were prominent members of the TULF youth wing. Maheswaran was the secretary of TULF Tamil Youth Forum, Colombo branch. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N. S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE, which split {{for the first time}} in 1979. Uma Maheswaran was found to be having a love affair with Urmila Kandiah, which was against the code of conduct of LTTE. Prabhakaran ordered him to leave the organisation. Uma Maheswaran left LTTE and formed People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Captain J. Cass Mason of St. Louis, Sultana left St. Louis on April 13, 1865, bound for New Orleans, Louisiana. On the morning of April 15, she was tied up at Cairo, Illinois when word reached the city that President Abraham Lincoln had been shot at Ford's Theater. Immediately, Captain Mason grabbed an armload of Cairo {{newspapers}} and headed south to spread the news, knowing that telegraphic communication with the South had been almost totally cut off because of the war. Upon reaching Vicksburg, Mississippi, Mason was approached by Lt. Col. Reuben Hatch, the chief quartermaster at Vicksburg. Hatch had a deal for Mason. Thousands of recently released Union prisoners of war that had been held by the Confederacy at the prison camps of Cahaba near Selma, Alabama, and Andersonville, in southwest Georgia, {{had been brought to}} a small parole camp outside of Vicksburg to await release to the North. The U.S. government would pay $5 per enlisted man and $10 per officer to any steamboat captain who would take a group north. Knowing that Mason was in need of money, Hatch suggested <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> guarantee Mason a full load of about 1,400 prisoners, Mason would guarantee to give Hatch a kickback. Hoping to gain much money through this deal, Mason quickly agreed to the offered bribe.|$|E
500|$|By now Archduke Charles clearly {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> unite with Wartenbsleben, he could pick off both the French armies in succession. [...] Having sufficient reinforcements, and having transferred his supply line from Vienna to Bohemia, {{he planned to}} move north to unite with Wartensleben: if the stubborn old man would not come to him, the young archduke {{would go to the}} stubborn old man. With 25,000 of his best troops, Charles crossed to the north bank of the Danube at Regensburg.|$|E

500|$|Once in the studio, {{however, the}} team had no clear {{direction}} for the album as there were no concepts being discussed. Aside from having [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] to draw from, they had no [...] "game plan" [...] and no working title for the new album. Timberlake thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make a record that would live up to Justified, he [...] "would have".

[...] With both fastball and changeup being plus-plus pitches and improved command, Baseball Prospectus and Baseball Prospect Nation conclude his likely future is as a solid number-three starter. [...] However, as command of his curve has markedly improved, so have his projections. [...] The same initial reports stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> enhance his slider's reliability, he may be able to become a low-end number two starter.

500|$|A {{day before}} the coup Wahad, {{who claimed to have}} {{information}} from the Egyptian intelligence service, warned al-Badr that Sallal and fifteen other officers, including Moghny, were planning a revolution. Wahad's purpose was to cover himself and Egypt in case the coup failed, to prompt the plotters into immediate action, and drive Sallal and Moghny into a single conspiracy. Sallal got imamic permission to bring in the armed forces. [...] Then, Wahad went to Moghny, and told him that al-Badr had somehow discovered the plot, and that he must act immediately before the other officers would be arrested. He told him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hold San'a, the radio and the airport for three days, the whole of Europe would recognize him.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{recognized}} {{the change in}} the direction of the Soviet leadership with Mikhail Gorbachev, and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements. Reagan's personal mission was to achieve [...] "a world free of nuclear weapons," [...] which he regarded as [...] "totally irrational, totally inhumane, good for nothing but killing, possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization." [...] He was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with General Secretary Gorbachev. Gorbachev and Reagan held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988: the first in Geneva, Switzerland, the second in Reykjavík, Iceland, the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in Moscow. Reagan believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of Communism.|$|E

Robert experimented, believing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> jump higher <b>if</b> the zinc from a battery could be charged by scuffing {{his feet on the}} gravel walk.
