5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around half of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> pregnant unintentionally are using birth {{control at the}} time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E

25|$|A {{safe and}} {{effective}} vaccine against yellow fever exists and some countries require vaccinations for travelers. Other efforts to prevent infection include reducing {{the population of the}} transmitting mosquito. In areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon, early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population is important to prevent outbreaks. Once infected, management is symptomatic with no specific measures effective against the virus. Death occurs in up to half of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> severe disease.|$|E

25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to have a heart attack, {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E

500|$|Hepatitis B is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> infected {{around the time of}} birth 90% develop chronic [...] while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.|$|E
500|$|Aspects of the Movementarians were {{inspired}} by different cults and religions, including Scientology, Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple, the Heaven's Gate group, the Unification Church, the Oneida Society, and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. In particular, the leader driving through the fields in a Rolls Royce was partly inspired by the Bhagwans, {{and the notion of}} holding people inside the camp against their will was a reference to Jim Jones. The name [...] "Movementarians" [...] itself was simply chosen for its awkward sound. The scene during the six-hour orientation video where <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> up to leave are induced to stay through peer pressure and groupthink was a reference to the Unification Church and EST Training. The show's producers acknowledged that the ending scene of the episode was a poke at Fox as [...] "being the evil mind controlling network". The episode's script was written in 1997, at roughly {{the same time that the}} members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed mass suicide. The writers noticed strange parallels between Mirkin's first draft and Heaven's Gate, including the belief in the arrival of a spaceship and the group's members wearing matching clothes and odd sneakers. Because of these coincidences, several elements of the episode were changed so that it would be more sensitive in the wake of the suicides.|$|E

The Ulster Vanguard movement was originally a political pressure group within the UUP.

Pope himself {{was one of the}} earliest poets to make his living solely by writing, and so it is not the professional author, but the mercenary author that Pope derides. He attacks hired pens, the authors who perform poetry or religious writing for the greatest pay alone, who do not believe in what they are doing. As he puts it in book II, [...] "He (a patron) chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state... And (among the poets) instant, fancy feels th' imputed sense" [...] (II 189–91). He objects not to professional writers, but to hackney writers.
