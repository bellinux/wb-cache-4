Six years later he declined re-election, but the General Assembly elected him anyway, only to have him resign. He served from March 4, 1829 until December 29, 1836. He distinguished himself in the Senate by a speech during the debate on the Foote resolution, which, though merely relating to the survey of the public lands, introduced into the discussion <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>question</b> of nullification. Clayton favored the extension of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States and his investigation of the Post Office Department led to its reorganization. At various times he served on the Military Affairs, Militia, District of Columbia and Post Office Committees, but his most important position was the Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee in the 23rd and 24th Congress.|$|E

[...] Once on the ground he found a shaken army conducting a hesitant withdrawal, and in urgent need of delaying tactics to slow the German advance.

The plan, which involved Victor Jones creating a strong fictional force of 300 tanks on the British right hand flank, {{was in full swing}} during February. The operation appears to have had limited effect. Rommel delayed his advance until May, when British forces were routed at the Battle of Gazala and the Germans resumed their push toward Egypt.|$|E

Two months later, a sketch design was presented for consideration, {{but it was not}} well liked by the participants. This design retained all three main gun turrets and the flight deck was deemed too short to be useful.

The hybrid's armament consisted of six 16-inch guns in two triple turrets, sixteen 5.25-inch guns and eight octuple 2-pounder mounts. Twelve fighters and two torpedo bombers could be carried. The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design, [...] "The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ...the conceptions of these designs ...is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ...these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment. The necessary readjustments should result from a proper re-analysis of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>question,</b> what would be a balanced fleet in 1945, 1950 or 1955?"

In addition, the knowledge in these repositories might not be comprehensive or up-to-date due to several reasons, such as the discovery of new knowledge in the eld after the repositories were created. In this paper, we present SemanticQA system that allows users to query semantic data repositories using natural language questions.
