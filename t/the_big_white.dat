25|$|The {{success of}} Big White Fog in Chicago {{prompted}} Ward to seek wider reaching theatrical success in New York City. He traveled east {{as an actor}} in the chorus of the FTP's 1939 production of The Swing Mikado, and settled in with Wright in Harlem where he was writing for the Communist newspaper, the Daily Worker. Without warning, however, Congress announced that they were shutting down the increasingly incendiary productions of the Federal Theatre Project, and Ward promptly found himself out of a job. Determined to continue his theatrical experiments and bolstered by Wright's socialist agenda, Ward began searching for private funding and a New York venue to revive <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog. After a series of fundraisers and new alliances with New York artists, the play re-opened Off-Broadway in 1940 at Harlem's Lincoln Theatre as the inaugural production of Ward's new collaborative project, the Negro Playwrights Company, a theatrical organization born out of the burgeoning culture of the Harlem Renaissance and featuring such up-and-comers as Wright, Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Powell Lindsay, and Edna Thomas among others. Although both critics and Ward's contemporaries celebrated the work for its somber realism and politically relevant tone, the general public disapproved of its heavy-handed leftist rhetoric and, as a result, Big White Fog closed after only sixty-four performances, taking the still fledgling Negro Playwrights Company down in its wake.|$|E
500|$|In an Astaire-Rogers picture, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Set — {{as these}} Art Deco-inspired creations were known — {{took up the}} largest share of the film's {{production}} costs, and Top Hat was no exception. A winding canal — spanned by two staircase bridges {{at one end and}} a flat bridge on the other — was built across two adjoining sound stages. Astaire and Rogers dance across this flat bridge in [...] "Cheek to Cheek". Around the bend from this bridge was located the main piazza, a giant stage coated in red bakelite and this was the location for [...] "The Piccolino". This fantasy representation of the Lido of Venice was on three levels comprising dance floors, restaurants and terraces, all decorated in candy-cane colours, with the canal waters [...] dyed black. The vast Venetian interiors were similarly inauthentic, reflecting instead the latest Hollywood tastes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Matchstick Men, the protagonist (Nicolas Cage) is a {{neurotic}} con artist with Tourette's and obsessive compulsive disorder. [...] Other examples are <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>White,</b> The Boondock Saints, Curb Your Enthusiasm, , Maze, Niagara, Niagara, Not Another Teen Movie, Phoebe in Wonderland, Son of the Sunshine, Wedding Crashers, The Wedding Singer, The West Wing and What About Bob. The British comedic drama Shameless features Marty Fisher, a character with Tourette syndrome {{who is an}} arsonist.|$|E

2500|$|At least 3,500 people {{demonstrated}} against Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg, {{under heavy}} police presence, but no arrests were made. In Moscow on Sunday 26 February up to 30,000 people lined the Garden Ring in a protest called <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Circle. White clothes and white ribbons were worn as protestors formed a nine-mile human chain holding a white banner. The event {{was described as}} an apolitical [...] "act of unity" [...] to avoid the official permission which protests require.|$|E

5000|$|Fowler {{started his}} career in 1954 at the London office of Ove Arup and Partner. In 1957 he {{returned}} to New Zealand where he worked in his own practice: Calder, Fowler, Styles and Turner in Wellington. In the early 1960s, Fowler designed Wellington's Overseas Passenger Terminal, which was to have served international passenger ships, but never saw its intended use due to the rising popularity of air travel. In an interview many years later, {{he said that he}} [...] "was party to the design of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>white</b> elephant that Wellington ever built." ...|$|R

60|$|Jack liked that; {{it was a}} gentlemanly way {{of doing}} things, and he showed his {{satisfaction}} by smiling all over his face, and giving <b>the</b> <b>big,</b> <b>white</b> hand a hearty shake with both his rough ones.|$|E

50|$|George was {{the highest-ranking}} CIA {{official}} {{to stand trial}} over <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>White</b> House scandal since Watergate: a White House-led operation to covertly sell weapons to Iran and divert the profits to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras. The operation had been engineered out of the White House by Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, {{who served on the}} National Security Council staff. North was then aided by CIA Director William Casey. Aspects of the operation violated a congressionally-mandated restriction of overt U.S. support of the Contras. George initially told Congress that CIA was not involved in the operation, and he later apologized for being evasive. He said he was trying to protect the agency.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And how is Mr. Underwood?' asked Mrs. Froggatt, when Robina {{had been}} {{divested}} of her wraps, placed {{close to the}} fire, screened and footstooled, and when Lance had transferred <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> cat from the arm-chair to his own knee.|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} laughed, {{and held}} out her hand to him, and in a few more minutes Desmond was striding down the hot street towards the beach. When he reached the boat he turned a moment and looked back towards <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> house.|$|E

5000|$|The ransom of {{approximately}} US$3 million was {{invested in the}} trucks with which the 'Ndrangheta won all the transportation contracts for the container port of Gioia Tauro.

60|$|At 10:30 o'clock old man Ballinger {{came out}} of his house in his {{stocking}} feet and leaned over the gate, smoking his pipe. He looked down <b>the</b> <b>big</b> road, <b>white</b> in <b>the</b> moonshine, and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot. It was time for the Fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road.|$|R

60|$|The {{other girls}} went on, leaving Rachel {{sitting on the}} skids, {{in the shadow of}} <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> boat. She sat there for a time dreaming happily, with her blue eyes on the far, pearly horizon, and her golden head leaning against the boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon as I stopped I {{was ashamed}} of myself--as well I might {{be in front of}} privates--and went back and started again. Off I jumped this time--with a kind of sob, I remember--clean into the air, with <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> sail bellying out above me.|$|E

5000|$|Owner Angela Westwater {{once said}} of <b>the</b> gallery, “a <b>big</b> <b>white</b> box, we’re not.” [...] With its {{innovative}} division {{of space and}} use of material, the Sperone Westwater Gallery differentiates itself from the typical Chelsea galleries of large open spaces surrounded by white walls.|$|R
50|$|The highest {{summit in}} <b>the</b> Highland is <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Mountain, at its northeastern extremity, {{which is also}} the highest summit of the Beaverdell Range, a {{mountain}} range which extends south from <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> between <b>the</b> Kettle and West Kettle Rivers. Other notable summits are Okanagan Mountain, Little White Mountain, Mount Baldy, Mount Hull, and Mount Bonaparte which is the highest summit in the US portion of the Highland.|$|R
60|$|Macallister's {{mood was}} {{sometimes}} freakish and his humour rude, but behind {{this was a}} stern, honest efficiency. The quartermaster was a mystic, but when <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> combers chased the cargo launch one could trust him with the steering oar. After all to know one's job was much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Them also I know," [...] said Mary eagerly, for she {{was glad}} her father should find her so well acquainted with the field flowers; [...] "there is nothing prettier than <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> flowers of the cockle-shells.

60|$|Then {{the ropes}} were cast off, {{and he sat}} down to open his letter under the deckhouse, as with a sonorous blast of her whistle <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> steamer swung out from the wharf.

25|$|The waters {{surrounding}} Scotland {{are some}} of the richest in Europe. Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of the North East of Scotland and along the west coast, with important fish markets in places such as Aberdeen and Mallaig. Fish and shellfish such as herring, crab, lobster, haddock and cod are landed at ports such as Peterhead, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>white</b> fish port in Europe, Fraserburgh, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> shellfish port in Europe, Stornoway, Lerwick and Oban. There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Scotland, due initially to the sacrifice of national fishing rights to the EEC on the UK's accession to the Common Market in the 1970s, and latterly to the historically low abundances of commercially valuable fish in the North Sea and parts of the North Atlantic. To rebuild stocks the EU's Common Fisheries Policy places restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed, on the days at sea allowed and on fishing gear that can be deployed. These measures have so far been unsuccessful.|$|R

5000|$|On 31 March 1806 Napoleon withdrew Massa and Carrara {{from the}} Kingdom of Italy {{to add to}} Élisa's possessions. Carrara was one of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>white</b> marble {{suppliers}} in Europe and Élisa bolstered her prestige by establishing an Académie des Beaux-Arts, designed to host the greatest sculptors and thus make Carrara an exporter of marble statues, which had a greater value than the raw marble. She also set up the Banque Élisienne to give financial aid to sculptors and workers on marble taxes. She reformed the clergy at Lucca and Piombino from May 1806, during which reforms she nationalised their goods and lands and closed down convents which did not also function as hotels or schools. She also carried out legislative reform in Lucca, producing laws inspired by the Code Napoleon (such as the notable [...] "Codice rurale del Principato di Piombino", issued on 24 March 1808) and producing a new penal code which was promulgated in 1807 and first reformed in 1810.|$|R
