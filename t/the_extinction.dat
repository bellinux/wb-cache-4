5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have {{happened}} around 1000 years ago, when <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> {{of the rest of}} the subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. <b>The</b> <b>extinction</b> of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by <b>the</b> <b>extinction.</b> Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by <b>the</b> <b>extinction.</b> The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E

5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. <b>The</b> <b>extinction</b> of a species results in <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
5|$|The K-T {{boundary}} {{is associated}} with abnormally high amounts of iridium, an element which is rare in Earth's crust, but relatively common in asteroids and in Earth's core. This {{has been used as}} evidence that a meteorite impact caused <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> of the dinosaurs (the Alvarez hypothesis). However, some paleontologists attribute <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> event and the iridium anomaly to more gradual climatic change caused by the volcanic activity of the Deccan Traps. The Nanxiong Basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains the K-T boundary. However, the position of boundary, as well as the duration of <b>the</b> <b>extinction</b> have been subject to debate. Zhao et al. (2002 and 2009) have postulated that there were at least two iridium-delivering events over a time period consistent with the Deccan Traps volcanism, correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from the Nanxiong Basin. According to their interpretation, Macroolithus survived 250,000 years into the early Paleocene. However, Buck et al. (2004) disputed these claims, arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked the sediments near the boundary, causing a blurring of the iridium anomaly and the appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides.|$|E
