According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou <b>tried,</b> <b>unsuccessfully,</b> to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-General William Birdwood, {{commanding}} the inexperienced Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), comprising the Australian Division and two brigades of the New Zealand and Australian Division, {{was ordered to}} conduct an amphibious assault {{on the western side}} of the Gallipoli Peninsula.

To bring the division up to strength, Hamilton had <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> to get a brigade of Gurkhas attached to them. In total ANZAC strength was 30,638 men.|$|E
5|$|Midas is a verse {{drama in}} blank verse by the Romantic writers Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary wrote the drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems to it.

Koszul's 1922 scholarly edition. Whether or not the drama was ever meant to be staged {{is a point of}} debate among scholars. The play combines the stories of the musical contest between Apollo and Pan and that of King Midas and his ability to turn everything he touches to gold.|$|E
