Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang – just the way she was."

This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E

500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E

Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} gained a {{significant}} amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for Vibe, Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him [...] "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked [...] "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, [...] "No". In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, [...] "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body {{in a way that makes}} you know that this is your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said [...] "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> there and endure." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video. She continued, recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed, stating: ...|$|E

The album was recorded with no particular concept in mind, and the theme [...] "came after the fact," [...] according to Lamson. After recording, the group [...] " [...] had all this time <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> on what we had done," [...] and they found the songs happened to come out {{as an expression of}} being grateful. [...] "Like I don't care how bad your life is, there's always something around you to be grateful for," [...] said Guarisco in 2011.

2500|$|Rajneesh {{developed}} other active meditation techniques, {{such as the}} Kundalini [...] "shaking" [...] {{meditation and}} the Nadabrahma [...] "humming" [...] meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity {{of one sort or}} another. His later [...] "meditative therapies" [...] require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation. These processes of [...] "witnessing" [...] enable a [...] "jump into awareness". Rajneesh believed such cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> and enter meditation. Once the methods had provided a glimpse of meditation people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.|$|E

Captain Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. [...] "I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> back and be {{at the mercy of the}} pilot." [...] Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, [...] "What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!" [...] He went on to command the Saratoga, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, [...] "The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good." [...] Captain Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.|$|E
