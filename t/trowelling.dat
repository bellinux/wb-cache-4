60|$|Her {{married life}} glided happily on. She was alone all day, for, after an early breakfast her husband {{repaired}} {{every morning to}} the City, and did not return until their late dinner hour. He was 'in a China house,' he explained to Bella: which she found quite satisfactory, without pursuing the China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea, rice, odd-smelling silks, carved boxes, and tight-eyed people in more than double-soled shoes, with their pigtails pulling their heads of hair off, painted on transparent porcelain. She always walked with her husband to the railroad, and was always there again to meet him; her old coquettish ways a little sobered down (but not much), and her dress as daintily managed as if she managed nothing else. But, John gone to business and Bella returned home, the dress would be laid aside, trim little wrappers and aprons would be substituted, and Bella, putting back her hair with both hands, {{as if she were}} making the most business-like arrangements for going dramatically distracted, would enter on the household affairs of the day. Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating, such dusting and washing and polishing, such snipping and weeding and <b>trowelling</b> and other small gardening, such making and mending and folding and airing, such diverse arrangements, and above all such severe study! For Mrs J. R., who had never been wont to do too much at home as Miss B. W., was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family Housewife, which she would sit consulting, with her elbows on the table and her temples on her hands, like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art. This, principally because the Complete British Housewife, however sound a Briton at heart, was by no means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue, and sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamskatchan language. In any crisis of this nature, Bella would suddenly exclaim aloud, 'Oh you ridiculous old thing, {{what do you mean by}} that? You must have been drinking!' And having made this marginal note, would try the Housewife again, with all her dimples screwed into an expression of profound research.|$|E
50|$|Mortars {{consist of}} finely ground {{refractory}} materials mixed {{with water to}} form a paste. They are used for laying and bonding shaped refractory products such as bricks. They are normally applied by <b>trowelling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over {{the past}} fifteen or twenty years, hoes have become {{increasingly}} popular tools for professional archaeologists. While not as accurate as the traditional trowel, the hoe is an ideal tool for cleaning relatively large open areas of archaeological interest. It is faster to use than a trowel, and produces a much cleaner surface than an excavator bucket or shovel-scrape, and consequently on many open-area excavations the once-common line of kneeling archaeologists <b>trowelling</b> backwards has been replaced with a line of stooping archaeologists with hoes.|$|E
50|$|Batches of {{pigmented}} plaster (ground alabaster or gypsum) modified {{with animal}} glue {{are applied to}} molds, armatures and pre-plastered wall planes {{in a manner that}} accurately mimics natural stone, breccia and marble. In one technique, veining is created by drawing strands of raw silk saturated in pigment through the plaster mix. Another technique involves <b>trowelling</b> on several layers of translucent renders and randomly cutting back to a previous layer to achieve colour differential similar to jasper. When dry, the damp surface was pumiced smooth, then buffed with a linen cloth impregnated with Tripoli (a siliceous rottenstone) and charcoal; finally it was buffed with oiled felt; beeswax was sometimes used for this purpose. Because the colours are integral to the plaster, the pattern is more resistant to scratching than with other techniques, such as painting on wood.|$|E

40|$|A thin, room-temperature-curing, ceramic {{composite}} for coating and patching metal substrates comprises a sol gel silica glass matrix filled with finely ground particles or fibers, preferably alumina. The sol gel glass {{is made by}} adding ethanol to water to form a first mixture, then separately adding ethanol to tetraethyl orthosilicate to form a second mixture, then slowly adding the first to the second mixture to make a third mixture, and making a slurry by adding the finely ground particles or fibers to the third mixture. The composite can be applied by spraying, brushing or <b>trowelling.</b> If applied to patch fine cracks, densification of the {{ceramic composite}} may be obtained to enhance sealing by applying heat during curing...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{technology}} is an intrinsically visual discipline and structural design theory and principles must be contextually linked to construction practice. Slides, digital images and digital video from past and current construction sites are used during lectures to provide these links. The web based learning tool developed is also {{linked to a}} database of construction images. The students then {{have the ability to}} access and review all the lecture images and can view the full database of images in their own time, further providing and reinforcing the contextual links. The web based tutorial exercises include appropriate questions based on the case study project images. The " Industrial Ground Slabs " topic was selected for web-based development. The package covered structural design principles, pouring sequences, joint types and layouts, formwork and joint detailing, pouring methods, <b>trowelling</b> methods, surface finishes and tolerances, curing and sealants...|$|E
40|$|The cost of {{concrete}} ground-supported floor slabs represents {{a significant proportion}} of the total capital cost of industrial projects. There are many structural design issues that impact on the concrete contractorsâ€™ method of construction. This is becoming more apparent with the use of new high-technology levelling and <b>trowelling</b> equipment, which has significantly increased the pour and finishing rates, resulting in much faster slab construction times compared with the traditional methods of construction. Selection of both the design and the construction methods exerts a large influence on the initial cost. According to the results of the research reported in this paper, {{it may be possible to}} save between 2 - 4 per cent of the building cost if high technology solutions are incorporated into the design and construction process. This paper investigates cost issues that impact on the design and construction of ground-supported floors for industrial buildings. <br /...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we explore what we {{perceive}} as pertinent features of shared experience at the excavations of an Iron Age Hillfort at Bodfari, North Wales, referencing artist, archaeologist and examples of seminal art works and archaeological records resulting through inter-disciplinary collaboration. We explore ways along which archaeological and artistic practices of improvisation become entangled and productive through their different modes of mark-making. We contend that marks and memories of artist and archaeologist alike emerge interactively, through the mutually constituting effects of the object of study, the tools of exploration, and the practitioners themselves, when they are enmeshed in the cross-modally bound activities. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, remote sensing, surveying, mattocking, <b>trowelling,</b> drawing, photographing, videoing and sound recording. These marks represent the co-signatories: the gesture of the often anonymous practitioners, the voice of the deposits, as well as the imprint of the tools, and their interplay creates a multi-threaded narrative documenting their modes of intra-action, in short our practices. They occupy the conceptual space of paradata, and in the process of saturating the interstices of digital cognitive prosthetics they lend probity to their translations in both art form and archive...|$|E
40|$|Superplasticiser (SP) is an {{indispensable}} {{ingredient in the}} production of contemporary concrete, which is designed to satisfy multi-concurrent performance criteria such as strength, flowability, passing ability, segregation and dimensional stability. Use of SP can decrease flocculation of fine powder and enhance the workability of concrete. However, {{at the same time it}} increases the shear thickening of concrete resulting in reduced pumping distance, less uniform mixing and more difficult on-site manual handling, e. g. shovelling or surface <b>trowelling.</b> Therefore, the SP dosage for concrete mix design should be limited, or more practically, fillers should be added to reduce the shear thickening. This paper proposes to decrease the shear thickening of cement powder paste by replacing part of the cement with an equal volume of filler. From the test results, it was evident that when fly ash, silica fume or limestone is added to replace cement, the shear thickening decreases significantly. Also, it was found that the shear thickening of cement powder paste can be correlated negatively to the wet packing density. As the wet packing density increases, the tendency of having clustering of particles or free polymer chains from the SP decreases and thus shear thickening...|$|E
