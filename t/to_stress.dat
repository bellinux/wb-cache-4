5|$|In March 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter {{met with}} Bukovsky at the White House. In the USSR {{the meeting was}} seen by dissidents and rights activists {{as a sign of}} the newly elected president's {{willingness}} <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> human rights in his foreign policy; the event provoked harsh criticism by Soviet leaders.|$|E
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed <b>to</b> <b>stress,</b> such as migrating great distances.|$|E

5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and {{is particularly important}} {{as a way of}} maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses <b>to</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, {{but those were}} unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented from carrying out their work by the local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still under constant guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994. She used the occasion <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> U.S. support for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which {{had been set up}} in 1993.|$|E

At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E
5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} Red Wings in 1966–67. His numbers were down as he won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The Red Wings missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the Red Wings, Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to writing {{for his own}} band and those led by others, Waldron wrote and arranged for early play-along records that were published by Music Minus One. Some of these recordings on which Waldron played were released under his name. He also wrote scores for modern ballet in the 1950s and started writing film scores in the following decade. His writing for the film The Cool World (released in 1964) was described in The Oxford Companion to Jazz {{as one of the}} first attempts <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> improvisation rather than composition in a jazz-based film score.|$|E

5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of.

5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis.

5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the child might feel about the loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E
5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E
