5|$|McEntire {{was a guest}} {{judge on}} the July 13, 2016 episode of America's Got Talent. She used her golden buzzer, which she could only use once and allowed an act <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to the live shows, on contortionist Sofie Dossi.|$|E

5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for him and had the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E
25|$|His other {{variation}} was the arm ball, {{which again}} uses a similar grip as the leg-break, but imparts a back-spin {{instead of a}} side-spin, and causes the ball <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> on without turning.|$|E

Again he spent much time in an {{isolation}} block for 23 hours a day. During this time, he met a criminal named John, with whom he planned {{to carry out a}} bank robbery upon his release. However, on the day it was planned to happen, John was arrested by the regional crime squad, and Ulliott was advised by John's wife <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight.</b> Not long after Ulliott met his second wife, he did indeed go straight, and there is no evidence he committed a crime after then.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} chapter the Irishman, paying for passage to Macao with 16th-century gold coins, finds himself {{defending}} the church of old Macau with Dominican monks against an invading army. It turns out that Camões had returned from his expedition to save the settlement. Pilar gives Camões his poem back, but again he is exiled. Before the Irishman sets sail to Hong Kong, he trails the half-Chinese daughter of a Portuguese governor. He is despondent since {{he was unable to}} help or harbor the spirit of the other who sought refuge in him. His final plan is <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> into China, from Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{took the}} second half kickoff and stormed down the field, {{overcoming}} some blown plays along the way. During the drive, Trudeau was sacked for an 11-yard loss on second down and 11, but a defensive holding penalty negated the play and gave the Colts a first down. Later on, Dickerson fumbled the ball, but Trudeau {{picked it up and}} threw a 15-yard first down completion to Bill Brooks. Eventually, Indianapolis reached the Browns 20-yard line, but linebacker Eddie Johnson hit Trudeau as he threw a pass, causing the ball <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> up in the air where it was intercepted by Wright at the 14.|$|E

25|$|With Kelleway's departure, the AIF squad {{was reduced}} to its nucleus of {{fourteen}} principal members: Herbie Collins (captain), Eric Bull, Cyril Docker, Jack Gregory, Allie Lampard, Ed Long, Jack Murray, Bert Oldfield, Nip Pellew, Bill Stirling, Johnny Taylor, Bill Trenerry, Carl Willis and Charles Winning. Their success was being noticed outside England and in due course the AIF Sports Control Board received a telegram from the South African government in Pretoria asking if the team could tour South Africa en route to Australia. The players held a meeting and were unanimous in their refusal as they wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> home once their tour of England was completed. However, the Australian Army thought differently and the Ministry of Defence ordered them, as serving officers and other ranks, to comply. Planning began for a tour of South Africa from October to December.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, {{overseen by}} Moses, tore through many {{residential}} neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens instead of following the East River. One {{portion of the}} expressway, the two-tiered Promenade section in Brooklyn Heights that was designed by Moses, was originally planned <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> through Hicks Street, then connect to the Brooklyn Bridge at Adams Street. Another route that was proposed by Moses would have continued up Hicks Street past Atlantic Avenue, removing all the buildings {{on one side of}} Court Street, then curving east into Tillary Street (at Cadman Plaza). The Brooklyn Heights Association was able to fight these proposed routes, which created the two-tiered section above Furman Street with the Promenade over it. Several tunnels have been proposed to replace the Promenade, but every tunnel proposal has been unable to get support or funds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} half of the 1990s, Mochizuki {{directed}} a series of yakuza movies that are considered his best work. Some of the films were a collaboration with novelist Yukio Yamanouchi who had once been a legal advisor to one of the yakuza syndicates. The first of the films, Another Lonely Hitman, about an old-time yakuza hitman who ends up battling his own gang, was released in 1995. The movie took the Best Film award at the 5th Japan Film Professional Awards and Mochizuki won the Best Director award. What critics consider his best film appeared in 1997, Onibi or The Fire Within, another study of an aging yakuza trying <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight.</b> Onibi won the Best Film award at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival and Mochizuki took the festival's Best Director award for this movie and his other 1997 film A Yakuza in Love. These were followed by the 1998 manga-based Mobster's Confession, a comical, cynical account of a small-time gangster and his girlfriend. By this time, Mochizuki had begun to attain an international reputation and the Rotterdam Film Festival held a ten-film retrospective on the director in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of the 1940 season, internal problems were brewing between the key personalities at the club. Some felt that the uneven performance of the team was due to Percy Bentley's coaching methods, {{and that he should}} be replaced. Jack Dyer walked out on the club and threatened to play in the VFA after his father, a committeeman who was involved with the anti-Bentley faction, lost his position at the board elections. Finally, the matter was resolved and Bentley kept his job, while Dyer returned to training {{on the eve of the}} season. The problems appeared to have been solved when Richmond won the semi-final against Melbourne <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> into the 1940 VFL Grand Final. However, Melbourne reversed this result with a crushing win to pinch the premiership. Richmond had been out-thought by their old mentor Frank 'Checker' Hughes, who had assigned a tagger to negate Dyer. Dyer was furious that Bentley had done nothing to prevent his opponent taking him out of the game. The Richmond committee agreed with this assessment, so when Bentley (after retiring as a player) attempted to negotiate a higher fee to continue his coaching tenure, he was rebuffed. Incensed, Bentley quit Punt Road and moved to Carlton as coach, adding further spice to an already fierce rivalry between the two clubs.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw five {{different}} clubs reach the First Division {{for the first}} time. In 1981, Swansea City reached the First Division after climbing from the Fourth Division in just four seasons – the fastest rise of any club throughout the league at the time. They topped the First Division more than once during the 1981–82 season before finishing sixth. However, Swansea's successive story was short-lived, and their second season among the elite ended in relegation, and by 1986 {{they were back in}} the Fourth Division, having narrowly avoided going out of business. In 1982, Watford reached the First Division under the chairmanship of Elton John, management of Graham Taylor, and with the scoring prowess of Luther Blissett and John Barnes in attack. They finished runners-up in the league in their first top division season and were FA Cup runners-up in their second, and survived in the First Division until 1988. Taylor later managed the England team, while Barnes went on to help Liverpool win five major trophies and was a regular member of the England side for {{the second half of the}} 1980s and into the 1990s. 1985 saw the promotion of Oxford United to the First Division, 23 years after being elected to the Football League. They survived for three seasons in the First Division and won the League Cup in their first season among the elite. An even bigger success story emerged soon after Oxford's First Division arrival, when Wimbledon won promotion to the First Division in 1986, a mere nine years after being elected to the Football League. They quickly established themselves in the First Division, finishing sixth in their first season at this level, and even more impressively won the FA Cup a year later, beating league champions Liverpool 1–0 in the Wembley final. Wimbledon would enjoy the longest stay in the top flight of any of the First Division's new arrivals of the 1980s, retaining their tenancy at this level for 14 years. 1988 saw Millwall reach the First Division for the first time. Tipped by many <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> back down, they actually topped the First Division briefly in its early stages before finishing 10th – the lowest position they occupied all season. They briefly went top of the league again during the second month of the following season, but finished the season relegated after just two seasons in the First Division.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} they claimed that {{a feeling of}} oppression and dreariness came over them. They then saw some men who looked like palace gardeners, who told them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> on.

[...] Jourdain noticed a cottage with {{a woman and a}} girl in the doorway. The woman was holding out a jug to the girl. Jourdain described it as a [...] "tableau vivant", a living picture, much like Madame Tussauds waxworks. Moberly did not observe the cottage, but felt the atmosphere change. She wrote: [...] "Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees seemed to become flat and lifeless, like wood worked in tapestry. There were no effects of light and shade, and no wind stirred the trees." ...|$|E
