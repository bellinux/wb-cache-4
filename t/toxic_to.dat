5|$|Some {{substances}} {{which are}} <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans {{have no effect}} on bees. If bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers, the resulting honey can be psychoactive, or even <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans, but innocuous to bees and their larvae. Poisoning from this honey is called mad honey disease.|$|E

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans and is also <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E

5|$|Various {{plants are}} known to have pollen which is <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey bees, in some cases killing the adults (e.g., Toxicoscordion), in other cases {{creating}} a problem only when passed to the brood (e.g., Heliconia). Other plants which have toxic pollen are Spathodea campanulata and Ochroma lagopus. Both the pollen and nectar of the California Buckeye (Aesculus californica) are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honeybees, and it is thought that other members of the Buckeye family are also.|$|E
5|$|Venom that is toxic only to {{a certain}} taxon, or {{strongly}} toxic {{only to a}} certain taxon, {{has been found in}} a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|E

5|$|Group 3 {{elements}} are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility, and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms.

5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits.
