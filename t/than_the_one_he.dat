5|$|In 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that a sequel to Wall Street, to be subtitled Money Never Sleeps, was already in pre-production. Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The film would also focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more chaotic financial world <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> once oversaw. Charlie Sheen would also reprise his character of Bud Fox, but only in a cameo role. Daryl Hannah would not {{be involved in the}} sequel.|$|E

While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also had to consider that the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; {{this was a very}} different way of working <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> uses when composing for games.|$|E

25|$|During the 2011–12 season, Rakitić {{continued}} to be a first team regular and a key component of the squad. Due to managerial changes and new tactical schemes introduced by new coach Marcelino, who was later replaced by Míchel, Rakitić was given a different role on the pitch <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> had the previous season, when he was used as central midfielder under coach Gregorio Manzano; {{during the course of the}} season, he was mostly deployed as a defensive midfielder. By the end of the season, he made total of 39 appearances for the club, provided six assists and scored one goal in the 2011–12 Copa del Rey.

500|$|Despite Gomułka's hopes, the elections, while victorious for him, did {{not mean}} the end of {{opposition}} to the communist rule. For a while, support for the Gomułka-led communist party ran high. Reflecting this, the period 1957-1963 is known as [...] "little stabilization". While his regime was much more liberal <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> succeeded, this gave rive to an opposition within the PZPR party, as some communist politicians, like General Mieczysław Moczar, saw Gomułka as [...] "too soft." [...] Meanwhile, dissension with the communist rule would grow, and the Polish 1970 protests, soon after the 1968 Polish political crisis, would eventually cause him to lose support with the PZPR party; suffering from nervous exhaustion, Gomułka would be forced to resign and replaced by Edward Gierek.|$|E

A few years later, after Carradine had experienced financial success with Kung Fu, he decided he wanted to make the story into a movie. He contacted Carr, who secured the rights to the Henry Morton Robinson novel, and began writing the screenplay.

500|$|Frank Gasparro's reverse {{design of}} the Kennedy half dollar was also {{influenced}} by the experience he gained from designing the President John. F. Kennedy appreciation medal. In 1962, President Kennedy had three hundred appreciation medals struck by the United States Mint in Philadelphia that were later presented during his June 23, 1963 through July 2, 1963 trip to the nations of Federal Republic of Germany, Germany (West Berlin), Ireland, United Kingdom, Italy, and the Vatican City State. [...] The reverse {{design of the}} Kennedy appreciation medal depicts a larger and more detailed Presidential Seal <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> designed on the Mint's Presidential series (Bureau of the Mint Presidential series stock medal #135 known as the John F. Kennedy Presidential inauguration medal). Gasparro's placement of his initials FG is also similarly located (under the right leg of the eagle) on both the Kennedy appreciation medal and Kennedy half dollar.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the film's {{announcement}} the plot details were kept under wraps, but Loeb later confirmed that its plot would primarily focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more [...] "chaotic" [...] financial world <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> once oversaw from the previous film. Its budget was reported to be between $60 million ($50 million with the tax credits) and $70 million. Money Never Sleeps was being used as the film's working title before being renamed Wall Street 2 at the director's request and finally changed to Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. As part of research for the film, Douglas and Stone had a dinner meeting with Samuel D. Waksal, the founder of the bio-pharmaceutical company ImClone Systems, who spent five years in federal prison for securities fraud. LaBeouf, along with Stone, discussed the financial collapse with multiple hedge fund managers.|$|E

500|$|The ending was {{altered by}} the writers; the protagonist chooses a {{completely}} different girl in the film <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> selects in the novel.

The writers were highly impressed and relieved by the characters' fine detailing in the novel, adding: [...] "The written matter was very strong and we had to just get a few layers on that." [...] While writing the screenplay, Mehta and Gowariker decided to have one song for each zodiac sign to bring out the personality of each sign and its related girl. They had to write each character with different nuances. The title of the film is taken from a fictional book, What's Your Raashee?, about the compatibility between the sun signs, which the protagonist reads in the film.|$|E

[...] Frank later begins a relationship with Bobby; Papps thought that his character's romance with Bobby was more genuine <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> shared with Roo. Dickson told Catherine Maloney from TV Guide that she was nervous about Bobby and Frank's first kiss. She explained {{that she had not}} kissed anyone in the business before and was fretting while filming. Papps told Dickson: [...] "Shut up and kiss me" [...] and they played out the start of their characters romance. The actress stated that her character just puts on a [...] "tough exterior" [...] but longs for somebody. She added that during the storyline, viewers had sided with Bobby and not Roo.|$|E
500|$|The 1878 Bland-Allison Act and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 {{required}} {{the government to}} buy large quantities of silver and strike it into coin. They had been passed as compromises between free silver and the gold standard. [...] Bryan, who had been elected {{after the passage of}} the latter enactment, initially had little to say on the subject. [...] Free silver was very popular among Nebraskans, though many powerful Democrats opposed it. [...] After his election to Congress, Bryan studied the currency question carefully, and came to believe in free silver; he also saw its political potential. [...] By 1893, Bryan had become a leading supporter of free silver, arguing in a speech in St. Louis that the gold standard was deflationary [...] "making a man pay a debt with a dollar larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> borrowed...

50|$|The film {{is about}} a group of {{scientists}} who begin a space voyage to find a mysterious alien creature, and in the process are victimized by the ship's malevolent computer. It was directed by Robert Collector, and stars Catherine Mary Stewart, Michael Praed, James Avery and John Standing. According to Martin, writer/producer Robert Jaffe probably adapted his script from the shorter novella version, since all of the secondary characters had different names <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> chose in <b>the</b> expanded version.

500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for}} the film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
500|$|As the province's fiscal {{situation}} worsened in late 2008, {{the government}} adapted its health policy. In December, Liepert {{announced a new}} seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than $21,325 but required those making more to {{pay as much as}} $7,500 for their drugs. In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay. Liepert said that the plan, $10 million more expensive <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo. The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000. While the Canada Health Act requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all [...] "medically necessary" [...] procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not [...] "medically necessary" [...] {{from the perspective of the}} Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E
