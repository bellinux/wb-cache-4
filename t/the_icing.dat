5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the aircraft was subject to so much icing that {{even if it had}} steered clear of Hummelfjell it would still have been forced to land or crash within short time. <b>The</b> <b>icing</b> happened extremely rapidly and the commission {{found that the}} pilots' choice to turn around the aircraft could not have happened earlier. It stated that the weather data which the pilots received at Værnes did not predict the conditions which led to <b>the</b> <b>icing.</b> However, it found that had the pilots conferenced in person with a meteorologist concerning the weather along the whole route the conditions may have been discovered in advance, and recommended that such procedures developed.|$|E
25|$|While a team is short-handed, {{they are}} {{permitted}} to ice the puck as they wish, without having <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> infraction called against them. This allows short-handed teams to relieve pressure more easily when defending with fewer skaters than their opponents. This exemption {{does not apply to}} teams whose opponents have pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker (unless the defending team is killing a penalty at the same time).|$|E

Stane {{personally}} {{took one of}} his performers to <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> House to audition. Ice House owner Willard Chilcott was at <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> House during that audition. After some discussiion about the entertainment busniess Chilcott offered Stane the opportunity to run <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> House.

25|$|All three {{crew members}} on board died when the {{aircraft}} struck the ground following a stall and rapid descent {{caused by the}} crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing. <b>The</b> <b>icing</b> occurred due to failure {{to turn on the}} pitot tube heating {{at the start of the}} flight. This was one of two Boeing 727s to crash in the United States that day; the other was TWA Flight 514 in northern Virginia, northwest of Dulles airport.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{captain was}} killed in the impact and a {{passenger}} died shortly afterwards. Ten people survived the crash, which was the first fatal accident of Braathens SAFE. Amongst the survivors was Rolf Kirkvaag, at the time Norway's most popular radio host. The search and rescue operation was severely hindered by a blizzard and poor visibility. Kirkvaag and another person left the plane after a day and met a rescue party. The investigation concluded that there were neither technical faults with the aircraft nor pilot error, and that {{it was not possible to}} predict the weather conditions which caused <b>the</b> <b>icing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The flight {{departed}} Værnes at 8:30. It {{climbed to}} a cruising altitude of 2,500meters (8,000ft) and passed Tolga Radio Beacon at 09:12. In {{the area around}} Røros the aircraft started experiencing icing, which quickly rose to levels {{which could not be}} handled by the ice protection system. In addition, the aircraft was subject to a downdraft. The pilots therefore chose to turn the aircraft around and return to Trondheim. However, <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> was so aggressive that the aircraft continued to lose elevation. It was flying through a blizzard and there was poor sight, making navigation difficult.|$|E

40|$|Ice discs were {{released}} {{at the surface}} of a thermalized aluminium plate.

For <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> discs, we observe that, while <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> discs were melting, they were rotating. <b>The</b> <b>ice</b> disc rotates starts rotating.

25|$|The {{route to}} Haguesund {{continued}} until 29 September 1956. From then {{the local authorities}} stated that they would rather than the subsidies be used to build a land airport than retain sea services. Braathens SAFE {{was selected as the}} operator of the coastal routes from Ålesund instead of West Norway Airlines. Following <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> incident leading to the crash of Braathens SAFE Flight 253 in 1956, the aviation authorities banned winter operations of the Herons. Thus newer aircraft were needed. Braathens SAFE offered to cross-subsidize the coastal route Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim in exchange for receiving a monopoly on the profitable Oslo route. Left without concessions, the airline filed for bankruptcy {{at the end of the}} 1957 season.|$|E
25|$|Halloween cake is {{prepared}} with Halloween symbols and themes. It may be prepared with orange and black coloration in {{the cake and}} icing, because orange is a traditional color associated with Halloween, such as the color of pumpkins, which are used to create jack-o'-lanterns. Black is another traditional Halloween color, and black coloration may be used on graveyard-themed cakes, among others. Food coloring {{may be used in}} <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> to color it. Carrot cakes are sometimes prepared as Halloween cakes, per their orange coloration. They are sometimes prepared as a spice cake, as a chocolate cake, as a pudding cake, and as a cheesecake. Halloween cake may be prepared as a layer cake, and also as cake pops and cupcakes. It may be displayed as part of the Halloween decorations during the holiday. Candy corn may be used as a cake decoration, as well as candy pumpkins.|$|E
25|$|Holders Paris Saint-Germain were {{through to}} the last-16 of the League Cup after Fabrice Pancrate's goal proved enough for the reigning champions to beat AS Monaco. Paris Saint-Germain's defence of the League Cup {{continued}} against Nancy after the draw for the last-16, quarter-finals and semi-finals was made. Péguy Luyindula scored both goals in Paris Saint-Germain's victory over Nancy to send the holders {{through to the}} quarter-finals of the League Cup. In a dramatic twist of fate, Paris Saint-Germain hosted Lens in the pick of the quarter-final draw. In a remake of last season's Final, Paris Saint-Germain defeated Lens at the Parc des Princes {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals of the League Cup, where they met Bordeaux, winners over Châteauroux. Late goals from Souleymane Diawara and Wendel added to David Bellion's first-half strike put <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> on the cake as Bordeaux cruised past Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the return}} {{leg of the}} quarter final tie, the Mariners {{demolished}} Salgaocar 4–0 riding on a brace from Haitian playmaker Sony Norde and goals from Katsumi Yusa and Jeje Lalpekhlua. It was Katsumi Yusa who started the scoring in the 25th minute reaching {{at the end of}} a Sony Norde cross and tapping it easily into an open net. Minutes away from the half time whistle Sony Norde scored his first of the match and the tournament as he beautifully cut in from the left and put the ball in the net past the goalkeeper to ensure that Bagan went into the lemon break with a 3-goal advantage on aggregate. The Green and Maroon brigade started off the second half, where they ended the first. It was a piece of individual brilliance by Haitian playmaker Sony Norde as he went past three Salgaocar defenders and put the ball in the net with relative ease to score his second of the night. In the final minute of the match, a beautiful through ball from Cornell Glen saw Jeje Lalpekhlua tap it in with utter ease to put <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> on the cake of the Green and Maroon victory.|$|E
