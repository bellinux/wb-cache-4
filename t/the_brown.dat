5|$|After his NFL career ended, Lillard {{joined the}} Westwood Cubs of the Pacific Coast Football League for the 1934 season, {{throwing}} the most touchdown passes of any {{player in the}} league and compiling the second-most touchdowns on runs. In 1935, he drew interest from coach Fritz Pollard, who was leading the New York Brown Bombers, a semi-professional team of African-American players. Based in Harlem, the team competed against minor league sides and clubs not affiliated with a league. Lillard had played for a Chicago team coached by Pollard before entering the NFL, and decided to join <b>the</b> <b>Brown</b> Bombers. In his first game with the team, on October 13, 1935, Lillard scored two touchdowns against the Cagle All-Stars in a 28–6 New York win. After three more victories, <b>the</b> <b>Brown</b> Bombers faced the Passaic Red Devils, a three-time champion of Eastern American football leagues. Despite suffering from an illness, Lillard converted a drop kick attempt and intercepted a pass, returning it 52yards for a touchdown.

Lillard stayed with <b>the</b> <b>Brown</b> Bombers through the 1937 season; the team went out of business in 1938.
