5|$|Fishing, {{being the}} {{traditional}} industry of the region, was always considered important, {{even though the}} volumes of production remained insignificant {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century. In the 1920s–1930s, the Murmansk <b>Trawl</b> Fleet was created and the fishing infrastructure started to develop intensively. By 1940, fishing accounted for 40% of the oblast's and for 80% of Murmansk's economy.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} {{is frequently}} caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia's South East <b>Trawl</b> Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, but probably high, rate of survival. Since this species {{does not appear}} to be threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea <b>trawl,</b> gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species <b>trawl</b> fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E
50|$|Midwater <b>trawling</b> is <b>trawling,</b> or net fishing, {{at a depth}} that {{is higher}} {{in the water column}} than the bottom of the ocean. It is contrasted with bottom <b>trawling.</b> Midwater <b>trawling</b> is also known as pelagic <b>trawling</b> and bottom <b>trawling</b> as benthic <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> can be {{contrasted with}} {{midwater}} <b>trawling</b> (also known as pelagic <b>trawling),</b> where a net is towed {{higher in the}} water column. Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, and mackerel, whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
25|$|Midwater <b>trawling</b> is {{also known}} as pelagic <b>trawling.</b> Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|R
5|$|The fishing industry, {{although}} still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production, remains profitable, supplying 20% of Russia's fish in 2006 {{and with the}} volumes steadily growing in 2007–2010. Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets, including Russia's largest, the Murmansk <b>Trawl</b> Fleet. Fish breeding, especially of salmon and trout, is a growing industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the <b>trawl.</b> Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast <b>Trawl</b> Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom <b>trawl</b> commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trawling</b> can be {{contrasted with}} trolling, where baited fishing lines instead of <b>trawls</b> are drawn through the water. Trolling is used both for {{recreational}} and commercial fishing whereas <b>trawling</b> is used mainly for commercial fishing. <b>Trawling</b> is also commonly {{used as a}} scientific sampling, or survey, method.|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{estimates of}} <b>trawling</b> effort {{are needed to}} underpin studies of <b>trawling</b> impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystem processes, and to monitor responses to area closure and other management actions. Satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS) were designed for fishery control and enforcement, but they provide potentially valuable source information on spatial and temporal patterns of <b>trawling</b> activity at multiple scales. Based on an analysis of VMS data for UK beam trawlers in the North Sea, a method is described for identifying <b>trawling</b> activity and estimating fishing intensity based on the minimum and maximum potential spatial extent of <b>trawling</b> effort from VMS data. The optimal method for identifying <b>trawling</b> and steaming behaviour combined speed and directionality rules and correctly identified <b>trawling</b> and steaming in 99 % and 95 % of cases, respectively. Using speed- and directionality-filtered VMS data, <b>trawling</b> effort can be reported as area impacted per unit time per unit area at a range of grid scales from 1 km to 100 km (10 000 km 2). <b>Trawling</b> effort is accurately represented at a grid cell resolution of 3 km or less...|$|R

5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of <b>trawl</b> fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom <b>trawl</b> fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by <b>trawl</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and longline fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of commercial small craft pair <b>trawling</b> trials conducted on Lake Chilwa from May to August 1971. Type of vessels and equipment {{used and the}} fishing method and operation employed are described and design data given for the different <b>trawls</b> used. The effects on catching efficiency of varying amounts of small mesh netting <b>trawls</b> are dealt with and recommendations made for <b>trawls</b> design modifications...|$|R
40|$|Many studies {{highlight}} {{that fish}} <b>trawling</b> activities cause seafloor erosion, but {{the assessment of}} the remobilization of surface sediments and its relocation is still not well documented. These impacts were examined along the flanks and axes of three headless submarine canyons incised on the Barcelona continental margin, where <b>trawling</b> fleets have been operating for decades. <b>Trawled</b> grounds along canyon flanks presented eroded and highly reworked surface sediments resulting from the passage of heavy <b>trawling</b> gear. Sedimentation rates on the upper canyon axes tripled and quadrupled its natural (i. e. pre-industrialization) values after a substantial increase in total horsepower of the operating <b>trawling</b> fleets between 1960 s and 1970 s. These impacts affected the upper canyon reaches next to fishing grounds, where sediment resuspended by <b>trawling</b> can be transported towards the canyon axes. This study highlights that bottom <b>trawling</b> has the capacity to alter natural sedimentary environments by promoting sediment-starved canyon flanks, and by enhancing sedimentation rates along the contiguous axes, independently of canyons’ morphology. Considering the global mechanisation and offshore expansion of bottom <b>trawling</b> fisheries since the mid- 20 th century, these sedimentary alterations may occur in many <b>trawled</b> canyons worldwide, with further ecological impacts on the trophic status of these non-resilient benthic communities...|$|R
40|$|Experimental otter <b>trawling</b> {{was carried}} out for 11 months (May 2001 -November 2002) off Mangalore coast to {{evaluate}} its immediate effect on physicochemical parameters of seawatej. Five stations (1 - 5) with increasing depths (]Om, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 rn) were selected for the study using a systematic BACI (Before 1 After and Controlllmpact) design. <b>Trawling</b> impact on the changes in salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and nutrients (nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate) were assessed. Temperature, salinity and pH were similar before and after <b>trawling.</b> The results indicate that TSS at surface and bottom waters increased immediately after <b>trawling</b> which was prominent at the shallow stations with significant difference (P < 0. 05) at station 2. Changes in nutrient load by <b>trawling</b> were occasionally observed. <b>Trawling</b> had only a minor effect on transparency, dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Multivariate analysis (PCA) also revealed minor impact on the physicochernical parameters due to <b>trawling...</b>|$|R
5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom <b>trawl</b> and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East <b>Trawl</b> Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting shallow, sandy areas near rocky reefs, the Japanese sleeper ray is a bottom-dwelling {{predator}} of invertebrates. Like {{other members}} of its family, it can produce a strong electric shock from its electric organs for defensive purposes. Females give live birth to litters of up to five pups. The gestating young are sustained at first by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Vulnerable, due to its susceptibility to <b>trawl</b> fisheries that operate intensively throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom <b>trawl</b> and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
50|$|Whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> {{can leave}} serious {{incidental}} {{damage to the}} sea bottom in its trail, midwater <b>trawling</b> by contrast is relatively benign.|$|R
40|$|Disturbance due to <b>trawling</b> {{reduces the}} biomass and {{production}} of macro-infaunal invertebrate communities, implying that their total food-consumption rate will fall, and that production (carbon) reaching the sea floor will be processed by other animals that can withstand the effects of <b>trawling.</b> Meiofauna may be resistant to disturbance by <b>trawling</b> because {{they are likely to}} be resuspended rather than killed by <b>trawls</b> and because their short generation times would allow them to withstand elevated mortality. We used a BACI experimental approach to investigate the short-term effects of beam <b>trawling</b> on the diversity, biomass and community structure of meiofauna on real fishing grounds in the southern North Sea. Experiments at two locations showed that there were no short- to medium-term (1 - 392 days after experimental <b>trawling)</b> <b>trawling</b> impacts on meiofaunal diversity or biomass, but that there were mild effects on community structure. Any impacts due to <b>trawling</b> were minor in relation to seasonal changes in the meiofaunal communities. We assessed the power of our experiments to detect the effects of <b>trawling</b> and recorded a 44 - 85 % chance of detecting a 50 % change in species richness and a 65 % chance of detecting an order-of-magnitude change in biomass. The power to detect changes in total abundance, however, was low (between 11 % and 12 % power for detecting a change of 50 %). We suggest that meiofauna are more resistant to disturbance by beam <b>trawling</b> than are macrofauna and that they have the potential to withstand the effects of chronic <b>trawling</b> on real fishing grounds and to retain a key role in energy cycling...|$|R
40|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> {{leads to}} {{recurrent}} sediment resuspension events over fishing grounds. Recent {{studies have shown}} how bottom <b>trawling</b> can drive seascape reshaping at large spatial scales and enhance sediment transport in submarine canyons, which subsequently impacts deep-sea ecosystems. Present knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of sediment flows triggered by bottom <b>trawling</b> is based on localized and infrequent measurements whilst a more complete picture of the process is needed. The present work focuses on the modeling of sediment transport and accumulation resulting from <b>trawling</b> activities in La Fonera submarine canyon, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, thus contributing to an improved assessment of <b>trawling</b> impacts. Based on mooring data within a canyon gully, we use an inverse model to retrieve the unknown time series of resuspension due to <b>trawling</b> over the fishing grounds. This resuspension is later used as forcing for the direct problem: we simulate trawling-induced flows through the canyon and provide a 3 D visualization of potential <b>trawling</b> impacts on sediment dynamics, including {{the identification of the}} propagation patterns of sediments resuspended by <b>trawling.</b> Flows coming from shallower fishing grounds are funneled through canyon flank gullies towards the canyon axis, with part of the resuspended sediment reaching the continental rise out of the canyon across the open continental slope. Trawling-induced sediment flows promote sediment accumulation beyond the canyon mouth. Given the wide geographical distribution of bottom <b>trawling,</b> our results have far-reaching implications that go much beyond La Fonera submarine canyon. Our study represents a starting point for the assessment of the sedimentary impact of bottom <b>trawling</b> in deep continental margins...|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom <b>trawl</b> fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the sand}} devil {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young nourished by their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4–25 pups in spring or early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt to bite if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial bottom <b>trawl</b> fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray fights strongly on hook-and-line {{and is thus}} {{popular with}} recreational anglers, who usually release it alive. This species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean, using bottom trawls, gillnets and tangle nets, beach seines, and longlines. In particular, it is caught in substantial numbers by an Indonesian <b>trawl</b> fishery targeting wedgefishes in the Arafura Sea. The meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized, though this species is not a highly valued food fish. It also has applications in Chinese medicine, and its tail may be sold as a curio.|$|E
25|$|The {{boats that}} are used for <b>trawling</b> are called {{trawlers}} or draggers. Trawlers vary in size from small open boats with as little as 30 hp (22 kW) engines to large factory trawlers with over 10,000hp (7.5 MW). <b>Trawling</b> {{can be carried out}} by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair <b>trawling).</b>|$|R

5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial <b>trawl</b> fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom <b>trawl</b> fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters of one to six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal gillnet fisheries and perhaps also by line and <b>trawl</b> fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
40|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> causes {{widespread}} disturbance to the sediments in shallow-shelf seas. The resultant {{mortality of}} benthic fauna is strongly size dependent. We empirically demonstrate that beam <b>trawling</b> frequency {{in the central}} North Sea had a greater effect on fauna size distribution in a soft sediment benthic community than variables such as sediment particle size and water depth. Accordingly, we simulated the impacts of <b>trawling</b> disturbance on benthos using a model consisting of 37 organism size classes between 1 µg and 140 g wet weight. The model produced a production-biomass versus size relationship consistent with published studies and allowed us to predict the impacts of <b>trawling</b> frequency on benthos size distributions. Outputs were consistent with empirical data; however, at high yet realistic <b>trawling</b> frequencies, the model predicted an extirpation of most macrofauna. Empirical data show that macrofauna persist in many heavily <b>trawled</b> regions; therefore, we suggest that <b>trawling</b> by real fisheries is sufficiently heterogeneous to provide spatial refuges less impacted by <b>trawling.</b> If correct, our analyses suggest that fishery management measures that do not reduce total effort but do lead to effort displacement and spatial homogenization (e. g., temporarily closed areas) may have adverse effects on the systemic persistence of intermediate- and large-sized macrofauna...|$|R
