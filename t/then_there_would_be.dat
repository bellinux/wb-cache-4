5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} {{consensus}} that vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or somewhere in between. If the higher figure were true, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the origins}} of the position, Ellison was {{instrumental}} in promoting its adoption throughout New Zealand. Although it is unclear whether the wing-forward was used during the 1893 tour of Australia, {{by the time of the}} All Blacks' first Test match, played during their 1903 Australian tour, the position was engrained within the New Zealand style of play. The use of a wing-forward provoked controversy both in New Zealand, and later in the British Isles after the All Blacks toured there in 1905; wing-forwards were often accused of off-side obstruction of the opposition half-back. According to Ellison however, if the position was implemented properly, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no cause for complaint. The wing-forward continued as a vital component of New Zealand rugby until long-standing complaints from the unions of the Home Nations resulted in the position being outlawed by the International Rugby Football Board in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good crops. It {{is said to be}} taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E

25|$|Housing First is an {{initiative}} to help homeless people reintegrate into society, {{and out of}} homeless shelters. It was initiated by the federal government's Interagency Council on Homelessness. It asks cities {{to come up with}} a plan to end chronic homelessness. In this direction, there is the belief that if homeless people are given independent housing to start, with some proper social supports, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no need for emergency homeless shelters, which it considers a good outcome. However this is a controversial position.|$|E
25|$|It has {{previously}} been interpreted that variation in ankylosaurid tail club shape is due to sexual dimorphism, which assumes that tail club morphology has a sex-linked intraspecific function. This is possible if the tail club was used for agonistic behaviour. However, a sexual dimorphism theory would predict roughly equal numbers of individuals with two distinct sizes of tail clubs. Obvious sexual dimorphism has not been documented, but if the clubs of one sex are much larger, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a bias for preservation and discovery towards that sex.|$|E

25|$|The known rate of {{the decay}} process {{together}} with the inter-atomic spacing in a metallic crystal makes heat transfer of the 24 MeV excess energy into the host metal lattice prior to the intermediary's decay inexplicable in terms of conventional understandings of momentum and energy transfer, and even <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> measurable levels of radiation. Also, experiments indicate that the ratios of deuterium fusion remain constant at different energies. In general, pressure and chemical environment only cause small changes to fusion ratios. An early explanation invoked the Oppenheimer–Phillips process at low energies, but its magnitude {{was too small to}} explain the altered ratios.|$|E
25|$|The {{interval}} AC in {{the diagram}} is 'space-like'; i.e., {{there is a}} frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in which C precedes A. If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events A and C, then paradoxes of causality would result. For example, if A was the cause, and C the effect, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> frames of reference in which the effect preceded the cause. Although this in itself won't {{give rise to a}} paradox, one can show that faster than light signals can be sent back into one's own past. A causal paradox can then be constructed by sending the signal if and only if no signal was received previously.|$|E
25|$|Chinese-Filipino families, casually called chinoys, {{practice}} {{a number of}} rituals whenever a loved one passes away. Most of these practices are derived from Chinese tradition and Buddhism with a slight incorporation of other religions. Traditional Chinese practices involve the burning of paper versions of material goods such as houses, cars, helicopters, yachts, and money, so that the deceased {{will be able to}} enjoy such in the afterlife. Loved ones are not also allowed to cut their locks for forty days and are encouraged to wear white from head to toe. The Buddhism aspect that is combined with these customs would be the burning of the incense and the offering of fruits as a sign of respect to the dead. The factor of other religions highly depends on the religion of the deceased and his/her loved one. If he/she is a Catholic/Protestant, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a mass/sermon held during his/her funeral.|$|E

25|$|During {{the final}} {{decade of the}} 19th Century, careful {{expansion}} nevertheless led to solid chapters at Yale (Sachem Hall), Columbia, Maryland, Penn State and Penn, among other storied schools. Dartmouth, Brown, and MIT followed soon after. Eventually Phi Sig was present at six of the eight Ivy League schools; even Canadian campuses were not excluded in the thinking of those who carried new chapters in all directions shortly {{after the turn of}} the century. Rho Chapter was organized at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario in 1903, and seventeen other units were added during the decade. Under Cutter's and Barrett's leadership, the national organization was strengthened, and work was begun among the alumni to support their continued interest in the Fraternity after graduation. The Greek system's uniqueness among American organizations is based partly on this principle – the idea of continued involvement for members after undergraduate days. Phi Sigma Kappa was one of the early leaders in such efforts and remains one of the strongest alumni-oriented groups. If Founder Brooks' assessment of its purpose is true, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no end to the Fraternity's influence on its members, and its role in their lives—another vital part of Phi Sig's heritage.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played {{each of the other}} teams in its group at least once, without extra time {{in the event of a}} draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, ostensibly that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.|$|E

In arriving at this decision, it said that the legislative history included two witnesses who stated that the Act would not affect hunting and fishing rights acquired by treaty, but would abrogate any such rights acquired by statute. Additionally, the Court of Claims observed that Congress also amended Public Law 280 so that Indian hunting and fishing rights were protected in Wisconsin.
