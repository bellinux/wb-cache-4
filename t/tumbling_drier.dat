40|$|Background: Several major {{outbreaks}} {{in healthcare}} facilities have occurred {{with the emergence}} of multi-resistant bacteria. A possible route for dissemination is the hospital textiles and inadequate laundering of them. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an easy-to-use method for simulating the laundering process of hospital textiles, and thereafter apply the method when evaluating the decontaminating efficacy of two different washing temperatures. Methods: The laundering process, including <b>tumble</b> <b>drying,</b> took place at two professional laundries. Enterococcus faecium was used as bioindicator. Results: The results showed that a lowering of the washing temperature from 70 °C to 60 °C did not affect the decontamination efficacy; the washing cycle alone reduced the number of bacteria with 3 – 5 log 10 CFU, whereas the following <b>tumble</b> <b>drying</b> reduced the bacterial numbers with another 3 – 4 log 10 CFU, yielding the same final result independent of washing temperature. Without <b>tumble</b> <b>drying,</b> there was an obvious risk of adding non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria to the fabric. These bacteria originated from the washing cycle. Conclusion: A simple method to simulate hospital laundering was developed. To save energy, it is possible to use a washing temperature of 60 °C, but the washing cycle should be followed by <b>tumble</b> <b>drying,</b> and the whole laundering process needs to be monitored to maintain sufficient textile hygiene...|$|R

The aim of the second study was to study the presence of TSST- 1 and three other important toxin genes in invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus collected during the years 2000 - 2012 at two tertiary hospitals. The genes encoding the staphylococcal toxins were detected by PCR, and whole-genome sequencing was used for analyzing the genetic relatedness between isolates. The results showed that the most common toxin was TSST- 1, and isolates positive for this toxin exhibited a clear clonality independent of year and hospital. The typical patient was a male aged 55 - 74 years and with a bone or a joint infection. The third study was a clinical study of the effect of silver-based wound dressings on the bacterial flora in chronic leg ulcers. Phenotypic and genetic silver-resistance were investigated before and after topical silver treatment, by determining the silver nitrate MICs and by detecting sil genes with PCR. The silver-based dressings had a limited effect on primary wound pathogens, and the activity of silver nitrate on S. aureus was mainly bacteriostatic. A silver-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain was identified after only three weeks of treatment, and cephalosporin-resistant members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were relatively prone to developed silver-resistance after silver exposure in vitro.

This {{study examined the}} effect of dryer diameter, RPM, airflow, and flower compaction on threshing petals from marigold flowers using two types of rotary dryers. A sectored rotary dryer was tested at three rotational speeds (2, 4, and 8 rpm) and two diameters (1. 2 and 1. 8 m). An open–chamber rotary dryer was tested with three levels of flower compaction (1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 X) and three airflows (4. 3, 4. 5, and 5. 3 changes/min). Both the sectored and open chamber dryers performed well in drying and threshing petals from flowers. In most tests, more than 80 % of the petals were threshed when their moisture dropped to less than 10 %, i. e., within 20 to 24 h of drying. Threshing performance was different between the sectored and open dryer. The sectored dryer had a relatively large increase in the threshing rate after 10 to 15 h of drying while the open dryer’s threshing rates remained fairly constant. The open dryer produced more threshed, high moisture petals. Threshed material from both dryers contained an insignificant amount of trash. The threshing characteristics for both dryer types were unaffected by changes in operating speed, amount of compaction, and airflow. However, by using higher compaction, the open dryer can thresh 50 to 100 % more flowers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tumble</b> dryers and <b>drying</b> {{cabinets}} have to a {{large extent}} replaced the traditional way of drying clothes outdoors. They are faster, more convenient, require less space and can be operated regardless of weather conditions. This replacement has significantly increased residential energy consumption, {{due to the fact that}} tumbles dryers consume large amounts of electrical energy. In the USA 9 % of the households electric energy is consumed when drying clothes. Over 4 million tumble dryers are sold in Europe each year and 20 % of the residential electricity consumption in Sweden is used drying and washing clothes. Tumble dryers are also utilized in the industrial sector, but industrial dryers are not considered in this study. Increasing energy costs contributes to the public’s awareness and desire to cut their energy consumption. The aim of this study is to increase the energy efficiency and drastically reduce electric power use of tumble dryers. There are two main types of tumble dryers available on the market; the open cycle tumble dryer and the closed cycle tumble dryer. The open cycle tumble dryer is often attached to the ventilation system and thereby it evacuates its exhaust air. The closed cycle tumble dryer condenses the water from the air before it recirculates it. To increase the energy efficiency and reduce electric power use of tumble dryers, two separate studies were made. One on a water cooled closed cycle tumble dryer and one on a hot water heated open cycle tumble dryer. Both tumble dryers where rebuild and originated from the same tumble dryer. The tumble dryer that both studies originated from was a conventional air cooled closed cycle tumble dryer. The tumble dryer is made by Asko Cylinda AB. The results reveal that the water cooled closed cycle tumble dryer does not have greater energy efficiency than the conventional air cooled closed cycle tumble dryer. However the drying time was reduced by 37 %.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} treatment of solids {{is one of}} the most common and widely used operations which man has been concerned from the very beginning of the history of civilization. Nowadays, mechanical activation has a wide range of application potentials. Mechanical activation processes are used to modify the properties of materials, to enhance the reactivity of materials and to produce advanced materials and to separate composite materials into its constituents. When materials are subjected to intensive grinding, the structure and microstructure characters of material change widely. These structural changes determine the reactivity of materials and/or minerals and may play an important role in subsequent processes. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the grinding techniques on the microstructure and structural changes of natural hematite. The influences of the five grinding methods with various grinding variables have been investigated: (1) three types of loose media mills in dry mode, (2) interparticle comminution in a confined piston-die press and (3) a stirred media mill in wet mode. A variety of microstructural characterization methods based on X-ray diffraction line profile analysis such as Warren-Averbach, Williamson-Hall and Rietveld methods associated with other characterizations methods have been employed in the present study. In addition, the effects of mechanical activation on the thermal reactivity of hematite concentrate have been studied using hydrogen reduction of activated samples. The results reveal that mechanical activation of hematite causes great changes in geometrical and microstructural characteristics with increased grinding intensity, whatever milling methods were applied. In the case of dry grinding with loose media mills, the results show that the particles show a tendency to form agglomerates during prolonged milling. The expansions of hematite lattice and volume cell were identified. The Williamson-Hall method provides itself to be a technique for a rapid overview of the X-ray line broadening effects and facilitates the understanding of the influence of grinding processes on the material structures. The anisotropic character of line broadening for deformed hematite as a function of grinding variables was revealed. From the Warren- Averbach method, it has been found that the planetary mill products yield the smallest crystallites and the maximum root mean square strain (RMSS) with one exception. The products of the vibratory mill yield approximately lower X-ray amorphization degree with regard to the grinding time and media surface variables. The approximation of the energy contribution to the long- lived defects demonstrated that the amorphization character is the most important energy carrier in the activated hematite, accounting for more than 93 % of overall stored energy in hematite. The comparison of the loose media mills based on stress energy revealed that the vibratory mill brings about less distortion in the hematite than other mills for the same level of stress energy. In addition, the variance analysis revealed that the media surface and grinding time significantly influence the five main response variables at 95 % confidence level. Multivariate techniques are successfully applied for projection of microstructure characters to identify the salient features underlying the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) makes it possible to predict easily which condition leads to production of similar properties or microstructure characters and opens a new window for prediction of microstructure characteristics based on changes in the grinding variables for further investigations. Partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) analysis suggested that mills could be differentiated from each other. From the interparticle comminution investigations, it has been found that the energy absorption is the dominating factor for the size reduction, surface area and induced structural changes in the particle bed comminution. It was also found that the interparticle breakage causes plastic deformation in the material and subsequently induces changes in the structure of the ground hematite and thus provides evidences for the activation potentiality of this method. The comparison with loose media mill (tumbling) in terms of net grinding energy indicated that the interparticle breakage has high energy transfer efficiency to the particles being ground and subsequently favor in the structural changes for a given energy. The comparison of the <b>dry</b> <b>tumbling</b> milling with wet stirred media milling showed that the stirred media mill is more effective in producing structural changes compared to the dry operation; although the X-ray amorphous phase content remained unaffected by the grinding environments, but a large difference was observed in the production of BET surface area. The milling process has been shown to have a pronounced influence on the reduction behavior and kinetic scheme of hematite especially at lower temperature or conversion degrees. Mechanical activation of hematite concentrate lead to the initiation of reduction at lower temperatures. The starting temperature of the reduction was decreased to from 420 about 330 ˚C depending on grinding intensity. Moreover, the pretreatment resulted in improved resolution of overlapping reduction events and the activation energy of the first step of reduction decreased with increasing grinding time. The study showed that the activation energy of the two steps of the reduction depends greatly on the extent of conversion implicating that the reduction processes of hematite to magnetite and magnetite to iron features multi-step characteristics. To investigate the influence of other milling variables in detail, more investigations are recommended, especially as the experiment design and progress in the knowledge to-day provide possibilities to use advanced methods for characterization and analysis. In our opinion, the investigation of the effects of various defects formed during mechanical activation on the reactivity of the minerals are currently only at the beginning of their developments. Systematic investigations are recommended to explore what defects are formed in the crystal of the substances under various types of mechanical action and how these defects influence the reactivity.
