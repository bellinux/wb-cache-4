5|$|Construction {{began on}} 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the {{foundation}} stone. Two days prior, the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> has only one terminal.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the second}} airport in Båtsfjord. The first was built in 1973, but only had a gravel runway. When Widerøe {{replaced}} their smaller de Havilland Canada Twin Otters with the Dash8, a new airport was needed to serve Båtsfjord. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> cost 178million Norwegian krone and opened on 9September1999.|$|E
5|$|Bringelandsåsen was {{proposed}} by the CAA in 1974.

5|$|Financing of {{the airport}} at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued to a limited company owned by the Civil Airport Administration. This company would build and operate Gardermoen, but from 1 January 1997 it also took over {{operation}} of Fornebu. After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998, 300 people spent the night transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> opened {{on the morning of}} 8 October 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Indian {{government}} acting for the Bhutanese government, {{conducted a}} feasibility study into {{the viability of}} an international airport near the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu. In the five-year plan (which covers 2008–2013) the sum of BTN 2,826 million had been allocated by the Bhutanese government for development of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport.</b> A preliminary survey was conducted by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu {{would be used for}} domestic flights only.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} was delivered on 1 August 1998. While <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> at Gardermoen would not officially open until 8 October, when also SAS and Braathens {{would move to}} the airport, Color Air started flights from Gardermoen to Ålesund Airport, Vigra on 6 August.

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> {{opened on}} 8 October 1998 the Flytoget airport express trains started {{operating}} immediately, {{as did the}} Gardermoen Line from Lillestrøm {{to the airport and}} onwards to Eidsvoll. Because the tunnel was not finished, trains were required to use the old Trunk Line from Oslo Central Station to Lillestrøm. After this diversion the express trains switched to the completed section of the new Gardermoen Line between Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport. Regular operations using the Romerike Tunnel started on 22 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|With {{increased}} traffic, there {{soon became}} a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. During the peak times during the morning and afternoon rush, there were no excess slots for new airlines. To compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration was building a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, after <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> {{was decided}} located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E

5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a new airport in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash8 aircraft. Airport security was introduced on 1January2005.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he would establish a low-cost airline following the opening of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport.</b> The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 1997, {{the airline}} {{announced}} it had ordered six 134-seat Boeing 737-700 aircraft for NOK1.5 billion. These aircraft would be delivered in 1998, {{prior to the}} opening of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> at Gardermoen. In addition, the airline had an option for additional ten planes to be delivered after 2000. In 1997, Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with Boeing 737s. In May 1997, Braathens SAFE was criticized by the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association because it was using retired Braathens SAFE pilots to fly Transwede aircraft, due to Transwede not having certified pilots for their new Boeing 737-300. Braathens SAFE stated that this was within the rules of the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration and the Joint Aviation Authorities.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for a {{concession}} to fly to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied to fly the Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE to fly the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.|$|E
5|$|SAS {{introduced}} the 52-passenger Convair Metropolitan on their domestic services, while Finnair served the airport with the 30-seat Douglas DC-3 on their flights to Finland. In {{the first month}} the two airlines had 88 aircraft movements, while the Royal Norwegian Air Force had 44 and Varangfly 60. Both SAS and Finnair replaced Varangfly's routes, which did not operate scheduled flights from <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport.</b> Varangfly therefore sold its land aircraft and instead became a seaplane operator. SAS {{introduced the}} 122-passenger Douglas DC-9 jet aircraft at Kirkenes from 1969. Helikopter Service flew a civilian helicopter to Høybuktmoen {{for the first time}} the same year. Kirkenes Airport served 20,638 passengers in 1964 and 40,477 in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 {{that they were}} considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport {{did not meet the}} demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It {{had flown}} a scheduled route to Kjeller, {{and the captain}} had continued to Fornebu to try <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport.</b> On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made a mistake, and took off from the parking space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.|$|E
5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{applied for}} the {{concession}} to fly from the mainland to Norway. This was granted to SAS, who would have one weekly service. From the airport was taken into use until the official opening, Braathens SAFE continued to fly charter flights for Store Norske. The first landing at <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> was made on 14 September 1974 with a Fokker F-28, and Braathens SAFE continued to fly until 1 September 1975. Russian authorities granted a concession for a semi-weekly service by Aeroflot from Murmansk Airport. The first attempt to officially open the airport was made with a SAS Douglas DC-9 on 14 August 1975. Among the guests on board was King Olav V, but thick fog at Longyearbyen forced the airplane to return. On 1 September, a Fokker F-27 from Braathens SAFE was used to calibrate the runways; on board were pilots from SAS and Aeroflot {{to learn about the}} landing conditions. The following day, the second attempt to open the airport was successful. In addition to the scheduled services, Store Norske chartered cargo flights from Fred Olsen Air Transport.|$|E
5|$|The same year, the {{government}} appointed a commission, led by Bue Fjermeros, {{to look into}} the organization of the domestic air routes. Since the last compromise in splitting routes, the traffic had increased more in Braathens SAFE's domain that SAS'. The commission also looked a to whom the two next airports that would be opened, Haugesund Airport, Karmøy and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, would be given. Neither company wanted to cooperate beyond the existing arrangement of coordinating their routes time-wise, along with those of Widerøe. In addition, Braathens SAFE bought handling services from SAS at Gardermoen, Bergen, Bodø and Tromsø, while SAS bought handling services from Braathens SAFE at Stavanger. The commission granted SAS the rights to fly from Oslo to Haugesund, Harstad/Narvik and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> Svalbard Airport, Longyear. Braathens SAFE was allowed to fly from Bergen to Northern Norway via Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund. SAS lost the right to fly directly from Bergen to Northern Norway. When the matter was passed by parliament, they also granted SAS the right to fly from Oslo to Stavanger, even if their planes did not continue abroad.|$|E
