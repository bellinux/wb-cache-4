40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) are an attractive potential material in nuclear power generation systems {{due to an}} excellent combination of corrosion resistance, strength, toughness, and affordability. <b>Thermal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> caused by phase instability in the temperature range of ~ 300 - 550 °C severely limits the service temperature of DSS. The rate of embrittlement varies markedly among commercial alloys. Specifically, alloys with high concentrations of Cr, Ni, and Mo are thought to demonstrate an enhanced rate of <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> The present study investigates a set of standard and lean grade wrought (2003, 2101, and 2205) and weld (2209 -w and 2101 -w) alloys {{in order to better}} understand how alloying elements affect <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> Samples were aged at 427 °C for up to 10, 000 hours, and the embrittlement was assessed via nanoindentation testing. Furthermore, the phase transformations were characterized with atom probe tomography. The results show that there are apparent compositional factors that greatly influence both the phase instability and the resulting embrittlement. The lean grade alloys demonstrated less hardening and embrittlement compared to the standard grade alloys. The reduced concentration of Mo and Ni in the lean grade alloys was found to be the most likely explanation for the reduced mechanical degradation...|$|E

The anisotropy in mechanical properties was addressed, as well as the alloy’s susceptibility to <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> Strong anisotropy was found in the material’s creep resistance at 725 °C for longer rupture times. Anisotropic behavior was also observed for the ductile–brittle transition temperature (DBTT). The origin of the anisotropy can be related to the strongly directional microstructure which enables a large amount of intergranular cracking during straining at both high and low temperatures. The DBTT of the alloy is very high, and can be further increased by at least 200 °C after 1000 h of ageing at 475 °C, due to the formation of the Cr-rich α´ phase. The particularly high susceptibility of the MA 956 to <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> is mainly a consequence of its high chromium content. JRC.

40|$|Abstract. CF 8 M cast {{austenitic}} stainless steel is used for several components such as primary coolant piping, pump casing, and valve bodies in light water reactors. Thermal aging results in spinodal decomposition of the delta-ferrite leading to increased strength and decreased toughness. Material properties depend on multiple variables including chemical composition, ferrite content, aging time, aging temperature and so on. Various algorithms {{have been developed to}} predict the results of these multiple variables, and studies to predict the results using artificial neural networks have been performed actively.

40|$|International audienceThermomechanical {{shaping of}} {{metallic}} glasses {{has previously been}} reported to result in severe <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> This phenomenon is most likely the reason why little effort {{has been made to}} exploit the mechanical properties of complex shapes attainable by thermomechanical shaping of metallic glass tapes and ribbons. The present study revealed time temperature windows in which metallic glasses can be shaped by thermal annealing while remaining fully ductile. These include binary (Fe(83) B(17), Co(80) B(20) and Pd(82) Si(18)), ternary (Fe(81. 5) B(14. 5) Si(4) and Cu(60) Zr(30) Al(10)) and more complex quaternary Zr(70) Ni(16) Cu(6) Al(8) glassy alloys of both metal metalloid and metal metal types.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{fracture}} toughness in steels, especially in low steels, in severely reduced by exposure at the temperature range of 350 - 575 {degrees}C through isothermal aging or slow cooling. It is also well recognized that segregation of impurities, such as Sb, P, Sn, As, along prior austenite grain boundaries is {{the main cause of}} thermal (temper) embrittlement. The most potent embrittling elements, in order of decreasing potency, are Sb, Sn, P, and As. However, Sb, Sn, and As are not generally present in steels. Therefore P is usually the most concerned element in steels. McMahon has concluded in his review that plain C steels containing less than 0. 5 wt% Mn are not susceptible to temper embrittlement.

Aging leads to increase in the hardness of delta-ferrite phase. The ferrite hardening was very rapid in the initial stages of aging; thereafter the hardness increase was more gradual at all the aging temperatures. Charpy impact test of the aged samples showed drastic decrease in impact toughness. The value of Charpy impact energy saturated after aging to 5000 h at all the aging temperatures. The embrittlement in the material is known to be caused by spinodal decomposition reaction in which the delta-ferrite decomposes into iron-rich a and chromium-enriched alpha'. For the purpose of non-destructive evaluation of <b>thermal</b> aging <b>embrittlement,</b> double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) test and anodic polarizations in acetic acid and HCl solution were carried out.

In contrast to the small effect on tensile properties, the impact toughness was significantly degraded after aging. Charpy impact test of the aged samples showed decrease in upper-shelf and lower-shelf energy and increase in ductile brittle transition temperature. Large increase in the microhardness of ferrite phase was observed with no change in austenite hardness. The embrittlement in 316 L weld was higher compared to 304 L weld for similar aging condition.

40|$|This {{research}} explores a novel {{application of}} catalytic membrane reactors for high- purity hydrogen extraction from bioethanol reforming. Conventional membrane systems employ hydrogen permselective {{materials such as}} palladium, polymer membranes, which present several material challenges including <b>embrittlement,</b> <b>thermal</b> degradation and poisoning by hydrocarbons when used for high-temperature hydrocarbon reforming. Thus, the present work is motivated by an interest in employing reactor design concepts to alleviate our reliance upon permselective materials. Catalytic membrane reactor with segregated reactant(s) is employed to demonstrate the hypothesis that high-purity hydrogen with competitive hydrogen recoveries {{can be achieved by}} manipulating the reaction and diffusion phenomena, and corresponding thermal gradients inside the catalytic membrane, {{in the absence of any}} permselective materials. The hypothesis is demonstrated in two designs: (1) a single functional layer design for water-gas-shift catalytic membrane reactor, and (2) a multi-layer design for bioethanol reforming. A two-dimensional model is developed to describe reaction and diffusion in the catalytic membrane coupled with plug-flow equations in the retentate and permeate volumes using shell and tube architecture. Simulation results for a typical diesel reformate mixture (9 mol% CO, 3 mol% CO 2, 28 mol% H 2 and 15 mol% H 2 O) demonstrate that H 2 :CO permselectivities of 90 : 1 to > 200 : 1 with permeate hydrogen recoveries of 20 % to 40 % can be achieved through appropriate catalytic membrane design. This single reaction simulation results are used to establish a clear rubric of design rules that are then used as a base for designing catalytic membrane reactor for extraction of hydrogen from bioethanol (16 mol% ethanol). The two-dimensional catalytic membrane reactor for bioethanol reforming is simulated, using a network of ethanol reforming reactions and a composite iicatalyst with unique catalytic layers active for one or more reactions. The isothermal simulation results show that an apparent H 2 :CO permselectivity of 100 : 1 with hydrogen recovery of 15 % can be achieved at appropriate design and flow configuration. This model is extended to a non-isothermal design, which predicted a decrease in membrane performance owing to endothermic reforming reaction. An autothermal design with an additional combustion catalyst layer to counteract the endothermic thermal gradients enhanced the non-isothermal membrane performance. Experiments were conducted to validate the water-gas-shift catalytic membrane reactor model using a gas permeation system; results qualitatively agree with the modeling results and quantitively with an error...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{second harmonic}} generation in Rayleigh surface waves propagating in 9 %Cr ferritic martensitic steel. Previous experimental {{results show that the}} nonlinearity parameter is sensitive to certain changes in a material's properties such as <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> and hardness changes. Therefore, the nonlinearity parameter can be used as an indicator of thermal damage due to changes in dislocation density and precipitations. The specimens are isothermally aged for different holding times to create progressive changes in the microstructure and obtain different levels of thermal aging damage. As aging progresses the dislocation density decreases and precipitations are formed; these microstructural evolutions lead to changes in the nonlinearity parameter β. Nonlinear ultrasonic experiments are conducted for each specimen using a wedge transducer for generation and an air-coupled transducer for detection of Rayleigh surface waves. The amplitudes of the first and second order harmonics are measured at different propagation distances, and these amplitudes are used to obtain the relative nonlinearity parameter for each specimen at different aging stages. Conclusions about microstructural changes are drawn based on the nonlinear Rayleigh surface wave measurement and complementary measurements including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rockwell HRC hardness. The results indicate that the nonlinearity parameter is very sensitive to the dislocation density and precipitate formation, and thus can be used to track the microstructural change in this material during the process of thermal aging.

In addition to this phase separation, ultra-fine Ni–Mn–Si–Cu-rich G-phase precipitates form at the α/α' interfaces in both alloys. For the 2101 alloy, Cu clusters act to form a nucleus, around which a Ni–Mn–Si shell develops during the precipitation process. For the 2205 alloy, the Ni and Cu atoms enrich simultaneously and no core–shell chemical distribution was found. This segregation phenomenon may arise from the exact Ni/Cu ratio inside the ferrite. After annealing for 10 000 h, the number density of the G-phase within the 2205 alloy was found to be roughly one order of magnitude higher than in the 2101 alloy. The G-phase precipitates have an additional deleterious effect on the <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> as evaluated by the Ashby–Orowan equation, which explains the discrepancy between the hardness and the rate of phase separation with respect to annealing time (Gladman T 1999 Mater. Sci. Tech. Ser. 15 30 – 36) ...|$|E

However, <b>thermal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> at intermediate homologous temperatures of 475 °C and below, limits upper service temperatures for many applications. New lean grade duplex alloys have improved thermal stability over standard grades and potentially increase the upper service temperature or the lifetime at a given temperature for this class of material. The present work compares the thermal stability of lean grade, alloy 2003, to standard grade, alloy 2205, through a series of isothermal agings between 260 °C and 482 °C for times between 1 and 10, 000 h. Aged samples were characterized by changes in microhardness and impact toughness. Additionally, atom probe tomography was performed to illustrate the evolution of the α–α' phase separation in both alloys at select conditions. Atom probe tomography confirmed that phase separation occurs via spinodal decomposition for both alloys, and identified the presence of Ni–Cu–Si–Mn–P clusters in alloy 2205, which may contribute to the embrittlement of this alloy. The impact toughness model predictions for the upper service temperature show that alloy 2003 may be viable for use in 288 °C applications for 80 -year service lifetimes based on a Charpy V-notch criteria of 47 J at room temperature. In comparison, alloy 2205 should be limited to 260 °C applications for the same room temperature toughness of 47 J...|$|E
