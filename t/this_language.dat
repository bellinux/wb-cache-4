Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|In 831, Mojmir I was baptized, and his Moravian state {{became a}} part of the Bavarian Passau diocese. Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as {{political}} independence from East Frankish influence, his successor Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor Michael III for missionaries. As a result, Cyril and Methodius arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To further their goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: Old Church Slavonic, which employed the Glagolitic alphabet created by them. They translated the Bible and other church texts into <b>this</b> <b>language,</b> thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic Eastern Orthodox churches.|$|E

5|$|Modern Macedonian language, a south Slavic language, is {{unrelated}} to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes.

The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in <b>this</b> <b>language</b> are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} major Mayan {{languages}} have been confidently identified in hieroglyphic texts, {{with at least}} one other language probably identified. An archaic language variety known as Classic Maya predominates in these texts, particularly in the Classic-era inscriptions of the southern and central lowland areas. <b>This</b> <b>language</b> is most closely related to the Ch'olan branch of the language family, modern descendants of which include Ch'ol, Ch'orti' and Chontal. Inscriptions in an early Yucatecan language (the ancestor of the main surviving Yucatec language) have also been recognised or proposed, mainly in the Yucatán Peninsula region and from a later period. Three of the four extant Maya codices are based on Yucatec. It has also been surmised that some inscriptions found in the Chiapas highlands region may be in a Tzeltalan language whose modern descendants are Tzeltal and Tzotzil. Other regional varieties and dialects are also presumed to have been used, but have not yet been identified with certainty.|$|E

However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in <b>this</b> <b>language.</b> Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>language</b> is {{not from}} the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct {{quotation}} from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
