5000|$|... 1863: The four-wheeled <b>turning</b> <b>roller</b> skate, or quad skate, {{with four}} wheels set in two {{side-by-side}} pairs (front and rear), was first designed, in New York City by James Leonard Plimpton {{in an attempt}} to improve upon previous designs. The skate contained a pivoting action using a rubber cushion that allowed the skater to skate a curve just by pressing his weight to one side or the other, most commonly by leaning to one side. It was a huge success, {{so much so that the}} first public roller skating rinks were opened in 1866, first in New York City by Plimpton in his furniture store and then in Newport, Rhode Island with the support of Plimpton. The design of the quad skate allowed easier turns and maneuverability, and the quad skate came to dominate the industry for more than a century.|$|E

40|$|Badminton {{shuttlecock}} {{is constructed}} of 16 goose feathers from a waterfowl with a hemispherical cork. The shuttlecock is light in mass (approximately 5. 2 g), {{with a highly}} specific air resistance. For professional badminton players, the highest initial speed of the shuttlecock by a smash shot exceeds over 80 m/s, which is the fastest speed in all ball sports. Generally, {{it is extremely difficult}} to get the shuttlecock to speeds of over 30 m/s with a launching machine without breaking the waterfowl feathers. In this study, a shuttlecock launching machine using two <b>turn</b> <b>rollers</b> for badminton exercises has been developed with a new launcher mechanism that includes an advanced holder device and a high rotational speed motor installed. In addition, a continuous launcher system which is able to discharge the 12 (maximum 96) shuttlecocks continuously at intervals of 1. 5 seconds was designed. The results of the launching experiments using the two roller-type badminton machine show that the machine can launch the shuttlecock at mean initial speeds of up to 81. 8 m/s, with a maximum flight distance of over 11 m. The standard deviation of the shot and lateral directions are approximately 0. 34 m and 0. 12 m, respectively. The launching performance of the badminton machine developed here has a performance far exceeding almost any commercial one, so the badminton machine can be used for harder practice by professional badminton players...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a novel robotic end-effector and {{a method for}} grasping deformable objects with undefined shapes and geometry, such as sacks and bags. The first prototype end-ef-fector, designed for applications in the U. S.

When the end-effector comes into contact with any portion of the deformable object, the <b>rollers</b> <b>turn</b> inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between the rollers. The rollers stop rotating when a graspable por-tion of the material/object is caught in between, allowing the ob-ject to be maneuvered by the robot. The object is released when the <b>rollers</b> <b>turn</b> outwardly. The end-effector described in this ar-ticle can grab and hold filled sacks from any point on the sack, re-gardless of the sack’s orientation.

40|$|Shuttlecock {{used in a}} {{badminton}} {{match is}} light in mass (around 5 grams), and is strongly influenced by air drag force. For professional badminton players, the highest initial speed of the shuttlecock exceeds 84 m/s (300 km/hr), which is the fastest speed for a ball, racket or projectile sports. The shuttlecocks are of two kinds: one of feather {{and one that is}} a synthetic shuttlecock. A feather shuttlecock is constructed of 16 goose feathers with a cork base mostly. Also, a synthetic shuttlecock is made of plastic or nylon with a cork. Both shuttlecocks are light and of a complicated shape, therefore, it is extremely difficult for the shuttlecock to be launched at speeds of more than 42 m/s without breaking the feather, even if the newest mechanical technology is used. In this study, new insertion equipment and the motion control system were proposed, and an exercise machine for badminton, used to project the shuttlecock at high speeds (over 42 m/s), has been developed. The mechanism of the shuttlecock launcher in this machine was achieved using the friction force between two <b>turn</b> <b>rollers</b> and the shuttlecock. The results of the launcher experiments using the badminton machine show that the machine can project the feather shuttlecock at the maximum flight distance of about 11. 5 m, with a standard error of about 0. 32 m and the highest initial speeds being 52. 8 m/s. In the case of the synthetic shuttlecock, this machine achieved the maximum flight distance of about 9. 7 m, and the highest speeds being 47. 8 m/s. © 2011 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction of included angle of ERSM threaded parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact of the conjugated thread turns and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change of included angle of threaded parts of the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which roller thread profile has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack of sharp thread turns on the screw, rollers and nut; thread <b>turn</b> of <b>roller</b> with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; thread <b>turn</b> of <b>roller</b> with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features. Concurrently, possible wear out of threaded surfaces of ERSM parts is taken into account. </p...|$|R
50|$|The first {{revolving}} {{stage in the}} western world was built by Karl Lautenschläger (1843-1906) in 1896 in Munich, Germany. Lautenschläger studied under Carl Brandt at the court theatre in Darmstad. From there he went to Munich, where he worked for 22 years and became the head machinist at the Royal theatre. He is known for his {{revolving stage}}, sometimes called the Lautenschläger stage, which later acquired the legacy of being called the new Shakespeare stage. The stage was installed at the Residenz Theatre for a performance of Don Giovanni, an opera by Wolfgang Mozart. The revolve at the Residenz Theatre was fifty feet in diameter and was raised slightly off of the regular stage floor. With the proscenium, a little less than a fourth of the revolve was visible to the audience. Lautenschläger used electricity to power the turntable, with the table <b>turning</b> on <b>rollers,</b> which ran on a circular track. This particular revolve was split into quarter sections and allowed four scenes to be set {{at the top of the}} show. The rotating stage allowed for depth, like landscapes with views in the distance and a more three-dimensional set in front of the walls of the revolve.|$|R
