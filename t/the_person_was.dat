Charlie chooses that person because {{he said that he}} heard <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{test for}} {{judicial}} review on matters not {{relating to the}} ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act is not dependent on the Minister's subjective satisfaction. Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> associated with criminal activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|From {{a survey}} by Devijver of persons whose origin can be determined, it appears that during the 1st century, the large {{majority}} (65%) of auxiliary prefects were of Italian origin. The Italian proportion dropped steadily, to 38% in the 2nd century, and 21% in the 3rd century. From the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54) only Roman knights were eligible to hold command of an auxiliary regiment. This status could be obtained either by birth (i.e. if <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of a}} hereditary Roman knight; or by attaining the property qualification (100,000 denarii, the equivalent of 400 years' gross salary for an auxiliary alaris); or by military promotion: the latter were the chief centurions of legions (centurio primus pilus) who would normally be elevated to equestrian rank by the emperor after completing their single-year term as primuspilus.|$|E

5|$|The Montalto faction {{transferred}} {{their support}} to Medici on 1 April, securing his election. Joyeuse had been seeking Medici's election throughout the conclave, and {{had managed to}} secure the support of Montalto for his candidate. Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested so loudly {{that he could be}} heard on the street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting the election of a candidate was useless once <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> elected pope. Upon his election, Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. His election made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E

On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} that the correct test in judicial review proceedings is an objective one continues to apply in cases not involving the Internal Security Act. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the Court of Appeal remarked that, following Chng Suan Tze, {{the power of the}} Minister for Home Affairs under section 30(a) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to order the preventive detention of a person was dependent on the Minister's objective, and not subjective, satisfaction that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> associated with criminal activities.|$|E

5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E

40|$|The major metaphorical {{themes in}} {{motivation}} are re-viewed and associated with psychological theories and characteristic research. The history of motivation is con-strued as reflecting two major metaphors: <b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> a machine, and <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> Godlike.
