In his book American Pictures (1977), a worldwide success, he contrasted these with photographs of the American elite, hoping to provide a basis for social reform.|$|E

Kinzie Kensington, <b>the</b> <b>socially</b> awkward FBI hacker from Saints Row: The Third becomes the White House's press secretary, often tasked with clearing up the mess {{left behind by the}} President's verbal missteps.

5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point <b>the</b> <b>socially</b> responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E

5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to <b>the</b> <b>socially</b> liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new party leader at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, and Hans Olav Syversen was elected to this position.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from <b>the</b> <b>socially</b> accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
5|$|The Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created {{a number of}} important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions. Following the instructions of the Wood's despatch of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with support from agencies, mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives. The efforts by leaders, Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and Kuriakose Elias Chavara towards aiding <b>the</b> <b>socially</b> discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches, {{led to the development of}} mass education in Kerala.|$|E

5|$|Within days, some of Kennedy's aides were urging McGovern {{to run in}} his place; their {{antipathy}} towards McCarthy {{and ideological}} opposition to Humphrey made them unwilling to support either candidate. McGovern delayed making a decision, making sure that Bobby's brother Ted Kennedy {{did not want to}} enter, and with his staff still concerned about the senator's own reelection prospects. Indeed, McGovern's voting had changed during 1968, with his ADA rating falling to 43 as he sought more middle-of-the-road stances. In late July, McGovern's decision became more complicated when his daughter Teresa was arrested in Rapid City on marijuana possession charges. She had led a troubled life since her teenage years, developing problems with alcohol and depression and suffering the consequences of a relationship with an unstable neighborhood boy. Based on a recently enacted strict state drugs law, Terry now faced a minimum five-year prison sentence if found guilty. McGovern was also convinced that <b>the</b> <b>socially</b> conservative voters of South Dakota would reject him due to his daughter's arrest. Charges against her were subsequently dropped due to a technically invalid search warrant.|$|E
