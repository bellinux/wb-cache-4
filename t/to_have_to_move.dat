25|$|From 1997 {{the flights}} were made subject {{to public service}} obligations. Widerøe won the first three-year contract. In the second contest in September 1999, Coast Air won the Florø contract. It {{introduced}} their two 46-seat ATR 42–300 aircraft. This caused Widerøe <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their base from Florø to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The company received NOK51 million annually, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2003. The bid was about NOK100 million lower than from Widerøe. All stopovers were thereby dropped. Coast Air flew four or five daily trips to both Bergen and Oslo. The demand for air travel dropped in 2001, and only 85,000 passengers flew with Coast Air to Florø, instead of the estimated 100,000, making the entire operation a loss for the company.|$|E

When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|The 18-foot (5.5m) high Roman wall {{enclosing}} the City put {{the fleeing}} homeless {{at risk of}} being shut into the inferno. Once the riverfront was on fire and the escape route cut off by boat, the only exits were the eight gates in the wall. During the first couple of days, few people had any notion of fleeing the burning City altogether. They would remove what they could carry of their belongings to the nearest [...] "safe house", in many cases the parish church or the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral, only <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> again hours later. Some moved their belongings and themselves [...] "four and five times" [...] in a single day. The perception of a need to get beyond the walls only took root late on the Monday, and then there were near-panic scenes at the narrow gates as distraught refugees tried to get out with their bundles, carts, horses, and wagons.|$|E

500|$|The {{district}} {{has changed over}} the years as various architectural designs have evolved to compliment it. [...] The boulevard was widened between 1909 and 1910 causing the Art Institute of Chicago Building <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the lions guarding its entrance back 12 feet. [...] At that time, the Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue intersection (the end of route 66) was known as [...] "route center". [...] Also at that time, the boulevard had no streets crossing it and extending eastward, and thus, the Jackson intersection was a T intersection. [...] This was still true in 1920 when the Michigan Avenue Bridge opened and increased traffic by connecting this boulevard with the Magnificent Mile and the community north of the Chicago River a quarter mile to the north of this district. [...] The Fountain of the Great Lakes (installed in 1913) was highly visible from route center. [...] Today, four streets cross Michigan Avenue within the district (in addition to its northern and southern endpoints at crossing streets). [...] Three of the four change names as they cross Michigan: eastbound East Monroe Street (100 south) becomes East Monroe Drive; eastbound East Jackson Boulevard (300 south) becomes East Jackson Drive; and two-way East Congress Parkway (500 south) becomes East Congress Drive as it crosses into Grant Park to the east. East Balbo Drive (700 south) does not change names as it crosses Michigan.|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

50|$|Horizontal gaze palsy with {{progressive}} scoliosis (HGPPS) is a {{very rare}} form of conjugate gaze palsy, appearing only in a few dozen families worldwide. HGPPS prevents horizontal movement of both eyes, causing people with this condition <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their head to see moving objects. In addition to the eye movement impairment, HGPPS is coupled with progressive scoliosis, although eye symptoms usually appear before scoliosis. HGPPS {{is caused by a}} mutation in the ROBO3 gene, which is important in cross-over of motor and sensory signals, preventing horizontal eye movement. In addition to the mutation, lesions in the midbrain and pons are common. This can also include a complete absence of a formation in the pons, the facial colliculus, which is responsible for some facial movements. The cause of progressive scoliosisin HGPPS and why HGPPS does not affect vertical gaze is unclear. Progressive scoliosis is normally treated with surgery.|$|E
5000|$|.....to {{reduce the}} number of clubs in Sydney, will be very hard for the League to {{implement}} given the long playing traditions of some of those clubs. In the long term, however, it is likely that Sydney {{is not going to be}} able to support eleven clubs as it does at present. Therefore in the long term this is the only viable solution. Sydney based clubs are going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to new areas, merge or be relegated from the League. This is going to be a painful process. In the long term I believe that the ARL should be looking to {{reduce the number}} of clubs in the National Competition to fourteen, thus allowing clubs to play two complete rounds. This will mean, assuming that only four new clubs are admitted from areas outside Sydney, that there will be only five clubs based in Sydney." ...|$|E
