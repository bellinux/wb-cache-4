5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses <b>that</b> <b>distinction,</b> turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Camet {{traveled}} to Navarreux in France {{to visit his}} old family home, where his father had studied both academics and fencing. While the victory at Amsterdam was considered a milestone in Argentine athletics at the time, Camet, as a substitute was often forgotten as a contributor by his contemporaries in the fencing community such as Oscar Viñas and Eugenio Peni, despite being a legitimate and official medal winner. He was always given credit by his teammates, however, even if they emphasized his position as a substitute on the team. Camet's father died on July 15, 1931, {{a few years after}} Carmelo's success at the Olympics. Carmelo subsequently married Elsie Muir and, in 1981, returned to Navarreux for a second visit. He lived {{the rest of his life}} in Buenos Aires. At the time of his death, on July 22, 2007, at the age of 102, he was believed to be the world's oldest living Olympic athlete, although <b>that</b> <b>distinction</b> actually belonged to Erna Sondheim.|$|E

5|$|Eleven other {{historical}} {{counties have}} existed in Massachusetts, most becoming defunct when their lands were {{absorbed into the}} colony of New Hampshire or the state of Maine, {{both of which were}} created out of territory originally claimed by Massachusetts colonists. The oldest counties still in Massachusetts are Essex County, Middlesex County, and Suffolk County, created in 1643 with the original Norfolk County which was absorbed by New Hampshire and bears no relation to the modern Norfolk County. When these counties were created, they were a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which would remain separate from the Plymouth Colony and that colony's counties until 1691. Hampden County, created in 1812, is the most recently created county still in Massachusetts, although Penobscot County, Maine bore <b>that</b> <b>distinction</b> until Maine broke off from Massachusetts in 1820. The majority of Massachusetts counties are named in honor of English place names, reflecting Massachusetts' colonial heritage.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher first sought {{public office}} in 1893, {{when he was}} elected to Edmonton Town Council. In an {{aldermanic}} race in which the top six candidates were elected, he gained the final spot. On his first term on council he sat on the Licensing, and Health & Relief committees. He was re-elected in 1894, again placing sixth of nine candidates. Once this term expired in 1896, Gallagher stayed out of politics for several months until mayor Herbert Charles Wilson resigned over a dispute involving town funds. It fell to the council to fill the mayor's position. Gallagher was nominated by John Cameron and John Kelly; as there were no rival candidates, he won by acclamation. He was the first mayor of Edmonton never to be elected to that position; (Frederick John Mitchell and Terry Cavanagh would later join him in <b>that</b> <b>distinction).</b> He was sworn in at the town council meeting on October 27, 1896.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc panels on the exterior {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc on the exterior were later changed to stainless steel due to costs.

The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service.

Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1820s, Oregon City {{developed}} near Willamette Falls. It {{was incorporated}} in 1844, {{becoming the first}} city west of the Rocky Mountains to have <b>that</b> <b>distinction.</b> John McLoughlin, a Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) official, {{was one of the}} major contributors to the founding of the town in 1829. McLoughlin attempted to persuade the British government (which still held sway over the area) to allow American settlers to live on the land, and provided significant help to American colonization of the area, all against the HBC's orders. Oregon City prospered because of the paper mills that were run by the water power of Willamette Falls, but the falls formed an impassable barrier to river navigation. Linn City (originally Robins Nest) was established across the Willamette from Oregon City.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes <b>that</b> <b>distinction</b> to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} Flyers to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs <b>that</b> <b>distinction</b> would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
