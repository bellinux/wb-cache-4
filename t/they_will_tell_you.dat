Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
2500|$|Some on {{the left}} have also accused ANSWER of exaggerating protest attendance. [...] An October 2007 Socialist Worker {{editorial}} penned by Todd Chretien and republished on CounterPunch asserted: [...] "Ask anyone {{who has worked with}} ANSWER, and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that its organizers always double the number of people at their marches. More recently, the multiplication factor has increased." [...] Chretien describes this as [...] "disorienting for the movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews in the {{conservative}} press were more mixed. American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in Human Events, [...] "The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel." [...] The Weekly Standard senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film [...] "gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding", that it is [...] "fast-paced" [...] {{when compared with the}} original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is [...] "at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957." [...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E

But you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the Eagle House, and then you can have the story at your ease.

60|$|Friend, dost thou speak this as from thy own knowledge, or did {{any other}} <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> so? However, that spirit that led thee out this way, is a lying spirit.

And I trust that the Lord Jesus, who hath helped me to reject the wages of unrighteousness hitherto, will also help me still, so that I shall {{distribute}} that which God hath given me freely, and not for filthy lucre's sake.

60|$|Men {{and women}} who remain quietly at home do not, perhaps, fully realise this fact. Five weeks to them does not usually seem either very long or very short.

The aim of the project is to collect reminiscences from senior anthro­pologists regarding their experiences in pre-and post-World War II Plains archaeology, biological anthropology, and ethnology. The historian John Lukacs (1966 :x) once offered an elegant and concise comment {{on the value of}} history, one that I offer here: "I believe that history, as a form of thought, {{is one of the most}} precious and perhaps unique rational posssessions of Western civilizations. The character of a person may appear best from the reconstruc­tion of the history of his life; the same is true of the character of nations. The very history of a prob­lem may reveal its essential diagnosis. There is no human endeavor that may not be approached and studied profitably through its history. " Fortunately, there hardly needs to be a justification anymore for such a project, as is attested by the recent prolifera­tion of research into the history of archaeology and anthropology on virtually a global scale. The intention of these retrospective articles is not to explore or diagnose any particular problem but rather to create a mosaic of first person narrratives informed by personal experience and illustrated with photos and anecdotes to illuminate the development of Plains anthropology in the 20 th Century. <br /...|$|R

Confessions of this kind from a madman are generally true; their cunning is prodigious, and as long as they wish to conceal a fact it is next to impossible to get it from them; but when, as in the present case, they are proud of their cleverness and of the success with which they have fooled other people, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> everything. <b>You</b> see their ideas of right and wrong are entirely upset; the real lunatic is unconscious of having committed a crime, and is inclined even to glory in it." ...|$|R

6000|$|Also (it may be {{necessary}} to explain) I do not mean [...] "high planes" [...] such as the Theosophists and the Higher Thought Centres talk about.

[...] I do not mean this sort of height either. My religion says nothing about such planes except that all men are on one plane and that by no means a high one. There are saints indeed in my religion: but a saint only means a man who really knows he is a sinner.|$|R
