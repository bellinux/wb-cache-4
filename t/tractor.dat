5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered general purpose <b>tractor</b> in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall <b>tractor</b> marked a major {{point in the}} replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
