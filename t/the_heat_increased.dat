60|$|The sun {{cleared the}} eastern ramparts, and the coolness of morning fled as if before a magic foe. The whole desert changed. The grays wore bright; the mesquites glistened; the cactus took the silver hue of frost, and the rocks gleamed gold and red. Then, as <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased,</b> a wind rushed {{up out of}} the valley behind Gale, and the hotter the sun blazed down the swifter rushed the wind. The {{wonderful}} transparent haze of distance lost its bluish hue for one with tinge of yellow. Flying sand made the peaks dimly outlined.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{as the day}} grew, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> {{until it}} was so intense that the hot air danced above the sand slopes like billions of midges, and this {{although}} the sun was not visible, being hidden by a sort of mist. A strange silence, unusual even in the desert, pervaded the earth and sky; {{we could hear the}} grains of sand trickling from the ridges. The Zeus, who accompanied us, grew uneasy, and pointed upward with their spears, then behind toward the oasis of which we had long lost sight. Finally, when we were not looking, they disappeared.|$|E

5000|$|Higher {{clock rates}} and {{voltages}} increase power consumption, also increasing electricity cost and <b>heat</b> production. <b>The</b> additional <b>heat</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> ambient air temperature {{within the system}} case, which may affect other components.

60|$|A third {{hypothesis}} was, {{that the}} rising {{of the water}} was occasioned by the melting of the snows in summer on the mountains from which {{the sources of the}} river came. Against this supposition Herodotus found more numerous and more satisfactory reasons even than he had advanced against the others. In the first place the river came from the south--a direction in which <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> in intensity with every league, as far as travelers had explored it; and beyond those limits, they supposed that the burning sun made the country uninhabitable. It was preposterous to suppose that there could be snow and ice there. Then, besides, the Nile had been ascended to a great distance, and reports from the natives had been brought down from regions still more remote, and no tidings had ever been brought of ice and snow. It was unreasonable, therefore, to suppose that the inundations could arise from such a cause.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, we were as miserable as nature could well make us to be, for we were upon a voyage and no voyage, we were bound somewhere and nowhere; for though {{we knew what}} we {{intended}} to do, we did really not {{know what we were}} doing. We went forward and forward by a northerly course, and as we advanced <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased,</b> which began to be intolerable to us, who were on the water, without any covering from heat or wet; besides, we were now in the month of October, or thereabouts, in a southern latitude; and as we went every day nearer the sun, the sun came also every day nearer to us, till at last we found ourselves in the latitude of 20 degrees; and having passed the tropic about five or six days before that, in a few days more the sun would be in the zenith, just over our heads.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> Witta spread a cloth on bent sticks above the rowers, for the wind failed between the Island of the Mountain and the shore of Africa, which is east of it. That shore is sandy, and we rowed along it within three bowshots. Here we saw whales, and fish {{in the shape of}} shields, but longer than our ship. Some slept, some opened their mouths at us, and some danced on the hot waters. The water was hot to the hand, and the sky was hidden by hot, grey mists, out of which blew a fine dust that whitened our hair and beards of a morning. Here, too, were fish that flew in the air like birds. They would fall on the laps of the rowers, and when we went ashore we would roast and eat them.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cold start}} system has a solenoid valve and a glow {{filament}} which are connected in series. When starting the engine, diesel fuel comes through the solenoid valve and gets <b>heated</b> at <b>the</b> glow filament, the diesel fuel evaporates.

5000|$|Cotton and linen. When these {{materials}} {{come into contact}} with polyunsaturated vegetable oils (linseed, massage oils), bacteria slowly decompose <b>the</b> materials, producing <b>heat.</b> If {{these materials}} are stored in a way so <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> cannot escape, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> buildup <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> rate of decomposition and thus <b>the</b> rate of <b>heat</b> buildup <b>increases.</b> Once ignition temperature is reached, combustion occurs with oxidizers present (oxygen).|$|R

6000|$|A vague fear of pursuit {{made him}} {{continue}} his course many hours without resting. The desert again became sandy, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased.</b> The breeze that plays about the wilderness, and {{in early spring}} is often scented with the wild fragrance of aromatic plants, sank away. A lurid brightness suffused the heavens. An appalling stillness pervaded nature; even the insects were silent. For {{the first time in}} his pilgrimage, a feeling of deep despondency fell over the soul of Alroy. His energy appeared suddenly to have deserted him. A low hot wind began to rise, and fan his cheek with pestiferous kisses, and enervate his frame with its poisonous embrace. His head and limbs ached with a dull sensation, more terrible than pain; his sight was dizzy, his tongue swollen. Vainly he looked around for aid; vainly he extended his forlorn arms, and wrung them to the remorseless heaven, almost frantic with thirst. The boundless horizon of the desert disappeared, and the unhappy victim, in the midst of his torture, found himself apparently surrounded by bright and running streams, the fleeting waters of the false mirage! ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the summer}} {{advanced}} <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased,</b> and the mosquitoes became perfectly insupportable. Nothing could save {{one from the}} attacks of these little torments. Almost all other insects went to rest with the sun: sand-flies, which bite viciously during the day, went to sleep at night; the large bull-dog, whose bite is terrible, slumbered in the evening; but the mosquito, the long-legged, determined, vicious, persevering mosquito, whose ceaseless hum dwells for ever on the ear, never went to sleep. Day and night the painful, tender little pimples on our necks and behind our ears were being constantly retouched by these villainous flies, it was useless killing thousands of them-- millions supplied their place. The only thing, in fact, that can protect one during the night (nothing can during the day) is a net of gauze hung over the bed; but as this was looked upon by the young men as somewhat effeminate, it was seldom resorted to. The best thing for their destruction, we found, was to fill our rooms with smoke, either by burning damp moss or by letting off large puffs of gunpowder, and then throwing {{the doors and windows}} open to allow them to fly out. This, however, did not put them all out; so we generally spent an hour or so before going to bed in hunting them with candles. Even this did not entirely destroy them; and often might our friends, by looking telescopically through the keyhole, have seen us wandering during the late hours of the night in our shirts looking for mosquitoes, like unhappy ghosts doomed to search perpetually for something they can never find. The intense, suffocating heat also added greatly to our discomfort.|$|E
50|$|As {{the weeks}} {{went on and}} <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased,</b> the first enthusiasm for manual labour was less evident. The Bekaa valley, the men found, was a natural wind funnel.

The tempo of the work slackened considerably.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} {{to take note of}} <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> <b>heat</b> in <b>the</b> piping system, which in turn increases system pressure.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain the heat {{dissipation}} regularity of heavy-duty vertical lathe workbench with a large radius, mathematical model of convection heat transfer is established. According to the model, convection heat transfer process of the workbench is analysed at the velocity of 10 ~ 80 rpm. The results show that velocity increasing not only impacts a greater influence on the temperature rising of hydrostatic bearing than the temperature rising of workbench, but also drives <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> the heat dissipation, degenerated the heat concentration phenomenon. Experimental results shows consistent to the workbench temperature numerical simulation results, the maximum error is 5 %, which indicating that the numerical results conform physical regularities, the heat transfer mathematical model extends the range of applications of rotation convection heat transfer, so that vertical lathe heat dissipation situation analysis can be easier and more accurate...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fatigue, {{moisture}} conditioning, and heating on the residual tension strengths of center-cracked graphite/epoxy buffer strip panels were evaluated using specimens made with T 300 / 5208 graphite epoxy in a 16 -ply quasi-isotropic layup, with two different buffer strip materials, Kevlar- 49 or S-glass. It was found that, for panels subjected to fatigue loading, the residual strengths {{were not significantly}} affected by the fatigue loading, the number of repetitions of the loading spectrum, or the maximum strain level. The moisture conditioning reduced the residual strengths of the S-glass buffer strip panels by 10 to 15 percent below the ambient results, but increased the residual strengths of the Kevlar- 49 buffer strip panels slightly. For both buffer strip materials, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> the residual strengths of the buffer strip panels slightly over the ambient results...|$|E
40|$|The reactor {{pressure}} vessel (RPV) {{represents one of the}} most important safety components in a nuclear power plant. Therefore, surveillance specimen (SS) programs for the RPV material exist to deliver a reliable assessment of RPV residual lifetime. This report will present neutron fluence calculations for SS. These calculations were carried out by the codes TRAMO [1] and DORT [2]. This study was accompanied by ex-vessel neutron dosimetry experiments at Kola NPP. The main neutron activation monitoring reactions were 54 Fe(n,p) 54 Mn and 58 Ni(n,p) 58 Co. Good agreement was found between the deterministic and stochastic calculation results and between the calculations and the ex-vessel measurements. The different influences on the monitors were studied. In order to exclude the possible healing effects of the samples due to excessive temperatures, the heat release in the surveillance specimens was determined based on the calculated gamma fluences.

40|$|This paper {{stems from}} a project to {{complement}} present condition monitoring techniques for offshore wind turbine drive trains by thermal imaging. In a first test setup, fully covered spherical roller bearings have been monitored. A methodology for analysing the thermal measurements is presented and applied for both healthy and faulty bearings. Independent of the ambient temperature, a bearing with inner raceway fault shows faster and higher temperature increase than the healthy bearing. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increase</b> does not further propagate through the shaft, revealing the potential of thermal imaging for both fault detection and localization for drive train components...|$|R

30|$|During each experiment, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> flux was <b>increased</b> in {{discrete}} steps (25 to 50 kW/m 2) {{up to the}} CHF.

Since the typical timescale for a bubble nucleation cycle is tens of milliseconds, 2.0 s is sufficient to obtain good data statistics. Near <b>the</b> critical <b>heat</b> flux, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> flux was <b>increased</b> in smaller increments (10 to 25 kW/m 2) to ensure higher accuracy in capturing the CHF event.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of buoyancy and Coriolis forces on heat transfer in turbine blade internal coolant passages. The experiments {{were conducted}} with a large scale, multipass, heat transfer model with both radially inward and outward flow. Trip strips on the leading and trailing surfaces of the radial coolant passages were used to produce the rough walls. An analysis of the governing flow equations showed that four parameters influence the heat transfer in rotating passages: coolant-to-wall temperature ratio, Rossby number, Reynolds number, and radius-to-passage hydraulic diameter ratio. The first three of these four parameters were varied over ranges which are typical of advanced gas turbine engine operating conditions. Results were correlated and compared to previous results from stationary and rotating similar models with trip strips. The heat transfer coefficients on surfaces, where <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> with rotation and buoyancy, varied by as much as a factor of four. Maximum values of the heat transfer coefficients with high rotation were only slightly above the highest levels obtained with the smooth wall model. The heat transfer coefficients on surfaces, where the heat transfer decreased with rotation, varied by as much as a factor of three due to rotation and buoyancy. It was concluded that both Coriolis and buoyancy effects must be considered in turbine blade cooling designs with trip strips and that the effects of rotation were markedly different depending upon the flow direction...|$|E
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that increased plasma or serum concentrations of extracellular heat shock proteins (eHSP) {{serve as a}} danger signal to the innate immune system. Cellular binding of eHSP leads to activation of NK cells and monocytes, as measured by their increased cytokine production, mitotic division and killing capacity. We examined whether eHSP binds to NK lymphocytes in vivo in athletes performing endurance exercise in the heat. Eighteen trained male runners ran at 70 % VO 2 max at 35 degrees C and 40 % relative humidity. Venous blood collected before, after and 1. 5 h after exercise was analysed for leukocyte distribution, phenotype and eHSP 70. NK cell-enriched samples were examined for co-localization of CD 94 and eHSP 70 expression. Plasma eHSP- 70 concentration was measured by ELISA. Subjects ran for approximately 50 min, which elicited a reversible leukocytosis. NK cell count increased 83 % (p < 0. 01) immediately after exercise, then decreased to 66 % of the resting level 1. 5 h after exercise (p < 0. 05). Plasma eHSP concentration increased 167 % after exercise and remained elevated (by up to 71 %) 1. 5 h after exercise (p < 0. 01). eHSP was expressed on both NK cells and monocytes at all times; the count of NK cells positive for eHSP doubled from 0. 04 +/- 0. 02 10 (9) /L (mean +/- SD) to 0. 08 +/- 0. 06 10 (9) /L after exercise. In summary, exercise in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> free plasma eHSP concentration, and the eHSP co-localized with CD 94 on NK cells.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the acute and chronic effects of euhydrated and hypohydrated heat exposure, on biomarkers of stress and inflammation. Eight trained males [mean (SD) age: 21 (3) y; mass: 77. 30 (4. 88) kg; V̇O 2 max: 56. 9 (7. 2) mL·kg− 1 ·min− 1] undertook two heat acclimation programmes (balanced cross-over design), once drinking to maintain euhydration and once with restricted fluid-intake (permissive dehydration). Days 1, 6, and 11 were 60 min euhydrated exercise-heat stress tests (40 °C; 50 % RH, 35 % peak power output), days 2 – 5 and 7 – 10 were 90 min, isothermal-strain (target rectal temperature: 38. 5 °C) exercise-heat sessions. Plasma was obtained pre- and post- exercise on day 1, 2, and 11 and analysed for cortisol, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Cortisol and CRP were also assessed on day 6. IL- 6 was elevated following the initial (acute) 90 minute isothermal heat strain exercise-heat exposure (day 2) with permissive dehydration ((pre exercise: 1. 0 pg. mL- 1 [0. 9], post-exercise: 1. 8 pg. mL- 1 [1. 0], P = 0. 032) and when euhydrated (pre-exercise: 1. 0 pg. mL- 1 [1. 4], post-exercise: 1. 6 pg. mL- 1 [2. 1], P = 0. 048). Plasma cortisol levels were also elevated but only during permissive dehydration (P = 0. 032). Body mass loss was strongly correlated with Δcortisol (r = - 0. 688, P = 0. 003). Although there was a trend for post-exercise cortisol to be decreased following both heat acclimation programmes (chronic effects), there were no within or between intervention differences in IL- 6 or CRP. In conclusion, acute exercise in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>increased</b> IL- 6 and cortisol only when fluid-intake is restricted. There were no chronic effects of either intervention on biomarkers of inflammation as evidenced by IL- 6 and CRP returning to basal level {{at the end of}} heat acclimation...|$|E
