5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E
