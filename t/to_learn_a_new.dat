5|$|Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a {{combination}} between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system {{that is used to}} increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E

Most inventory management software includes training manuals and other information available to users. Despite its apparent complexity, inventory management software offers a degree of stability to companies. For example, if an IT employee in charge of the system leaves the company, a replacement can be comparatively inexpensive to train compared to if the company used multiple programs to store inventory data.|$|R

25|$|Australasian Signed English {{was created}} in the late 1970s to {{represent}} English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was, and still is, used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for discussing English in academic contexts. It was thought to be much easier for hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language. Some research points to the possibility that the difficulty of learning a second language may be derived from the structural patterns and language cues that one has already picked up from his or her acquisition of first language. In that sense, the knowledge of and skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.|$|E
25|$|Relevant {{evidence}} suggests that Eleanor was not fluent in English, but was accustomed to read, and so presumably to think and speak, in French, her mother's tongue, with which {{she would have been}} familiar from childhood despite spending her early years in Spain. In this she was luckier than many medieval European queens, who often arrived in their husband's realms to face the need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language; but the English court was still functionally bilingual, in large measure through the long succession of its queens, who were mostly from French-speaking lands. In 1275, on a visit to St Albans abbey in Hertfordshire, the people of the town begged her help in withstanding the abbot's exactions from them, but one of her courtiers had to act as translator before she could respond to the plea for assistance. All the literary works noted above are in French, as are the bulk of her surviving letters, and since Peckham wrote his letters and his angelic treatise for her in French, she was presumably well known to prefer that language.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Vigoda, a {{reporter}} for The Philadelphia Inquirer, has speculated that {{the completion of the}} Transcontinental Railroad {{may have contributed to the}} alphabet's downfall: non-Mormons, not loyal to Brigham Young, became a large part of the city, and without the religious motivation it would be difficult indeed to get them <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> alphabet. In a retrospective piece, historian A. J. Simmonds claims that the new railroad doomed the alphabet. According to him, easy access to [...] "the whole literature of the English speaking world" [...] rendered the alphabet useless.|$|E

Several months after Tibor's birth the family moved to Čenej (now in Serbia), where Tibor lived until he was ten years old. [...] While Hungarian was his [...] "mother tongue", the {{commonly}} spoken language was German. Sekelj had at least two sisters and a brother, Antonije, who later collaborated with him on several books. In 1922, the family settled in Kikinda, part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), where Tibor learned Serbo-Croatian. He also studied French and soon was teaching it to his fellow students. Sekelj went on <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language every four years. In 1926 his family moved to Nikšić (now in Montenegro), where he took up gym, mountaineering and where he walked the entire length of Montenegro. [...] In 1929 he entered the University of Zagreb (in Croatia) and in 1933 was one of the three youngest students to have graduated from the school of law. [...] During that time Tibor also studied painting, sculpture, Esperanto, filmmaking and journalism. [...] But the practice of law bored him, and he turned his attention to writing. He began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1937 he started to work in Zagreb as a film screenwriter. In 1982, in Leuven, Belgium, at the World Youth Esperanto Conference, he discussed his Sephardic Jewish ancestry with Neil Blonstein.|$|E

40|$|Sparse {{representations}} of images in overcomplete bases (i. e., redundant dictionaries) have many applications in computer vision and image processing. Recent works have demonstrated improvements in image representations by <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> dictionary from training data {{instead of using}} a predefined one.

This paper proposes <b>a</b> <b>new</b> approach, termed active screening, to overcome this challenge. Active screening sequentially selects subsets of training samples using a simple heuristic and adds the selected samples to a “learning pool, ” which is then used <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> dictionary for improved representation performance. The performance of the proposed active dictionary learning approach is evaluated through numerical experiments on real-world image data; the results of these experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

60|$|An {{illustration}} {{may serve}} to render clearer this fundamental and important distinction. If at the present day a body of Englishmen were to settle in China, they might learn and use the Chinese names for many native plants, animals, and manufactured articles; but however many of such words they adopted into their vocabulary, their language would still remain essentially English. A visitor from England would have to learn a number of unfamiliar words, {{but he would not}} have <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language. If, on the other hand, a body of Frenchmen were to settle in a neighbouring Chinese province, and to adopt exactly the same Chinese words, their language would still remain essentially French. The dialects of the two settlements would contain many words in common, but neither of them would be a Chinese dialect on that account. Just so, English since the Norman Conquest has grafted many foreign words upon the native stock; but it still remains at bottom the same language as in the days of Eadgar.|$|E
