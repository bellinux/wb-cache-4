40|$|Abstract only. Many {{renewable}} resources, such as fish stocks, {{water or}} environmental quality, are shared between different countries. The management of such resources then relies on international agreements. We develop {{a model of}} a shared renewable resource for which there is an international agreement that determines each country's share of total extractions. The government of each country is responsible for the enforcement of their national quota. Governments seek to maximize the value of their country's share of the resource, but also care about sustainability (compliance with <b>total</b> <b>quota).</b> Lowering the level of national enforcement gives firms stronger incentives to violate their quotas. Consequently, even with a sharing agreement in place and national quotas set according to the agreement, the countries can cheat on the agreement by reducing enforcement efforts and thereby inducing its firms to violate their quotas. We analyze the effects of this in a differential game framework. There are two games. First, a Stackelberg game {{between the government and the}} extraction firms in each country, which determines national extraction. Second, an enforcement game at the international level between different governments, which determines total extraction. Our results suggest that if the <b>total</b> <b>quota</b> is too low, countries will have an incentive to cheat on the agreement by reducing enforcement efforts. Overly restrictive <b>total</b> <b>quotas</b> may in fact be counterproductive. In this case, the equilibrium resource stock increases as the <b>total</b> <b>quota</b> is increased. Imposing a less restrictive quota removes the incentive to cheat. We obtain a bound on the <b>total</b> <b>quota</b> that must be met for cheating to be eliminated...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of modern resource management in post-war fishery policies involved a strict regulation regime for fisheries. Among the measures are limited entry, the {{introduction of}} <b>total</b> allowable <b>quota</b> (TAC) and individual vessel quotas in addition to technical regulations for the execution of fishing. Also, institutional measures to reduce overcapacity are established. However, the management of shrimp trawling fisheries in the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and in the Fisheries Protection Zone around Svalbard provides exceptions to this management regime. No TAC is established and the fleet is not restricted by vessel quotas. During recent {{years there has been}} a massive increase in catch capacity and the management authorities have suggested <b>total</b> <b>quotas</b> as a new management strategy. An introduction of <b>total</b> <b>quotas</b> involves a number of potential conflicts at different levels; it creates allocation problems across nations and internal allocation problems in the Norwegian shrimp fleet. This article presents the driving forces behind the increase in capacity, a process that stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} government's expressed goal to prevent overcapacity. With no TAC and the absence of allocation at different levels, it is difficult to monitor the capacity development. An assessment of various allocation models shows that the problem of overcapacity first becomes evident when <b>total</b> <b>quotas</b> and allocation are put on the agenda. The question now, is whether the increase in capacity has made the established system outdated and if this calls for new solutions. Capacity expansion Quota regulations Shrimp trawling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Even {{with the}} rapid changes {{in the level of}} {{complexity}} and the uncertainty of the environment in which Belgian sea fisheries operate, fisheries management in Belgium is still mainly based on restrictive policy instruments founded in the biological approach of fisheries management science. Since they will continue to play an important role, this paper evaluated changes in three restrictive policy instruments and their effect on future fleet performance and dynamics, i. e. maximum fishing days, total quota-restrictions and licences. These effects are tested through scenarios in a microeconomic simulation model, including sensitivity analysis. This study opts for a dynamic simulation model based on a microeconomic approach of fleet dynamics using system dynamics as a modelling technique (operational base: Vensimr©DSS). The results indicated that changes in maximum fishing days and <b>total</b> <b>quota</b> resulted in higher fluctuations in fleet performance and dynamics compared to changes in licences. Furthermore, changes in maximum fishing days and <b>total</b> <b>quota</b> had a direct impact on fleet performance, though not always as expected, whereas licences only affected fleet performance indirectly since they only limit the entry of new vessels to the fleet and they can block the growth of successful sub fleets. The outcomes of this study are translated into practical recommendations for improving fisheries management. Firstly, policy makers need to be more aware of misperceptions of feedback...|$|R

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{reports on}} an {{economic}} experiment {{conducted to examine}} the nature of rent dissipation in limited entry fisheries with aggregate quotas, and factors affecting fishermen's political support for changing to individual quota management. The experimental subjects are fishermen who participate {{in a series of}} fishing seasons. The experiment assumes that (a) managers limit aggregate harvests each season to a total quota; (b) individual fishermen's shares of the total catch are positively related to their share of total fishing expenditures; (c) individual fishermen's shares of the total catch are positively related to their assigned fishing skill, and (d) rents are dissipated to the extent that total expenditures exceed the minimum necessary to catch the <b>total</b> <b>quota.</b> <b>Total</b> <b>quotas</b> and fish prices which together determine the catch value vary between seasons. After only a few seasons, subjects dissipate almost all potential rents by increasing expenditures to try to increase their shares of the rents. Increases in prices lead to increased rent dissipation; lower prices lead to reduced rent dissipation. Heterogeneity of fishing skill reduces the extent of rent dissipation, as fishing becomes relatively less profitable for less skilled participants. More skilled participants capture significant rents. After gaining experience with a fishery without individual quotas, subjects vote on whether to switch to individual quota (IQ) management. Subjects are more likely to vote for individual quotas the higher their quota allocations. Heterogeneity of fishing skill, by increasing the heterogeneity of catches and the rents captured by skilled fishermen without IQs, reduces the likelihood that IQ allocations based on historical catches will be supported by a majority of fishermen. Implementation of IQs quickly reduces rent dissipation to almost zero...|$|R

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Seafish has {{undertaken}} an economic impact assessment (EIA) {{of the landing}} obligation for key UK fleets targeting demersal stocks. The purpose of the EIA is to provide information that supports decision-making and understanding at a fleet segment, home nation and national level. The EIA has been undertaken in two phases: choke analysis and bioeconomic scenario analysis. The choke analysis provides a view of what the activity of six UK fleet segments {{would have been in}} 2013 had the proposed rules for the landing obligation in 2016 and 2019 been in place. This provides a high level, worst case snapshot of choke stocks by fleet indicating how many days fishing could have been achieved in 2013 before the primary choke stock quota was exhausted. The analysis is performed for each major sea area surrounding the UK. Following on from the choke analysis, the scenario analysis answers the question, what are the potential outcomes for the fleet from the introduction of various landing obligation policy levers? The model includes policy levers such as exemptions (de minimis and surviviability), derogations (inter-species flexibility) and quota uplift (top-up) and considers two views of <b>quota</b> <b>held</b> by fleet: initial quota allocation and end of year <b>quota</b> <b>held</b> (approximated by landings).

40|$|Cross-border {{passengers}} from Hong Kong to Shenzhen by the east Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR) through the Lo Wu customs exceed nearly 200 thousand {{on a special}} day such as a day during the Chinese Spring Festival. Such heavy passenger demand often exceeds the processing and holding capacity of the Lo Wu customs for many hours a day. Thus, passengers must be metered off at all entrance stations along the KCR line through ticket rationing to restrain the number of passengers waiting at Lo Wu within its safe holding capacity. This paper proposes an optimal control strategy and model {{to deal with this}} passenger crowding and control problem. Because the maximum passenger checkout rate at Lo Wu is fixed, total passenger waiting time is not affected by the control strategy for given time-dependent arriving rates at each station. An equity-based control strategy is thus proposed to equalize the waiting times of passengers arriving at all stations at the same time. This equity is achieved through optimal allocation of the <b>total</b> <b>quota</b> of tickets to all entrance stations for each train service. The <b>total</b> ticket <b>quota</b> for each train service is determined such that the capacity constraint of the passenger queue at Lo Wu is satisfied.
