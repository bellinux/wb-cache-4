5|$|Clinical {{social worker}} Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) aids a family as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{terms with the}} incestuous abuse they have {{suffered}} for decades. However, the father who is responsible still commands respect and political connections in the area, making the case a difficult one.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> shore to molt.|$|E

60|$|Passing {{along for}} some {{distance}} <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> another strong oaken door. This, like the last, yielded {{to the efforts}} of the crowbars of the foresters, and they again advanced. Presently <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a flight of steps.|$|R
60|$|All were willing, {{and soon}} the {{vicinity}} was left far behind. Then <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> where a fair sized brook flowed into Bass Lake, and here <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> anchor and began to fish, while Powell took several photographs.|$|R
5|$|Some years later, Peg Boggs, a local Avon {{door-to-door}} saleswoman, {{visits the}} decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone and offers {{to take him}} to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her family: her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Despite their initial fear of Edward, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see him as a kind person.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the {{television}} series Lost commenced airing in the United States and Canada on September 22, 2004, concluded on May 25, 2005, and contained 25 episodes. It introduces the 48 survivors of a plane that broke apart in mid-air, scattering them on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific. Forced {{to work together to}} survive, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realize it is no ordinary island.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
5000|$|Afterwards <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a {{headland}} and {{a multitude}} of wild animals; and this headland appeared {{as if it might}} be a cake of cow-dung, because the animals passed the winter there.

60|$|Their {{course at}} first lay over a level {{part of the}} plain, which {{rendered}} full speed possible; then <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a part where the thick grass grew rank and high, rendering the work severe. As the sun rose high, <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a small pond, or pool.|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When Mulder and Scully are called to New York to {{investigate}} {{the death of a}} police officer, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> believe that a young girl present at the incident may be the reincarnation of another officer murdered years earlier.|$|E
5|$|These {{are highly}} pelagic birds with long, narrow wings and tube-shaped nostrils. They feed at sea on fish, squid and other marine life. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> land to breed in colonies, nesting in burrows or on cliffs. There are about 77 species worldwide, {{two of which}} are rare vagrants to Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|They become {{tired of}} each other's company, {{and of the}} food they have brought. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a ruinous summer pasture village, and eat local food: boiled milk, the yellow crust that forms on cream, and fresh bread. They catch sight of their goal, Mir Samir. They find tracks of ibex and wolf. One of their drivers catches a snowcock by running after it.|$|E

5|$|Eladio {{returns to}} see Gabrielle, {{but by now}} has grown {{deformed}} from the fungus. Gabrielle, afraid of him, gives him her money and lies to the agents about his location when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see her. In actuality, Eladio {{has returned to the}} camp where Maria died, where Lozano tries to spur Soledad on in killing his brother. Soledad finds he can't do it, and Lozano struggles with him, being accidentally killed when the gun goes off. Soledad becomes a carrier of the fungal growth himself and flees with Eladio towards Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{the ground to}} eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

5|$|The Alexander Stadium in Perry Barr is the {{headquarters}} of UK Athletics, and {{one of only two}} British venues to host fixtures in the elite international IAAF Diamond League. It is also the home of Birchfield Harriers, which has many international athletes among its members. The National Indoor Arena hosted the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships and 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships, as well as hosting the annual Aviva Indoor Grand Prix – the only British indoor athletics fixture to qualify as an IAAF Indoor Permit Meeting – and a wide variety of other sporting events.

5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Kentucky's citizens believed {{the state should}} be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} the other slave state governors, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the Mississippi River, and a Southern veto over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.|$|E

60|$|The {{brothers}} rode on {{the whole}} day, and towards evening <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a great forest, which they entered. Far within the wood <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a little house, and knocked at the door. There came an old, ugly, bearded hag, and opened it, and they asked her whether all of them could get quarters for the night.|$|R
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|While The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig {{appears to}} be the quintessential Ulster Cycle story in theme and narrative, there are certain unusual {{elements}} of the extant forms which suggest it may have a more satiric quality, parodying the heroic genre of the Ulster Cycle. The eponymous pig of Mac Da Thó may be mythic in origin, but its highly exaggerated size may also be satiric. In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the Ulaid and Connachta go to war over a mythic best, the finest bull in Ireland, whereas here <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> blows over a dog.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> help him finish it.|$|E
50|$|Later Björn and his {{brothers}} pillaged in England, Wales, France, and Italy, until <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the town Luna in Italy. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> back <b>to</b> Scandinavia, <b>they</b> divided the kingdom so that Björn Ironside took Uppsala and Sweden.|$|R
