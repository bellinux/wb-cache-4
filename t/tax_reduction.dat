The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting <b>tax</b> <b>reduction,</b> less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E

We find that permanent <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> reduce the emigration flows from Israel.

Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion <b>tax</b> <b>reduction,</b> a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution.

The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.|chapter=1975 'Capitalism is on the run'}} In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1-year <b>tax</b> <b>reduction</b> of $16billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation. Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a <b>tax</b> <b>reduction.</b> In Congress, the proposed amount of the <b>tax</b> <b>reduction</b> increased to $22.8billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts. In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these income tax rebates {{as part of the}} <b>Tax</b> <b>Reduction</b> Act of 1975. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7billion for 1976.|$|E

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of the first payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> {{implemented}} in France in the 90 s on the wage dynamics of low-income employees. Since these policies represent a net transfer from the State to the employer/employee match, they are unlikely to lead to wage reductions for employees of a given productivity level. However, the degressivity of such payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> leads to a concave link between wage and productivity such that for given productivity changes, wage increases are lower once the payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> are implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the validity of this low-wage trap hypothesis. Our first empirical strategy simply consists in comparing the evolution of wage increases for employees benefiting from the payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> with those of the closest individuals in terms of wages, but not affected by these reductions. This difference-in-difference strategy shows that low-wage employees were more likely than medium-wage employees to get a raise in 1997 than they were in 1994, when payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> were only marginal. The substantial minimum wage increase in the period makes it hard, though, to interpret these results causally. Our second empirical strategy compares the individual wage evolutions of a near-to-minimum wage employee between 1994 and 1998 with that of a similar individual but for the 1984 - 1988 period. We observe no significant differential evolutions. Overall, our results suggest that payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> did not decrease the expected income of low-wage employees, at least in the short or medium run.

In an empirical analysis for Switzerland, it confirms previously obtained theoretical results and determines the magnitude of the theoretical predicted effects. The results show that direct payments increase agricultural production between 3. 7 % to 4. 8 %. Alternatively to direct payments, the production effect of <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> is evaluated in order to determine its magnitude. The empirical analysis corroborates the theoretical results of the literature and demonstrates that <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> are also distorting, but to a substantially lesser degree if losses are not offset. However, <b>tax</b> <b>reductions,</b> independently whether losses are offset or not, lead to higher government spending than pure direct payment...|$|R

That Act authorized the restoration of the former 10 percent rate on these services beginning on April 1, 1966, for a two-year period (until April 1, 1968), at which time it was to be reduced to 1 percent, before repeal on January 1, 1969.|$|E

Using a distributional version of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition that takes into account the possible presence of a selectivity bias, it is found that the wage gap is mainly determined by the different characteristics between the workers that benefit from payroll <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> and those that do not. In addition, it is shown that neglecting the effects of sample selection leads to the overestimation of the share of the wage gap attributed to the different returns for these characteristics...|$|R
