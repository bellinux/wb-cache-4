It's because Mitt Romney, who is telling people he's an opponent of same-sex marriage, forced the justices of the peace and others to perform same-sex marriage, all on his own, with no authorization or requirement from the court. <b>Tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> twisted our politicians have become." ...|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman {{wanted to get away}} from the rendering of the characters in the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells you how to feel, <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E
500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{was one of}} {{the music}} videos shot during the two-week filming for B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{conceptualized}} by Beyoncé and co-directed by Anthony Mandler. The version of the song used in the clip is the extended mix, which is featured on the deluxe edition of B'Day. The video was shot over two days and choreographed by Rhapsody, Todd Sams, Clifford McGhee and Bethany Strong. For the shoot, Beyoncé asked former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, and sister Solange to appear with her in the video. She said that it [...] "sets the tone of the video". Beyoncé's mother and stylist, Tina created over 60 outfits for Beyoncé and the 50 extras featured in the video. The instructional dance-oriented video was inspired by the 1960s choreographies. Beyoncé cited influences from the Broadway director-choreographer Bob Fosse, Southern and Jamaican movement and the Frug from the musical Sweet Charity; Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine further noted that the video was inspired by the scene [...] "Rich Man's Frug" [...] from the movie. She said: [...] "It <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to do all the dances — it's modern, it's retro, it's vintage, it's stylized, it's all of those things put together." [...] The story moves from a tony party reminiscent of the jet set style of the sixties, followed with dance sequences. The video was released to US iTunes Store as a Video Triple on September 4, 2007. A re-edit of the video was produced for the Timbaland remix featuring Voltio. Although Voltio does not actually appear in the video, unused footages of the original video were replaced during the parts he sings. The re-edited video was posted on the MTV Overdrive on July 26, 2007. It was included on the DVD for Irreemplazable (2007).|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn {{was solid}} on defense, and won five Gold Gloves in a six-year span. He stole 318 bases in his career, {{with a high}} of 56 and a {{four-year}} stretch when he averaged 40. Only four players in MLB history had 300 steals and a career batting average of at least [...]338; Gwynn {{was the only one}} of the four to have played since 1928. He was also just the 10th player to retire with over 3,000 hits and 300 steals. Gwynn in 1999 was the first National League player to reach 3,000 hits since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American Leaguers reached the mark after Brock and before Gwynn; all but one played at least 400 games as a designated hitter. An NL player could not be a DH until 1997, when it was allowed for the few interleague games that were played in AL parks. Just six of Gwynn's first 3,000 hits came as a designated hitter. [...] "If you want to do it in the National League, you have to play a position", he said. [...] "It's been 20 years since anybody has been able to do it.

2500|$|Residents {{agreed to}} a strict code of conduct. They {{surrendered}} all personal possessions to the group, which provided food, clothing, and shelter. The rules also forbade consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Although the colony raised chickens in the beginning, eating any meat except fish was later prohibited. Ogden even said they must stop planting gardens, {{but they were still}} permitted to hire out as laborers to local farmers. Ogden received instructions for the settlement through her typewriter as well as in revelatory trips to the top of nearby Shay Mountain. She taught from the Aquarian Gospel and other theosophical works. Her doctrines included reincarnation, communication with the dead, and asceticism. It is said that she claimed to be the reincarnated Virgin Mary, identifying other group members as reincarnations of Brigham Young and the prophet Nathan. However, this was only reported by newspapers and never verified by credible sources from within the commune. Ogden also handled the colony's financial matters. In 1934, she purchased the local newspaper, the San Juan Record, made herself editor, and added a column in which she promoted her metaphysical ideas. In her first column of “Metaphysical Truths”, printed May 24, 1934, she describes metaphysics as [...] "that division of philosophy which relates to the science of being and to the hidden, or unseen things, which pertain to our spiritual rather than our material, or physical being which we KNOW because we are more conscious of the physical senses we have allowed to predominate. It also embraces that which <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> the Universe came to being, what composes the Universe, and how life started to manifest on it. As one writer states: 'It's the science of exploring the Universe outside of the Finite.'" [...] Additionally, a column called the “Dry Valley News” gave a summary of the goings-on at Home of Truth. She used the press to print pamphlets about her beliefs to distribute out as well.|$|E

How, as M. Guizot well puts it, the central despotism of Rome stript the Curiales of all they earned, to pay its own functionaries and soldiers; and gave them the power of appointing magistrates, who were only after all the imperial agents of that despotism, for whose sake they robbed their fellow-citizens. How the plebs, comprising the small tradesmen and free artizans, were utterly unable to assert their own opinions or rights. How the slave population, though their condition was much improved, constituted a mere dead weight of helpless brutality.|$|E
