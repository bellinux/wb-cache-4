5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. <b>That</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E

25|$|During the Roman Republic, {{the term}} peregrinus simply denoted {{any person who}} did not hold Roman citizenship, full or partial, whether <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> under Roman rule or not. Technically, this {{remained}} the case during the Imperial era. But in practice the term became limited to subjects of the Empire, with inhabitants of regions outside the Empire's borders denoted barbari (barbarians).|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Adevărul {{journalist}} Christian Levant {{investigated the}} Dedena affair, concluding that Panaitescu Jr.'s arrest, {{like that of}} {{other members of his}} Marxist circle, was made possible by the actions of an informant. In Levant's view, <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> Eugen Florescu, who later made a career in the Communist Party and, after the Revolution, in the nationalist Greater Romania Party, having served in the Senate until 2004.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} {{significance is}} the plenary indulgence {{attached to the}} Apostolic Blessing that a priest is to impart when giving the sacraments to a person in danger of death, and which, if no priest is available, the Church grants to any rightly disposed Christian {{at the moment of}} death, on condition that <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> accustomed to say some prayers during life. In this case the Church itself makes up for the three conditions normally required for a plenary indulgence: sacramental confession, Eucharistic communion and prayer for the Pope's intentions.|$|E

25|$|Altruism {{research}} suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped. Recent research has considered the role of similarity, and more specifically, shared group membership, in encouraging bystander intervention. In one experiment (2005), researchers found that bystanders {{were more likely to}} help an injured person if <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> wearing a football jersey of a team the bystander liked as opposed to a team the bystander did not like. However, when their shared identity as football fans was made salient, supporters of both teams were likely to be helped, significantly more so than a person wearing a plain shirt.|$|E
25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole of}} the Soviet Union became {{dedicated}} to the war effort. The population of the Soviet Union was probably better prepared than any other nation involved in the fighting of World War II to endure the material hardships of the war. This is primarily because the Soviets were so used to shortages and coping with economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I brought similar restrictions on food. Still, conditions were severe. World War II was especially devastating to Soviet citizens because it was fought on their territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over one million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and the elderly. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar, and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Additional rations were often so expensive {{that they could not}} add substantially to a citizen’s food supply unless <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with local resources that they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold any surplus they had at a high price and a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two {{years after the end of}} the war wiped out their wealth.|$|E

5000|$|Tensions were {{mounting}} in Tallahassee as 1960 neared. Bus boycotts {{and lunch}} counter sit-ins {{were taking place}} in Tallahassee and across Florida. On March 20, 1960, {{against the advice of}} his friends, Collins gave an impassioned speech about his conviction that as governor he represented all the people of Florida, [...] "whether <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> black or white, whether <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> rich or poor, or whether <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> influential or not influential." [...] He was the first southern governor to speak so frankly in support of the moral necessity of the end of segregation. His speech generated hundreds of responses, mostly positive, from citizens across the state.|$|R
5000|$|Lateral {{movement}} of eyes - Looking {{away from the}} person to whom one is speaking could {{be a sign that}} something else has taken their interest. It may also mean <b>that</b> a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> easily distracted. Looking to the left can mean <b>that</b> a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> trying to remember sound, while the right can mean <b>that</b> the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> actually imagining the sound. Side to side movement, however, can indicate <b>that</b> a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> lying.|$|R
500|$|The {{decision}} was praised by civil libertarians. Former President of the Victorial Council of Civil Liberties, Robert Richter QC, {{said that the}} {{decision was}} important [...] "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case {{is said to be}} a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable." [...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that it was a little bit naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really know what they were thinking." ...|$|E

He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot. [...] Then, Muhammad set the stone in place, {{satisfying}} the honour of all of the clans. After his Conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad is said to have ridden round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, touching the Black Stone with his stick in a gesture of reverence.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} of Serat Rerenggan mentions {{the story of}} Demang Tegis, a Portuguese man said {{to be one of}} the architect of Taman Sari. According to the manuscript, a strange man suddenly appeared in Mancingan Village (a locality name on the south coast of Java near Parangtritis). With long nose, white complexion, and a foreign language, the villagers suspected that the person was some kind of spirit or forest fairy. They presented him to the current sultan, Hamengkubuwono II. Apparently the sultan found interest in the person and took the strange man as his servant. Some years had passed and the man had finally learned to talk in Javanese. According to him, he was a Portuguese (or in Javanese, Portegis) who was stranded from a shipwreck. He also claimed to have been a housebuilder, so the sultan ordered him to erect a fortress. Satisfied by the man’s work, the sultan gave him the title [...] "demang." [...] From then on <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> known as Demang Portegis or Demang Tegis.|$|E

500|$|The Great Purge was {{a series}} of campaigns of {{political}} repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated against members of the Communist Party, writers and intellectuals, peasants and ordinary citizens. In September 1937 Stalin dispatched Anastas Mikoyan, along with Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, with a list of 300 names to Yerevan to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Armenian communist leaders such as Vagharshak Ter-Vahanyan and Aghasi Khanjian fell victim to the purge, the former being a defendant at the first of the Moscow Show Trials. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. <b>That</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. According to one study, 4,530 people were executed by firing squad in the years 1937-38 alone, the majority of them having been accused of anti-Soviet or [...] "counter-revolutionary" [...] activities, for belonging to the nationalist Dashnak party, or Trotskyism.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{versions}} {{describe how}} Leduc got its name.

In another, more official, version, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Edgar Dewdney (1835–1916), [...] decided that Telford Place should be renamed at the time the railroad terminal was established in 1891, and picked the name of the missionary priest.|$|E

[...] White set a major league record in 1884 with 35 hit batsmen, a total that remains the ninth highest in major league history. [...] He led the league again in 1885 with 27 batsmen hit by pitch.
