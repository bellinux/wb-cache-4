6000|$|Two {{hours later}} by his watch, Thomas Gradman, {{stirring}} in his swivel chair, closed the last drawer of his bureau, and putting into his waistcoat pocket {{a bunch of}} keys so fat that {{they gave him a}} protuberance on the liver side, brushed his old top hat round with his sleeve, took his umbrella, and descended. Thick, short, and buttoned closely into his old frock coat, he walked toward Covent Garden market. He never missed that daily promenade to the Tube for Highgate, and seldom some critical transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit. Generations might be born, and hats might change, wars be fought, and Forsytes fade away, but Thomas Gradman, faithful and grey, would take his daily walk and buy his daily vegetable. Times were not what they were, and his son had lost a leg, and they never gave him those nice little plaited baskets to carry the stuff in now, and these Tubes were convenient things--still he mustn't complain; his health was good considering his time of life, and after fifty-four years in the Law he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of late, because it was mostly collector's commission on the rents, and with all this conversion of Forsyte property going on, it looked like drying up, and the price of living still so high; but it was no good worrying--"The good God made us all"--as he was in the habit of saying; still, house property in London--he didn't know what Mr. Roger or Mr. James would say if they could see it being sold like this--seemed to show a lack of faith; but Mr. Soames--he worried. Life and lives in being and twenty-one years after--beyond that you couldn't go; still, he kept his health wonderfully--and Miss Fleur was a pretty little thing--she was; she'd marry; but lots of people had no children nowadays--he had had his first child at twenty-two; and Mr. Jolyon, married while he was at Cambridge, had his child the same year--gracious Peter! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> '69, a long time before old Mr. Jolyon--fine judge of property--had taken his Will away from Mr. James--dear, yes! Those were the days when they were buyin' property right and left, and none of this khaki and fallin' over one another to get out of things; and cucumbers at twopence; and a melon--the old melons, that made your mouth water! Fifty years since he went into Mr. James' office, and Mr. James had said to him: [...] "Now, Gradman, you're only a shaver--you pay attention, and you'll make your five hundred a year before you've done." [...] And he had, and feared God, and served the Forsytes, and kept a vegetable diet at night. And, buying a copy of John Bull--not that he approved of it, an extravagant affair--he entered the Tube elevator with his mere brown-paper parcel, and was borne down into the bowels of the earth.|$|E

But as I continued working for Gamble & Huff, I did a few sessions with Earl. My big Earl project was the O'Jays' 'For The Love Of Money.' I was astounded by his power. It may not come through on the records, but he is an ass-kicker. Listen to a classic Earl Young track like Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes' 'If You Don't Know Me By Now.' There's no click track. Earl had the drummer's equivalent of perfect pitch. I only saw the term referred to once, and it's called 'infallible rhythm.' Nobody has absolutely perfect time, but you find people like Buddy Rich and Tony Williams who can play without the time drifting. I've also seen studio drumming great James Gadson demonstrate infallible rhythm. I've seen him overdub drums on a track without a click track, and it's just perfect.

50|$|From {{the year}} 1960 until the mid-2000s, Purdue University Airport {{received}} regularly scheduled commercial air service. The airport saw {{as many as}} 45,000 passengers, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 1979 when the airport was served by Air Wisconsin and Indiana Airways. Allegheny Airlines / Lake Central Airlines (both now part of US Airways) maintained flights to Chicago O'Hare and Pittsburgh with the latter service being operated with British Aircraft Corp. BAC One-Eleven (BAC 1-11) twinjet aircraft {{for a period of}} time. Air Wisconsin offered service to Chicago O'Hare and to Marion. Great Lakes airlines operated daily flights to Chicago O'hare on a Beechcraft 1900, under the name of United Express. American Airlines offered service to O'Hare International Airport via its American Eagle line until the mid 1990s, when flights were halted after several crashes of the ATR aircraft operated by American Eagle, including the Roselawn, Indiana crash in October, 1994 (which had been operating from Indianapolis to O'Hare). These flights operated from the 90's until February 2001. Northwest Airlines (via Mesaba Air) also offered service to Detroit on saab 340's until late 2002. Lastly, American Connection (via Corporate Airlines) offered daily service to St. Louis on a Bae Jestream 32. This was the airports last scheduled airline service, and operated from December 1, 2001 until February 15, 2004. As of 2016, all of these carriers have ceased operations into Purdue Airport and there is currently no commercial passenger service operated from the airport. The airport has supposedly gone into talks with airlines, but none have gone far enough as to start service. In 2009, the airport proposed two daily round trip flights to and from Chicago's O'hare. This service, which would have been operated by Expressjet, never passed the planning phase. In 2016, the Lafayette Journal and Courier reported on the possibility of United Airlines flying to LAF, as the airline had announced that it was expanding operations in the midwest. The article was soon followed by another article, where Adam Baxmeyer confirmed that United wasn't coming to the airport.|$|E

40|$|Preface Although he {{probably}} does not remember it, it was Roy Jackson of Monash University in Melbourne and from Bacup in Lancashire who {{asked me if}} I {{was aware of the}} number of chemists coming from our mutual county. He then proceeded to rattle off the names of some for me. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> late 1988 when I was on leave at Monash, using the late Roger Brown’s pyrolysis equipment as we had none in Wellington. That snippet of information lay dormant in the grey matter for some 25 years, emerging only after I had agreed to write a series on Unremembered Chemists (as Peter Hodder, the then editor of Chemistry in New Zealand insisted the series be titled - after all if I knew of them then they were not forgotten) and selected the first few subjects. I found that several Lancastrian chemists were appropriate, remembered Roy’s comment, and decided to see just how many I could find. This booklet is the culmination of these efforts. Through the good graces of Chris Moody at Nottingham University, many living chemists who have distinguished themselves, but whom I had failed to recognise because it is many years since I left the UK, are now included. It is more than likely that there are others who should be here but are omitted, and to them I apologise. Apart from Roy and Chris, I am indebted to many of those whose details are included within these pages. Their willingness to provide information not easily available otherwise has made the writing and compiling of this ‘Legacy‘ so much the easier, and hopefully more interesting and useful. The free provision of images from numerous organisations, institutions and individuals is gratefully acknowledged for it puts the faces to the names. The pages that follow give the names of the chemists in sequence from William Henry (b. 1774) to the present with a profile of each that provides some indication of the person and the work for which they are recognised. It is not surprising, therefore, that early scientists attract a more detailed account than those still practising the profession and adding to the kudos that they already have gained.

40|$|One of {{the most}} gratifying aspects of Spore {{is the way it}} creates a ripple effect, putting readers in touch with one another and acting as a catalyst. One clear example came when Samuel Harry Abiye, Principal Agricultural Officer at the River State Development Programme in Nigeria, wrote to us to tell us how he {{followed}} up an article in Spore 88 about the work of Dr Howard Bradbury of the Australian National University (ANU), who had developed a kit to determine potentially fatal levels of cyanide in cassava root and products. This equipment formed part of the material and method of my post-graduate thesis work on relating total cyanogens to cyanide diseases, wrote Mr Abiye. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> February 2002. Mr Abiye is still in touch with Dr Bradbury and has in fact now {{become a member of the}} Cassava Cyanide Diseases Network (CCDN), an organisation launched by Dr Bradbury in 2000 under the banner of Working together to eliminate cyanide poisoning, konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN). Cyanide poisoning is a serious cause of death and disability, especially in Africa where many cassava varieties are bitter and high in cyanide levels. Konzo, a permanent paralytic condition of the legs, mainly affects children and young women in central and eastern Africa, especially in periods of drought, when cyanide levels in cassava are higher than usual. In West Africa, TAN is more common. It is a sensory disease, leading to difficulties in walking, numbness, deafness and blindness. Dr Bradbury developed his simple kit to measure cyanide levels in cassava plants and products and has so far distributed 400 of them. I was able to use Spore very effectively to advertise the cyanide in cassava kits, he said when Spore caught up with him recently. Since then we have sent out about 400 kits, each with 100 analyses, to health workers and agriculturalists. There are many who have said that they read about them first in Spore, including Mr Abiye, who is still in touch with me. Dr Bradbury has also developed a simple wetting method which greatly reduces the cyanide content of cassava flour. The flour is mixed with water and spread in a thin layer on a tray in the shade for 5 h. The flour s cyanide content is reduced to between 1 / 6 and 1 / 3 of the original level. The damp flour is used for cooking within 24 h. Trials with users in Mozambique, where there is currently an outbreak of konzo due to drought, have proved successful. Further details of the wetting method can be found on the CCDN website, and the cyanide kits are still available, free of charge, for readers in developing countries, from the address below.

40|$|June 17, 1963 Dear Dick: In {{answer to}} your memo of June 17, 1963. The State Labor News of which Carl W. Reinig {{is one of the}} incorporators and also was {{designated}} as the Agent has no connection with 'Labor'. It is merely a privÿe profit-making organizÿtlon purportinÿ to be giving labor news. Carl Reinig once ran the Franklin County AFL-CIO New-s Tribune, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the 1940 's; since then, he has had no connection with labor unions, but is the Agent of the State Publishing Comparÿwhich publishes both the State Labor News (ÿ 1. 50 per year) and the Labor Forecast ÿdReÿiew ($ 30. 00 per year) e Reinig is also President and probably the principal owner. I sent Bill Groeber a copy of both of those publications. I hÿve enclosed with this letter a copy of the Articles of Incorporation which were filed ÿith the Secretary of State of Ohio. Ae I said inÿ letter to Bill Groeber, the State Publishing Company was originally incorporated ÿn July 30, 1942; were reinstated on November 23, 1948 and again reinstated on January 20, 1950. There is nothing in the Secretary of State's office to show that they had filed azÿthlng since 1950 which might mean that their franchises has been cancelled. I asked our ÿttorney if there was anyway that Reinig could be stopped from using the name "State Labor News", but he doesn't think we could. I'm sure that many people think that he is speaking for Labor and he takes some antiÿlabor views at timesÿ If interested in this approach you might talk to Francis. So far as the particular issue we are both interested inÿ I have been {{trying to figure out how}} to find eut where he got that information, but can't think of an angle; of course, he may have just dreamed it up.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Weather in Richmond {{is a short}} {{documentary}} about the Oilers, the football team at Richmond High School in downtown Richmond, California, as they struggle in 2012 with the legacy of winning no games, {{with the exception of}} a forfeit, in two years. The video documents the city of Richmond’s poverty and violence, but it also is an account of the city’s cultural diversity, of the city’s industrial history and of the hopes of some of the people who grow up there. The video documents the social struggles of the players: many of them come from single­family households, many of their parents have used drugs and spent time in jail; and many of these players struggle against being drawn into Richmond’s gang culture. The video also documents the football team’s coach, Tashaka Merriweather, a then­ 27 ­year old who returned to Richmond to take care of his sick father a few years before. Merriweather went to college in Arizona after graduating from Richmond High School himself, realizing the same dreams of many of his current players: to ultimately leave Richmond, attend a university and build a better life. When Merriweather returned to Richmond, he thought that coaching at the high school would offer him the opportunity to do some good. He would try to help the young people there achieve their dreams of attending college and maybe, even, playing in the NFL, but he found the job harder than he expected, hard but rewarding. The coach now realizes he may remain in Richmond longer than he intended, improving the football team and helping its players. Often, the players leave the team before the season ends, discouraged with their losses, and distracted by family struggles. Many come to school in the mornings without much food in their stomachs because of their poverty; many are involved in the city’s gang life, which results in school suspensions and a lack of dedication to the team. Often, players are forced to leave the team because of poor grades (though a year later, in 2013, the coach succeeded in preventing a single player from needing to drop the team because of grades). The players who stick with the team say their dedication to it, and to Coach Merriweather, has prevented them from ever joining a gang and that their focus on high school football will be a major factor in their graduating. The video documents the city of Richmond’s poverty and violence, but it also is an account of the city’s cultural diversity, of the city’s industrial history; and of the health risks young people take when they play football. It is an account of an area of the San Francisco Bay that is often forgotten by the news media as it covers the affluent tech­sector­dominated neighborhoods of San Francisco and its suburbs.

The football team is 0 ­and­ 3 In fact, they’re 0 and 25. The team hasn’t won a game in almost two years. Shots of the game: Tonight they’re playing the California High School for the Deaf. And before long it’s clear this game won’t be any different for the Oilers. They’ll lose 47 to 0. Their best linebacker, Jorge Diaz, was benched after a concussion. And another star player, runningback Nate House, had to sit out because of an asthma attack. Nate House: Ya’ll don’t come to practice, then don’t nobody know what they’re doing. We can’t have people asking oh what do I do in the middle of the game? We look stupid doing that shit. So everybody — everybody got to come to practice on Monday.

Those guys who keep having mental breakdowns, alright, you got to figure it out, because you’re letting your teammates down. Simple as that. MW (INTERVIEW) : I don’t know if you’ve noticed, kind of driving into Richmond from other places and how the weather seems like it changes almost and there’s kind of cloudy and gloomy at times. That’s how I feel. That there’s a cloud or there’s a weight that’s on the people of Richmond, here, that’s weighing us down, and in turn that causes us to go against each other or kill each other or hate and say, ‘You can’t do that. ’ I hate to say it but almost like crabs in a bucket, and we’re all trying to climb out. Jorge Diaz is the team’s star linebacker [...] . The coaches want to get Jorge out of Richmond. [...] They’ve found him offers, and got him scholarships. But he’s staying put [...] to help his mom, who’s just been released from prison. He says he’ll go to nearby community college, improve his game there, and then transfer to a four­year university, someplace else [...] . someplace where the NFL sends recruiters. The NFL’s been a dream of mine since I was eight, and I’ve had people tell me that I wouldn’t be able to do it, I’m nothing, // the main thing is my pastor. Sadly I had a conversation with him about me pursuing football. He told me that I have more of a chance of getting struck by lightning than making it to the NFL, and that got me pretty pissed. So I stopped going to church. // I mean, the people that don’t believe in me, I really don’t associate with them because why associate myself with people that just bring my hopes down. A few blocks from the high school, the members of a local church make the team dinner every week. PASTOR CURTIS ZACKERY: “And the thing I love about what’s happening right now is that you guys are still here. I just want to acknowledge that. You guys are still here, and you’re standing up. So you’re basically walking forward, and you’re being men of character. In the middle of suffering, you’re saying basically, ‘Hey, I’m going to stand firm, and I’m allowing this character to produce hope that tomorrow night the win’s going to come. Does anybody still have hope that the win’s going to come? (No!) Alright, that’s what I’m talking about. ” KEY: Game 9 : Richmond vs. Albany, October 19, 2012 KEY: Richmond is 0 and 7.

Pastor Dave Curtis: “As a football player, you should know that it’s wartime. You should know that tomorrow is going to be a battle. You have a wartime mentality because you know that you’re about to face an enemy, you’re about to face an adversary. Cut to interview with Jorge. Jorge: “My mom told me to always hide my anger. She said never show it. So most of the time, I hide it. But when I get on that field it’s like — it’s like a no­holds­barred match — it’s just let it all out. While Jorge finishes, music starts; cut to the pre­homecoming­game dance. Shouting and dancing, the team runs off the field into the dark, feet pounding. Jorge: Ever since freshman year, I’ve had so much anger, I mean, there’s times where people step out of line, and I just want to beat them down. But I just remember what my mom always says, like, ‘Don’t show your anger. ’ So when I’m on that field I tend to try to tear heads off. So I just let all my anger out there. Jorege [...] with his mom at a halfway house now, Jorge lives with his cousin Matt [...] and Matt’s grandparents. Both of them have had parents in jail. In Matt’s Room Matt: It’s a big rivalry game, against Kennedy. we’re in the same city. And we gonna see what team’s better. Which is us.

Tra’von walks with Matt and Jorge to school almost every day. Cut to Tra’von and Matt talking about the game together. Matt: Towards the end of the season, you find out who your real players are, who really wants to stick around and play. And then once all the other people that didn’t feel like football was for them — they just quit — and then the people who wanted to play get in the game more. And then that’s how we got our first win. Tray: Lying flat on bed, looking at ceiling: Richmond High winning doesn’t sound normal. People were so surprised we won last week. Jorge: We ran 200 on Hercules, 400 on Albany. Tray: We only ran 200 on Albany? Jorge: Two, 200 plus. But then, just imagine how much we about to run today. Tray: Dang, 600.

But for now, get undressed and let’s see if we can follow those directions. MW: It’s going to be either midweek or sometime after Friday or whenever.

Lockerroom: MW: So it looks like they gonna cancel the dance. So they about to kick them out, but what you all got to do, or you’re going to be stuck in here: if you got rides, start calling them right now. They probably not going to let you walk by yourselves, so start calling your rides and chill out in here. PLAYER: I’m mad, the game is cancelled, we would have won probably, who knows. Now our dance is cancelled — all of this. Man, it’s some bullshit. It’s some BS. PLAYER: We could have came back easily. We could have came back easily PLAYER: We already know it was going to happen, we already know it was going to happen, we already know it was going to happen [...] . PLAYER: I’m mad ‘cause they cancelled the game! Interviews: MW: Things have changed just so fast. You know, when I played during that time, I had guys from North Richmond, from Central, from the South — all on the same team. But they wouldn’t want to kill each other. JORGE: “Yeah, at times I feel sorry for him because he could be somewhere else dealing with a team that’s five­and­oh or six­and­oh rather than Oh­and­ 2 or Oh­and­ 6, but he said it best is — the only time he’s going to leave — the only time he will leave is if they put a statue out in Richmond High of him. So I’m pretty sure he’s going to be around for a long time (smile). DEVONTE: I look up to him like a big brother. ‘Cause like he went to college and he also came from Richmond. He came out of Richmond High. So he told us his story of how he made it out of Richmond High. And I felt like if he did it, I’m pretty sure the rest of the team can do it, too. Shots of the last game.

Don’t be the weak sister tonight, gentlemen. Shot of an Oiler scoring a touchdown. In the first half, each of the teams scores a touchdown. But the Oilers have been arguing among themselves, and the coach isn’t happy. Locker room at halftime: MW: We been bickering and complaining about each other all damn year, alright? All year! Only reason we lose is because we can’t get past each other. Either we don’t like each other or we don’t like the players. Whatever it is, we can’t get past each other. And it’s a shame on senior night that we want to bring the same thing that’s been hindering us all year to the field on the last game. You want to argue, we never gonna get anywhere. We gonna have six points, alright. Yall need to figure out if we gonna play with a team, as a team, in the second half or if we gonna come in here with sad faces talking about shoulda, coulda, woulda like the whole season. Figure it out. COACH 2 : Let’s go, seniors. Huddle on sideline with Coach Byrd: PLAYER 2 : Coach, my momma is here! My mom is here! She never seen me run the ball! COACH BYRD: Yeah, she did! Matt couldn’t play this last game because of a leg injury. Matt: (talking on sideline, looking at game) : We’re actually a good team. I just don’t know why we can’t win. I mean most of our games have been close, but — we’re a good team. People just don’t see that. I don’t know why. But tonight, with parents here and a tied score, the mood in the stands is better than usual. Cheerleaders DEVONTE’S SISTER: I’m Jasmine Perkins, I’m Devonte Anderson’s sister. Devonte will be the actually first person out of the family to go to college. So this is a very big, special opportunity for him and us to see someone in the family make it, to fulfill their dreams, you know, make their wishes come true. We’re going to root for him, we’re trying to get there, we need one more! Let’s make a touchdown Vonte! Let’s go! Pan from Jasmine to Tra’von scoring a touchdown. CAMERAMAN: Tra’von, what just happened? TRA’VON: I just scored a touchdown. It felt pretty good. I mean, I’ve scored a touchdown before, but it never felt this good. It never felt this good. Especially to get it for my seniors, you know, we worked so hard for this. It never felt so good. It never felt so good. I just can’t wait to finish these last three minutes and 28 seconds— with effort. Let’s get this win. Little boy on sidelines to camera: We are getting our comeback! We are getting our comeback.
