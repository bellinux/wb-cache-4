5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E

25|$|When Hastings tells Poirot {{that he saw}} Norton {{return to}} his room the night before, Poirot says it is flimsy evidence, not having seen the face: the dressing-gown, the hair, <b>the</b> <b>limp,</b> can all be imitated. Yet, there is no man in the house who could {{impersonate}} Norton, who was not tall. Poirot dies {{of a heart attack}} within hours. He leaves Hastings three clues: a copy of Othello, a copy of John Ferguson (a 1915 play by St. John Greer Ervine), and a note to speak to his longtime valet, Georges. After Poirot is buried at Styles, Hastings learns that Judith has all along been in love with Dr Franklin. She will marry him, and leave to do research in Africa. When Hastings speaks to Georges, he learns that Poirot wore a wig, and that Poirot's reasons for employing Curtiss were vague.|$|E

500|$|Gonzalez {{retired from}} the army due to a {{disability}} in December 2012. He wore a back brace and complained of pain in his foot, though friends stated he never disclosed {{the nature of his}} injury. A family member said he had been injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Iraq and had been prescribed both antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication, though he was suspected to have since ceased taking the medication. Gonzalez' former step-son said that Gonzalez was [...] "a very good guy" [...] who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A family member said Gonzalez was on patrol in Iraq when his Humvee was struck, adding that [...] "a portion of his foot was amputated [...] and the evidence is <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> you see in the video of him running across the White House lawn." [...] According to a neighbour he used a cane and was taking [...] "very strong medication".|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called Holy Wood their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. LA Weekly said that [...] "almost all [...] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." [...] Hot Press praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that [...] "Holy Wood is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." [...] Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they [...] "play tighter than [...] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort)... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than <b>the</b> <b>Limp</b> Bizkits of the world." [...] The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of Rolling Stone commended him for [...] "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." [...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like Plastic Ono Band, Holy Wood screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments." ...|$|E

500|$|Depp {{signed on}} to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that {{he would come back}} if the script was good. Almost a year later, Disney {{announced}} that Depp would be paid $55.5 million for his role, realizing that without him the franchise would be [...] "dead and buried." [...] Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa, and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence. Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him [...] "angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes. While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk. Three other actors from the previous films returned, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Greg Ellis as Lt. Theodore Groves, and Damian O'Hare as Lt. Gilette. Keith Richards also had a cameo, reprising his role as Captain Teague from At World's End; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder. Previous cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley stated that they would not reprise their roles, as they wanted to be involved in different films. They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could. On August 1, 2009, Bill Nighy expressed his desire to return as Davy Jones, who died in the [...] saying the possibility to resurrect the character, but at the end, his inclusion was scrapped. On February 5, 2010, Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti, stating, [...] "They haven't asked me. But actually I don't mind that at all. I'm a fan of the first one especially and I think the trilogy we've made is great. I'd almost like them to leave it there." ...|$|E
500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote [...] "this {{convoluted}} {{hybrid of}} fairy tale and fantasy/action/comedy/horror aims for campy fun, but comes off tedious and blood-spattered." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety called the film [...] "inconsistently acted, and somehow both underwritten and overplotted," [...] {{and while the}} action is [...] "frequent and competently staged," [...] it might feel too repetitive [...] "as yet another witch is ripped apart limb from limb, sending yet another wave of viscera sluicing toward the camera." [...] Similarly, Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "after a while it’s easy to become numb to the repulsive sights and bored by action that once seemed intense and exciting" [...] in this [...] "rarely funny spoof that’s heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing," [...] giving it one-and-half star out of four. Steven Farber of The Hollywood Reporter also wrote a scathing review, saying that while [...] "Wirkola makes {{the most of the}} 3D technology", [...] "the film is too fanciful to be truly revolting" [...] for its gore effects and [...] "despite its few wry jokes, the script is awfully thin." [...] Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, writing that Wirkola [...] "focuses on the fights and flings all manner of viscera at the 3-D camera as limbs are whacked off and heads and torsos explode. Less attention was paid to the story, and the dialogue is a tad over-reliant on the random f-word to land a laugh." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film zero out of four stars, writing that [...] "nothing makes a whole lot of sense in this incoherent movie, whose director’s philosophy seems to be: When in doubt, cut somebody’s head off." [...] Kat Murphy of MSN gave it one star out of four, comparing this [...] "big-budget faux fairy tale about skanky witches" [...] to a [...] "downscale video game for dull-eyed teens happy to lap up lame wisecracks and lots of gore." [...] According to Vulture's Bilge Ebiri, [...] "if the similarly situated Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter took itself too seriously, the problem with Hansel & Gretel is that it doesn’t quite take itself seriously enough." [...] Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, calling it [...] "an intermittently fun, but overexcited and predictable mish-mash." [...] Alicia Malone of IGN rated it a 4.5/10, stating [...] "there are a few funny moments, but overall Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is too similar to many films we’ve seen before." [...] Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine lambasted the film's [...] "sub-Tim Burton aesthetic" [...] and wrote that [...] "the result suggests A Knight's Tale as penned by Seth MacFarlane," [...] giving it zero out of four stars. Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! praised some elements of the film, such as [...] "lush and colourful art design that recalls a Guillermo Del Toro production, sound creature makeup and special effects, decently choreographed action scenes and a pair of leads who do their damnedest to sell <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> script", giving it a score of 4/10. Chris Knight of The Vancouver Sun called it a [...] "mess of a fairy tale", expecting [...] "a wiccan outcry at the film’s depiction — nay, endorsement — of the torture of witch-folk." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave it one star out of four, concerned how it [...] "has an alarming number of females being strung up, burned, shot, decapitated and eviscerated." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussing}} the killing off of characters in her books, Rowling {{said that she}} always knew she was [...] "working towards the point where Hagrid carried Harry out alive [...] but supposedly dead [...] out of the forest". She said she had planned from very early on that Harry would walk to his death accompanied by the 'ghosts', and that [...] "he would emerge in Hagrid's arms". In her own words, [...] "that's what always kept Hagrid safe". She said [...] "Hagrid {{would have been a}} natural to kill in some ways", but that the mental image of this moment [...] a big fatherly Hagrid carrying <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> Harry in his arms [...] was so strong it decided his fate. She also liked the circular notion of Hagrid both bringing Harry into the world, and then bringing him back from the dead.|$|E

2500|$|Chester's {{character}} had no surname until Baer ad libbed [...] "Proudfoot" [...] {{during an}} early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by [...] "Townsman". Again, Conrad's {{sense of what}} the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as [...] "W" [...] in the June 15, 1958 episode [...] "Old Flame", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode [...] "Marshal Proudfoot", it is revealed that his middle name, as are his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's [...] "assistant", but in the December 13, 1952, episode [...] "Post Martin", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode [...] "Hank Prine" [...] (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his [...] "deputy" [...] stating [...] "Chester is not my deputy", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies ("Never Pester Chester"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch - McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> then, so probably got injured in the Civil War. Not long ago but long enough that he would have learned to live with <b>the</b> <b>limp</b> and virtually forget it.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike his {{previous}} postings at Aldershot and Osnabrück, while stationed in Aden, Nilsen {{had his own}} room. This afforded him the privacy to masturbate without discovery. His developed fantasies of sex with an unresistant or deceased partner unfulfilled, Nilsen compensated by imagining sexual encounters with an unconscious body as he masturbated {{as he looked at}} his own prone, nude body in a mirror. On one occasion, Nilsen discovered that, by using a free-standing mirror, he could create an effect whereby if positioning the mirror so his head was out of view, he could visualise himself engaged in a sexual act with another man. To Nilsen, this ruse created the ideal circumstance in which he could visually [...] "split" [...] his personality: in these masturbatory fantasies, Nilsen alternately envisaged himself as being both the domineering and the passive partner. These fantasies gradually evolved to incorporate his own near-death experience with the Arab taxi driver, the dead bodies he had seen in Aden, and imagery within a 19th-century oil painting entitled The Raft of the Medusa, which depicted an old man holding <b>the</b> <b>limp,</b> nude body of a deceased youth as he sat aside the dismembered body of another young male. In his most vividly recalled fantasy, a slender, attractive young blonde soldier who had been recently killed in battle would be dominated by a faceless [...] "dirty, grey-haired old man" [...] who would wash the body before engaging in intercourse with the spreadeagled corpse.|$|E
