5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called <b>the</b> <b>purse,</b> connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1mm wide and about 2.5mm long.|$|E
5|$|The defense, {{to support}} their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse.

5|$|The 2011 purse {{was set at}} $150,000, {{but fewer}} than 15 mushers {{finished}} the race that year, meaning the money allotted for the final two prizes were distributed {{to each of the}} 13 mushers who finished. <b>The</b> <b>purse</b> peaked at $200,000 in 2007, and winner Lance Mackey took home $40,000.

Rather than distribute the extra money to the finishers, the race chose to roll over the unused prize money into the 2015 race.

5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open <b>the</b> <b>purse,</b> and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>purse.</b> The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E

5|$|The peridioles {{are about}} 1 to 1.5mm wide and rarely up to 2mm wide. They are disc-shaped, but may appear angular due to {{pressure}} from neighbouring peridioles. Peridioles may be dark, or a drab gray if still covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.Peridioles in C.striatus are sheathed and attached to the endoperidium by complex cords of mycelia known as a funiculus in the singular. The funiculus is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called <b>the</b> <b>purse,</b> connected to the lower surface of the peridiole.

The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, however Cotto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique.

5|$|The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or barrel-shaped, 6–15mm tall, 4–8mm wide at the mouth, {{sometimes}} short-stalked, {{golden brown}} to blackish brown in age. The outside {{wall of the}} peridium, the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a tomentum) may be completely worn off. The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called <b>the</b> <b>purse,</b> connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes C.stercoreus is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus Nidula.|$|E
5|$|A {{struggle}} over the power of <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government {{rather than by the}} province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E

5|$|Not Guilty is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Harry Martin who bids goodbye to his blind mother before he leaves the house and soon encounters a fleeing thief. The thief deposits a stolen purse into Harry's pocket and the police promptly discover and arrest Harry. They take {{him back to his}} home where he bids goodbye and is jailed. His blind mother becomes ill, under the false belief that her son is away on a journey. After he learns of this, he breaks out and returns home. The police surround and search the house and Harry flees to another building on a clothesline. Successfully having eluded the police, Harry buys a paper the following morning and discovers that the real thief has turned himself in. The film is known for its early use of a close-up shot to portray the complex action of the thief depositing <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> into Harry's pocket. The film was released on September 20, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film survives in the Library of Congress archives.|$|E

5|$|The prerogatives and {{authority}} {{granted to the}} legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in {{the functioning of the}} government—it was not just a rubber stamp.

The legislature also held the power of <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E
