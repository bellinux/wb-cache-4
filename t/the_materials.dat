5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> being joined. One of the most popular, {{ultrasonic}} welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
