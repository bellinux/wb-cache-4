25|$|Richmond emerged {{a decade}} after the {{smoldering}} rubble of the Civil War to resume its position as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered <b>trolley</b> <b>system</b> in the United States, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the <b>trolley</b> <b>system</b> opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, with electric motors on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell's {{maternal}} great-grandfather Philip Fitzgerald {{emigrated from}} Ireland, and eventually {{settled on a}} slaveholding plantation near Jonesboro, Georgia, where he had one son and seven daughters with his wife, Elenor. Mitchell's grandparents, married in 1863, were Annie Fitzgerald and John Stephens, who had also emigrated from Ireland and was a Captain in the Confederate States Army. John Stephens was a prosperous real estate developer after the Civil War {{and one of the}} founders of the Gate City Street Railroad (1881), a mule-drawn Atlanta <b>trolley</b> <b>system.</b> John and Annie Stephens had twelve children together; the seventh child was May Belle Stephens, who married Eugene Mitchell.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the next decade, another longstanding building from the early years of Ossining, the Union Hotel at South Highland and Church Street, was demolished. A Romanesque Revival doctor's office building replaced it. In 1892 the corner section of the Barlow Block was separated internally {{from the rest of the}} building so it could serve as Ossining's post office, the first of two former locations for that facility within the district. The next year the village's electric <b>trolley</b> <b>system</b> was established, with its main line going down Croton Avenue from the then-undeveloped Ossining Heights area in the northeast corner of the village to Main Street, where a spur ran down to Sparta, and then continuing to the train station. Residents could more easily travel downtown, and Ossining Heights soon became the suburban residential area it is today.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{he developed}} was the Miami Beach Railway, an electric street railway system which served the additional purpose of providing electric service. He and other investors formed the Miami Beach Electric Company and the Miami Beach Railway Co. It began service on December 14, 1920 and ran from downtown Miami, where it shared tracks with Miami's own <b>trolley</b> <b>system,</b> to the County Causeway (renamed MacArthur Causeway after World War II). After crossing Biscayne Bay to Miami Beach, the tracks looped around {{the section of}} Miami Beach south of 47th Street. Around 1926, Florida Power and Light acquired Fisher's streetcar system, and expanded it, double tracking the line across the causeway. However, while sale of electric service was a growth industry across the United States, the street railway portion went into a period of decline, along with the entire industry. All rail service between Miami and Miami Beach was terminated on October 17, 1939.|$|E
25|$|The Williamsport Passenger Railway Company {{was founded}} by Peter Herdic. This {{precursor}} to the <b>trolley</b> <b>system,</b> later followed by the bus system, {{was a form of}} public transit. It was one of Herdic's few business ventures that was not profitable. He divested himself of the Williamsport Passenger Railway Company in 1879, a time in Herdic's life when he lost most of his wealth (only to reacquire most of it soon after). Peter Herdic used his position as an owner of the Susquehanna Boom to maintain high levies on the lumbermen who floated their logs down the West Branch Susquehanna River. These lumbermen teamed together to seek relief from the high levies from the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Peter Herdic used his wealth and political connections to buy the votes of many {{of the members of the}} assembly. He had to borrow heavily against his holding to provide the legislators with the money needed for their votes. This heavy borrowing combined with the Financial Panic of 1873 lead to Peter Herdic's eventual bankruptcy in 1878.|$|E

25|$|South Beach {{operates}} its own {{local bus}} system {{known as the}} South Beach Local. The fare is only 25 cents. Streetcar style trolley-replica buses have been implemented in over a dozen cities in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, such as downtown Miami, Coral Gables, and Hollywood. Since it began operation in 2003, the free Coral Gables Trolley (bus) has moved over four million commuters around downtown Coral Gables with over 5,000 riders per day, freeing up 750 local parking spaces and reducing car trips by 20% along its route. The city of Hollywood operates a trolley route serving its downtown area and Hollywood Beach. In April 2012, Miami initiated its own <b>trolley</b> <b>system</b> with loops around downtown similar to the Metromover {{as well as to}} the new Marlins Park and Civic Center. The Miami Trolley expanded to many routes over the next few years. Educational institutions such as University of Miami (Hurry 'Cane Shuttle) and Florida International University (CATS Shuttle) operate free shuttle-bus services on and around their campuses. In addition, FIU offers a Golden Panthers Express shuttle between their main campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus.|$|E
25|$|Ponce's public {{transportation}} system consists of taxicabs and share taxi service providing public cars and vans known as públicos and a bus-based mass transit system. There are five taxi {{companies in the}} city. Most públicos depart from the terminal hub located in downtown Ponce, the Terminal de Carros Públicos Carlos Garay. During the 1990s and 2000s, {{there was also a}} <b>trolley</b> <b>system</b> reminiscent of the one the city used in the 19th century and which traveled through the downtown streets, and which was used mostly by tourists. Today it is used mostly during special events. There is also a small train that can bring tourists from the historic downtown area to the Paseo Tablado La Guancha on the southern shore, As with the trolley, today the train is used mostly during special events. A ferry provides service to Isla de Caja de Muertos. The new intra-city mass transit system, SITRAS, was scheduled to start operating in November 2011, and, after a 3-month delay, the $4 million SITRAS system, was launched with 11 buses and three routes in February 2012. A fourth route was to be added for the El Tuque sector according to a 30 June 2012 news report.|$|E
500|$|Within the city, {{roads that}} run {{from north to}} south are {{traditionally}} called [...] "streets" [...] and roads that run from east to west are traditionally called [...] "avenues". Streets are numbered in blocks west of the Red River. Avenues are numbered in blocks north or south of DeMers Avenue – the city's historic dividing route adjacent to the rail yards. The city maintains a bus system called Cities Area Transit, also known by the acronym CAT. The system has operated since 1926 when it was introduced to replace an earlier <b>trolley</b> <b>system.</b> There are twelve bus routes including night service and service in the community of East Grand Forks.|$|E
50|$|Private {{automobiles}} {{became more}} affordable and {{more common in}} the years after that, and <b>trolley</b> <b>systems</b> began closing down in favor of buses during the 1930s.
