This study shows that accounting variables are powerful predictors of business failures {{one to two years}} prior to the bankruptcy.

25|$|The bank, {{which had}} {{established}} a number of foreign subsidiary companies {{in the years after}} 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>income</b> rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (single-sided) of the parent bank alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished {{in the second half of}} the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest-differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of the income statement. In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of client assets under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group’s foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non-CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee.|$|E

2500|$|A {{canonical}} visitation {{was made}} by Bishop Norbury around 1323: the precise date is unknown {{and there is a}} lacuna in the bishop’s register for this year. It found the financial situation and management unsatisfactory. [...] He forbade disbursements of pensions, liveries and corrodies - that is incomes paid in cash, clothing or food and lodging - unless his express permission was first sought. However, a visitation of 1521 found that the priory had no debts and its income stood at £20 13s. 4d. In 1535, a year before the Dissolution of the Monasteries began, the Valor Ecclesiasticus reported the priory drawing most of its income from its own house and demesne, with further income from lands and rents only in Horsebrook (in Brewood parish), Broom and Kidderminster. A number of landowners were recorded as contributing small alms for the upkeep of the nuns – the largest donor being Sir John Giffard of Chillington Hall, who gave 2s. 6d. Others were Sir Roger Corbet, said to be of Dawley, who gave two shillings; William Woodhouse of [...] Albrighton, who gave a shilling; a member of the Vernon family of Tong, presumably George Vernon (MP for Derby and Derbyshire), who could easily afford his two shilling donation; and one of the Blakemore family of Bradley, Staffordshire, who donated a shilling. Income from land and alms together added up to £11 1s. 6d., which must be incomplete. Other reports simply do not harmonise with this picture. Documents from only a few years later add income from Blithbury, Shredicote in Bradley, Stretton, Hampton Lovett and Hunnington in Halesowen. Apart from the demesne at Brewood, the most valuable incomes came from Broome and Blithbury, each bringing in around £3. [...] The <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>income</b> in 1537 was £17 2s. 11d. As the visitation of 1521 had found no debts, the priory must have become more financially stable in its last decades, although this was probably the result of improved financial management as much as increased revenue. The amounts involved are still paltry - far below the threshold of £200 net set for dissolution of the lesser monasteries under the Act of 1536 and it was listed as such in an official schedule. So the dissolution of the priory was a foregone conclusion, purely on financial grounds.|$|E

40|$|To achieve global competitiveness, firms need {{to create}} and develop {{strategies}} to deal with changing organizational operations and external environments.

This paper presents objective evidence on whether this criticism is indeed justified. First, we discuss the ongoing debate on ISO 9000 ability to significantly improve financial performance, the reasons for this debate, and the importance of resolving this debate one way or the other.
