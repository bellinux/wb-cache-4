5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and Too Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and <b>The</b> <b>Challenge</b> <b>in</b> 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|Sentries did detect boats {{moving along}} the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified. When the boats, loaded with the first wave lof British troops, were challenged, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> {{excellent}} French, allaying suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Jennings slowly {{began to}} chip away at Rutter's record, first by winning $714.29 in 2006 {{as part of the}} Mob on NBC's 1 vs. 100. A year later, Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the $100,000 top prize by {{defeating}} Ogi Ogas in the final round. Finally, on October 10, 2008, Jennings passed Rutter by winning $500,000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. He extended the record by winning $300,000 in The IBM Challenge, where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy! event. Rutter won $200,000 in <b>the</b> <b>challenge,</b> <b>in</b> which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity. He then added $100,000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game, raising his total to $3,555,102, second only to Jennings' $3,923,414.29.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, Clarke critiques the {{weaknesses}} of NTA {{in areas such as}} education, a balance between society wide norms and intracommunity values; policing, for criminal matters and public safety; and political representation, which limits the political choices of an individual if based solely on ethnicity. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> evaluating the efficacy of NTA lies in the relatively few legal implementations of NTA.|$|E
25|$|With its mix of {{right-of-way}} {{types and}} train control technologies, LRT offers {{the widest range}} of latitude of any rail system in the design, engineering, and operating practices. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> designing light rail systems is to realize the potential of LRT to provide fast, comfortable service while avoiding the tendency to overdesign that results in excessive capital costs {{beyond what is necessary}} to meet the public's needs.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} year of medical work at Hsiang-Ya, Greene noted <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> {{interacting}} with the local staff. He was also met with opposition from Changsha townspeople who thought the foreigner to be a bad omen, a possible cause of the flooding and the Cholera outbreak that were affecting their town. Due to a new policy of aiding only Chinese-administered programs, the Rockefeller Foundation withdrew funding from Greene's medical work, and the Hsiang-Ya hospital was closed for the summer of 1924.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is looking at}} ways to consider tumor marker proteomics {{in combination with other}} indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.|$|E

Copland runs what was essentially a complete copy of System 7.5 (in the Blue Box) in addition to an entirely separate operating system running under it. Copland therefore uses a Mach-inspired memory management system and relies extensively upon shared libraries, with the goal being for Copland to be only some 50% larger than 7.5.|$|E

25|$|All three PZL.19 {{took part}} in <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> <b>in</b> August 1932. In a {{technical}} evaluation they were bested only by RWD-6, but technical trials and the race part were less successful. Jerzy Bajan finished on the 11th place, Ignacy Giedgowd on the 18th and Bolesław Orliński withdrew from the race due to illness. Despite its failure in the Challenge (which was won by the Polish RWD-6), it {{was regarded as a}} successful machine and {{took part in}} several Polish and international contests.

In season 5, Darci and Aric were selected to sit out. They were then each allowed to save one other person (of the same gender). Darci chose Kelsey, Aric chose Alex.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} round things started to get interesting. Amelita, David and Hayley took up <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> the Australian-themed episode. Amelita's {{signature}} dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat with your eyes and that is beating me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David cooked up a delightful black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E

25|$|Artificial {{harmonics}} {{are more}} difficult to produce than natural harmonics, as they involve both stopping the string and playing a harmonic on the stopped note. Using the octave frame (the normal distance between the first and fourth fingers in any given position) with the fourth finger just touching the string a fourth higher than the stopped note produces the fourth harmonic, two octaves above the stopped note. Finger placement and pressure, as well as bow speed, pressure, and sounding point are all essential in getting the desired harmonic to sound. And to add to <b>the</b> <b>challenge,</b> <b>in</b> passages with different notes played as false harmonics, the distance between stopping finger and harmonic finger must constantly change, since the spacing between notes changes {{along the length of the}} string.|$|E
500|$|Q*bert {{continues}} to be widely recognized as {{a significant part of}} video game history. Author Steven Kent and GameSpy's William Cassidy considered Q*bert one of the more memorable games of its time. Author David Ellis echoed similar statements, calling it a [...] "classic favorite". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish and Kim Wild of Retro Gamer magazine described the game as difficult yet addictive. Author John Sellers also called Q*bert addictive, and praised the sound effects and three-dimensional appearance of the graphics. Cassidy called the game unique and challenging; he attributed <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> part to the control scheme. IGN's Jeremy Dunham felt the controls were poorly designed, describing them as [...] "unresponsive" [...] and [...] "a struggle". He nonetheless commented that the game was addictive despite the controls.|$|E
500|$|Plensa {{feels that}} <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>in</b> the {{creation}} of successful work of public art is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art.

[...] Although the city planned for some interactivity, {{the transformation of the}} fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised Plensa. [...] Now, when the National Weather Service issues summer heat advisories and the Governor of Illinois declares state office buildings as official daytime cooling centers, the national press points to Crown Fountain as a respite for inhabitants of the Chicago metropolitan area.|$|E
