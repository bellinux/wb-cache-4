5|$|Andy {{rushes to}} the {{potential}} client, a company called Prestige Direct, and impresses the CEO (Dan Castellaneta) with his dedication—in addition to his personal phone number, he also gives him {{a copy of his}} house key. Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> he calls Robert and offers him <b>the</b> <b>client</b> if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy. This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured. This piques David's interest, who allows Andy to come into his home and talk to him about his business proposal.|$|E

They dispose of the body, then meet <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find <b>the</b> <b>client</b> is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards <b>the</b> <b>client</b> but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> which manages the other software components in the background. Through <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in Discourse Studies [© Sage publications]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] analysts have noted that, in psychotherapy, formulations of <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> talk can be a vehicle for offering a psychological interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> circumstances. But we notice that not all formulations in psychotherapy offer interpretations. We offer an analysis of formulations (both of the gist of <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> words and of their implications) that are diagnostic: that is, used by the professional to sharpen, clarify or refine <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> account and make it better able to provide what the professional needs to know about <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> history and symptoms. In doing so, these formulations also {{have the effect of}} shepherding <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> account towards subsequent therapeutic interpretation. In a coda, we notice that sometimes the formulations are designed discreetly. We examine one such discreet formulation in detail, and show how its very ambiguity can lead to its failure as a diagnostic probe...|$|R

40|$|Service-level {{agreements}} (SLAs) {{establish a}} contract between service providers and clients concerning Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Without proper penalties, service providers have strong incentives {{to deviate from}} the advertised QoS, causing losses to <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> Reliable QoS monitoring (and proper penalties computed {{on the basis of}} delivered QoS) are therefore essential for the trustworthiness of a service-oriented environment. In this paper, we present a novel QoS monitoring mechanism based on quality ratings from <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> A reputation mechanism collects the ratings and computes the actual quality delivered to <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> <b>The</b> mechanism provides incentives for <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> to report honestly, and pays special attention to minimizing cost and overhead. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify <b>the</b> <b>client</b> of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E
