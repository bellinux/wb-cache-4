40|$|Behavioral {{variables}} {{are often used}} as performance indicators (PIs) of visual or internal distraction induced by secondary tasks. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate whether visual distraction can be predicted by driving performance PIs in a naturalistic setting. Visual distraction is here defined by a gaze based real-time distraction detection algorithm called AttenD. Seven drivers used an instrumented vehicle for one month each in a small scale field operational test. For each of the visual distraction events detected by AttenD, seven PIs such as steering wheel reversal rate and <b>throttle</b> <b>hold</b> were calculated. Corresponding data were also calculated for time periods during which the drivers were classified as attentive. For each PI, means between distracted and attentive states were calculated using t-tests for different time-window sizes (2 – 40 s), and the window width with the smallest resulting p-value was selected as optimal. Based on the optimized PIs, logistic regression was used to predict whether the drivers were attentive or distracted. The logistic regression resulted in predictions which were 76 % correct (sensitivity = 77 % and specificity = 76 %). The conclusion is that there is a relationship between behavioral variables and visual distraction, but the relationship is not strong enough to accurately predict visual driver distraction. Instead, behavioral PIs are probably best suited as complementary to eye tracking based algorithms in order to make them more accurate and robust...|$|E
40|$|SAfety VEhicles using {{adaptive}} Interface Technology (SAVE-IT Project) To {{determine how}} distracted and normal driving differ, this report re-examines driving performance {{data from the}} advanced collision avoidance system (ACAS) field operational test (FOT), a naturalistic driving study (96 drivers, 136, 792 miles). In terms of overall driving performance statistics, distraction (defined as 4 successive video frames where the driver’s head was not oriented to the forward scene) had almost no effect, except for decreasing mean throttle opening by 36 % and mean speed by 6 %. No consistent normal/distracted {{differences were found in}} the parameters that fit the distributions of steering wheel angle, heading, and speed (all double exponential) and throttle opening (gamma) for each road type by driver age combination. In contrast, logistic regression identified other statistics and factors that discriminated between normal and distracted driving. They included (a) turn signal use and age group for expressways, (b) gender and if the lead vehicle range exceeded 60 m for major roads, and (c) lane width, lane offset, and lead vehicle velocity for minor roads. Finally, in a supplemental analysis, <b>throttle</b> <b>holds</b> (1 - 4 s periods of essentially no throttle change suggesting the driver may not be attending to driving) were actually more common for normal driving when a single time window (1 s) by threshold change combination (4 %) was selected. However, when settings (time windows of 1 – 4 s, thresholds of 1 – 4 %) were tailored for each age group by road class combination, <b>throttle</b> <b>holds</b> could identify when the driver was distracted...|$|R

Mobility was just mobility, it saved lives or took them all the time. Michael Herr, Dispatches Blades thumping rhythmically, the Bell UH- 1 “Huey ” Iroquois helicopter, oneof the many war craft {{carrying}} America into 1960 s Vietnam, flies across the abyss between the late mechanization of World War II and the current virtuality of cyberwar in transparent battlespace. The gas-turbine-powered Huey turboshaft rotor marks an event in early-postmodern war, as America once again finds itself both through and in high technology. The rotor that turned lazily during the early days of battle in Vietnam is now running at full <b>throttle,</b> <b>holding</b> aloft the Boeing Sikorsky RAH- 66 Comanche stealth helicopter as it flies backward, banks verti-cally, and slips sideways, sliding fluidly through the battlefield of C 4 I 2 (command, control, communication, computing, intelligence, and interoperability). The spin-ning machine typifies what Chris Gray (1997 : 50) calls postmodern war, a con-stellation of “computation and information, the increases in speed, the prolifera-tion of contradictory trends, strange marriages and alliances, machine mediations of culture. ” In this essay, I approach the helicopter as a sign of postmodern war from a phe-nomenological perspective. Initially, the helicopter seems to be yet another piec...|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} the river and the bridge he was nearing {{suggested}} a plan, and the ominous grating of the overheated motor warned him that whatever he was to do he must do at once. As he neared the bridge he reduced the speed of the car to fifteen miles an hour, and set the hand <b>throttle</b> to <b>hold</b> it there. Still gripping the steering wheel with one hand, he climbed over the left-hand door to the running board. As the front wheels of the car ran up onto the bridge Barney gave the steering wheel a sudden turn to the right, and jumped.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal for}} this flight {{was to run}} an updated {{attitude}} tracker to fix the deficiencies noticed in Flight 25. We mapped pilot sticks to provide a pitch and roll angle command (+/- 20 degrees from a 7 degree trim point in pitch and +/- 35 degrees in roll). The pilot also had an auto <b>throttle</b> available to <b>hold</b> the aircraft at 23 m/s, which he engaged part way through the test run. The tracking looked very good and the pilot landed in the pitch / roll angle command mode...|$|R

His attempt to live outside of art in France was the {{catalyst}} for his discovery of the joy of painting through the simplicity of his subject and the emphasis on the transparency of his palette. Add he was looking for study material in the Amsterdam Zoo (Artis), the sparrow forced itself upon him, as a free and everyday subject. The little bird ended up {{in the center of a}} square canvas, with the painter's experiment (or experience) happening in the large background of the painting. The sparrow continues unmoved by the surrounding landscape, becoming mythic in its serenity and through the use of reproduction.|$|R
40|$|A {{flight test}} {{maneuver}} autopilot (FTMAP) {{is currently being}} flown to increase {{the quality and quantity}} of the data obtained in the flight testing of the highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) remotely piloted research vehicle (RPRV). The FTMAP resides in a ground-based digital computer and was designed to perform certain prescribed maneuvers precisely, while maintaining critical flight parameters within close tolerances. The FTMAP operates as a non-flight-critical outer loop controller and augments the vehicle primary flight control system. The inputs to the FTMAP consist of telemetry-downlinked aircraft sensor data. During FTMAP operation, the FTMAP computer replaces normal pilot inputs to the aircraft stick and throttle positions. The FTMAP maneuvers include straight-and-level flight, level accelerations and decelerations, pushover pullups, and windup turns. The pushover pullups can be executed <b>holding</b> <b>throttle</b> or Mach number fixed. The windup turns can be commanded by either normal acceleration or angle of attack. The operational procedures, control mode configuration, and initial simulation results are discussed...|$|R
