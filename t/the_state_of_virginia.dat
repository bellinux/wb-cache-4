5|$|Clark's militia {{was under}} the {{authority}} of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia,</b> and although a continental flag was flown over Fort Sackville, the area was governed as Virginia territory until the state gave it to the United States federal government in 1784. Clark was awarded large tracts of land in southern Indiana for his service in the war and modern Clark County is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years after}} Clark's death <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> granted his estate $30,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) as a partial payment on the debts it owed him.

5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} formed {{north of}} Hispaniola on August 25. It moved westward, passing over the Inagua Islands before striking {{the north coast}} of Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane on August27. The cyclone weakened to Category 1 strength as it crossed the island, close to Matanzas, but regained first Category 2 and then Category 3 strength as it moved north through the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on August31 as a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, it then quickly weakened to a tropical storm while moving northward through Georgia and South Carolina. The storm entered the Atlantic from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> on next day and dissipated on September3.|$|E

5|$|Coming {{into the}} Gator Bowl, the Virginia Tech defense was ranked first in total defense, second in pass defense, fourth in rushing defense, {{and third in}} scoring defense, {{allowing}} an average of just over 12points per game. The Virginia Tech defense was led by defensive end Darryl Tapp, a first-team All-ACC pick, an American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American, {{a finalist for the}} Lott Trophy, and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award. Tapp was considered a natural leader {{both on and off the}} field and led the Hokies' defensive workouts during practice. Tapp finished the regular season with 45tackles (including 12.5 for a loss) and ten sacks. He was also named a second-team Associated Press All-American, and he won the Dudley Award, given annually to the best college football player in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fellow linebacker Ken Brown {{was named}} a first-team All-Big East selection, {{signifying}} his status {{as one of the}} best players at his position in the conference. He finished the season with 93 tackles, including six for loss and two sacks, enough for No. 3 on the team in tackles. Despite that success, Brown suffered a pulled hamstring before Virginia Tech's final regular-season game and his presence in the Gator Bowl was doubtful. Virginia Tech sophomore defensive end Cornell Brown was named the best defensive college player in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> by the Roanoke Times after earning 20 tackles for loss, including 11 sacks, and 35 quarterback hurries during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, where 15 jurisdictions {{declared}} local emergencies, {{local governments}} took action to inform and protect citizens. Residents in mobile home parks, {{as well as}} campgrounds, were advised to evacuate, and 13 jurisdictions opened shelters by August 26. State Governor Jim Gilmore declared a State of Emergency, and as a result, the State Emergency Operations Center was activated. Beaches and piers were shut down in Virginia Beach, Hampton, and Gloucester counties, where communities canceled some local events due {{to the threat of}} Bonnie. Voluntary evacuations throughout the state were issued, and some hotels reached maximum capacity as a result. Roughly 60 Navy ships were ordered to leave port at Norfolk, and ride out the storm far out to sea. <b>The</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> banned swimming along the coast. As Bonnie progressed northward, a tornado watch was posted for much of eastern Virginia.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, {{following}} {{a request from}} Virginia governor Tim Kaine, President George W. Bush declared 19 counties in Virginia as disaster areas, along with the cities of Richmond and Poquoson. The declaration allocated federal funding to assist in paying for debris removal and the rebuilding of public infrastructure damaged by Ernesto's flooding, including roads, parks, and government buildings. The city of Newport News and four additional counties were added later in the areas eligible for federal funding. In all, FEMA provided about $7.3million (2006USD) in assistance. Although <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> applied for individual assistance, the federal government denied the request.|$|E

5|$|The {{corporate}} {{ownership of}} the Baltimore Steam Packet Company changed again in 1922, when the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) formed the Seaboard–Bay Line Company, which owned all of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company, making the steamship company a wholly owned subsidiary of the SAL on February 6, 1922. In addition to the infusion of capital from the SAL, the Old Bay Line also obtained a $4.4million Federal loan to build two new steamers for the Old Bay Line: the State of Maryland and <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia.</b> The Old Bay Line's president, S.

25|$|But on August 8, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> {{abandoned}} its plans {{and agreed to}} begin work on the northern route for Lee Boulevard. For nearly a year, state and county officials had disagreed whether the northern route rights-of-way were adequate to begin construction. The state disagreed, but Arlington County officials {{did not wish to}} spend more money {{in the depths of the}} Great Depression to acquire more rights-of-way. By actively reconsidering the southern route, however, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> put pressure on Arlington County to fix the rights-of-way problems with the northern route. Agreement to begin construction on the northern route finally was reached on August 8. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> agreed to provide $83,450 to purchase the remaining required rights-of-way.
