5|$|The {{transmission}} {{had three}} speeds with no neutral position; a mechanism held the clutch open when the motorcycle was at idle in first gear. First gear was positioned {{in the middle}} of the shift pattern, with second gear below and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> above.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E
5|$|Once {{in front}} of Schumacher, Hill was able to {{gradually}} extend his lead to 3.4seconds by lap30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear {{during the course of}} that lap, and then spun off at turntwo on lap31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car's damaged nosecone. Schumacher thus assumed the lead as a result of Hill's retirement, leading by 11.5seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top sixpositions. Schumacher made his secondpit stop on lap37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over thirdposition until lap39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighthposition. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his secondstop on lap43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving {{in front of}} Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap47, the gap between him and Schumacher not big enough to allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead {{to such an extent that}} when he made his own final stop on lap52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team's first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken battery cable on lap41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue's car caught fire on lap48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a spin on the circuit.|$|E
50|$|At Le Mans in 1955 the Cunningham C6-R, {{fitted with}} an Offenhauser engine, {{retired from the}} race.

25|$|Through all the retirements and bungled pit-stops, Red Bull driver David Coulthard {{raced to}} what became a strong fifth {{position}} despite losing <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> in the team's new quick shift gearbox. Despite Williams driver Rosberg's best attempts, {{he was unable}} to pass the Scot. This was Red Bull's strongest result so far this season and highlighted the improving performance of the Adrian Newey designed RB3 chassis.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the vehicle}} has {{completed}} {{the shift to}} second gear, the first gear is immediately de-selected, and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending.

25|$|Each company built two {{prototype}} helicopters for {{a flight}} test program. Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype featured a three-wheel landing gear in a tricycle arrangement, and placed the pilot in the cockpit front {{instead of the usual}} rear seat, to help with nap of earth flying. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype featured a three-wheel landing gear with the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> at its tail. Its cockpit placed the pilot in the rear seat.|$|E
50|$|Later {{cars had}} {{shallower}} doors. In 1950, the Vanguard and the Triumph Renown {{were the first}} cars to be fitted with a Laycock de Normanville clutchless overdrive controlled from the gearlever. The Phase 2 car was available with the Laycock overdrive that operated on the second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> of the three-speed transmission, creating, in effect, a five-speed gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|The Jeep Truck was {{available}} {{with only one}} transmission, the Borg-Warner T-90 three-speed manual, with synchromeshed second and <b>third</b> <b>gears.</b> A Spicer/Dana 18 transfer case was used on four-wheel drive models.

50|$|Other key {{improvements}} over the TR3 included a wider track front and rear, slightly larger standard engine displacement, full synchromesh on all forward gears, and {{rack and pinion}} steering. In addition, the optional Laycock de Normanville electrically operated overdrive could now be selected for second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> as well as fourth, effectively providing the TR4 with a seven-speed manual close ratio gearbox.|$|R
500|$|In {{his first}} career start, Scott ran for 157yards, but Friedgen {{thought he could}} have done better. Friedgen said, [...] "He was a little tired from camp... Normally, he would break some of those runs. I don't think he quite had his <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> today." [...] Steffy played a solid first half, but in the second, threw two interceptions before {{suffering}} a season-ending thumb fracture. He was replaced by back-up Chris Turner who started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Regarding their loss, Delaware head coach K.C. Keeler said, [...] "This is not like a moral victory. I don't believe in moral victories... This was not a payday for us... We play a home game, we make more money than playing this game down here.

500|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops began on lap 199; Johnson stopped on lap 203, while Earnhardt made a pit stop on the {{following}} lap. After the pit stops, Kahne retook the lead. Johnson drove to the track's inside at turn three and passed Kahne for the lead on lap 211 and started {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field. Bowyer drove to his garage on lap 216 for a transmission change because he lost the use of <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> Jeff Gordon had closed the gap to Kahne by lap 229. Green-flag pit stops started six laps later when Kahne made a pit stop from second place. Johnson took on four tires at his stop on lap 239, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon, who ceded it to Earnhardt two laps later. Martin's pit crew dropped a lug nut which resulted him remaining stationary for 21.7 seconds. Burton stalled his car which required his crew to push him to the end of pit road. An eighth caution was triggered on lap 242 when Yeley attempted to drive down pit road, and Martin was approaching him. Martin tried to avoid Yeley by steering left onto the turn four apron but made contact with him. Martin then spun and went hard into the tri-oval wall; his car got airborne in the process. Robby Gordon could not avoid the melee and hit Yeley. Gordon consequently spun into the front stretch grass but continued.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his later}} years, Kibbey decided the {{automobile}} was firmly established {{and that he}} should learn to drive. [...] After taking lessons, he found that he tended to lose control of the vehicle when operating it at the higher speed afforded by <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> [...] Consequently he restricted himself to driving in either first or second gear {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Kibbey died in Phoenix on June 14, 1924. [...] He was buried at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery.|$|E

5000|$|The only {{available}} transmission was the six-speed manual Tremec T56. The transmission used the skip-shift feature to conserve fuel during light loads by preventing drivers {{from using the}} second and <b>third</b> <b>gears,</b> and a dual mass flywheel to reduce [...] "rattle" [...] in no load conditions.

2500|$|A {{more famous}} name, Ettore Bugatti, {{designed}} the new [...] four-cylinder Bébé of 1912. The same year, Peugeot returned to racing {{with a team}} of three driver-engineers (a breed typical of the pioneer period, exemplified by Enzo Ferrari among others): Jules Goux (graduate of Arts et Metiers, Paris), Paolo Zuccarelli (formerly of Hispano-Suiza), and Georges Boillot (collectively called Les Charlatans), with 26-year-old Swiss engineer Ernest Henry to make their ideas reality. The company decided voiturette (light car) racing was not enough, and chose to try grandes épreuves (grand touring). They did so with an engineering tour de force: a dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) 7.6-liter four-cylinder (110x200 mm) with four valves per cylinder. It proved faster than other cars of its time, and Boillot won the 1912 French Grand Prix at an average of , despite losing <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> and taking a 20-minute pit stop. In May 1913, Goux took one to Indianapolis, and won at an average of , recording straightaway speeds of [...] making Peugeot the first non-American-based auto company to win at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In 1914, Boillot's 3-liter L5 set a new Indy lap record of , and Duray placed second (beaten by ex-Peugeot ace René Thomas in a [...] Delage). Another (driven by Boillot's brother, André) placed in 1915; similar models won in 1916 (Dario Resta) and 1919 (Howdy Wilcox).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 yrs or [...] on U.S.A. models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. [...] Transmissions replaced from March 2005 and later include a redesigned <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> clutch pack reported to fix the problem.|$|E
50|$|The {{steering}} and suspension was a star feature, the steering action exceptionally steady and light. The car does not heel or roll {{and there is little}} wheel bounce. The best speeds on second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> were 48 and 68 mph, 90 mph should be possible in top. Providing on the road such rapid acceleration and high rates the engine ran fairly quietly and with smoothness yet displaying exuberant spirits.

50|$|Most UK cars in {{this class}} {{featured}} manual transmission and with the FE Vauxhall belatedly fell into line with their principal UK competitor by including a four-speed gearbox - available only at extra cost on the old Victor FD - as standard equipment. The FE's extra weight presumably made this development irresistible. The four-speed transmission used the same box and ratios across the range, from the 1759 cc Victor to the torquey 3294 cc Ventora-badged version: contemporary road tests of the four-cylinder cars comment adversely on the wide gap - highlighted on the mountain roads included in the Portuguese route chosen for the car's press launch - between second and <b>third</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Unfortunately for loyal Oldsmobile customers, GM {{management}} on Woodward Avenue in Detroit were {{focusing on}} cost savings per vehicle by this time, a philosophy later called [...] "less car for more money" [...] by the 1970s. [...] One drawback of this thinking {{was that the}} 1961 through 1964 Oldsmobiles lost their dependable (but expensive to build) Jetaway Hydramatic transmissions. [...] Replacing those time-tested four speed units was a much cheaper to build three speed unit, the Roto Hydramatic. [...] This transmission had no front fluid coupling at all, and utilized a single [...] "fill-and-dump" [...] coupling to perform double duty as both a fluid coupling in third speed while having a third reaction member, which Olds called an [...] "Accel-O-Rotor," [...] which was actually a small stator, thus giving some limited torque multiplication in first. [...] In theory, the [...] "Accel-O-Rotor" [...] would provide the same multiplication range in first as both {{the first and second}} gears of the four speed unit without all the hardware...and cost. [...] It was also unique at that time, in that second speed was pure mechanical connection from engine to rear end...no fluid coupling involved. [...] The big problem with this unit in the Oldsmobiles (and lower line Pontiacs of the same era) was engine speed would race wildly in first, and then hit a [...] "brick wall" [...] of a very steep RPM decline in second, which was equivalent to <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> in the four speed Jetaway Hydramatic. [...] This unit was very trouble prone and unreliable, and cost a great deal of performance otherwise obtainable from the Rocket. [...] It would linger for only these three years, when it was replaced by the much more reliable, but less efficient, Turbo Hydramatic in 1965. [...] Customer complaints caused many dealers and independent transmission shops to wholesale replace the Roto Hydramatic in these cars with older (or contemporary, from a Pontiac Star Chief or Bonneville) HM315 four speed Hydramatic.|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{used the}} term [...] "SelectShift" [...] because placing the gear {{selector}} in second gear forced the transmission to start and remain in second gear only, regardless of engine revolutions, or torque {{being sent to the}} unit.

50|$|It can be {{seen from}} this that unlike the {{transmission}} of a car, there was no overall torque-multiplication effect from selecting a lower gear. The 4:1 mechanical advantage afforded to the single engine driving in first gear was cancelled out by {{the fact that there was}} only one engine operating, so the maximum output torque from the transmission was the same as was available in top gear with all four engines operating. The same argument applies to second and <b>third</b> <b>gears.</b> The transmission of this locomotive, therefore, unlike almost all other locomotive transmissions, did not provide any means of matching the torque characteristics of the engine(s) to the requirements of the locomotive; it did not provide for an increased torque output at low speeds for starting and hill climbing.
