5000|$|RTM is {{a process}} using a rigid two-sided mould set that forms both {{surfaces}} of the panel. The mould is typically constructed from aluminum or steel, but composite molds are sometimes used. The two sides fit together to produce a mould cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior {{to the introduction of}} matrix material. Resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity. These variations include everything from the RTM methods used in out of autoclave composite manufacturing for high-tech aerospace components to vacuum infusion (for resin infusion see also boat building) to vacuum assisted resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> (VARTM). This process can be performed at either [...] or elevated temperature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the applicability of the acoustic emission (AE) and ultrasonic inspection (UT) technique for the monitoring of cure related defects in thick resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> (RTM) products. The AE technique was applied for defect monitoring during the cooling down phase to room temperature while the UT technique was used to assess the final material quality of the product. The results of the investigation suggest a relation between AE activity, UT gain level and the presence of cure related defects such as shrinkage cracks and porosity. A higher level of AE activity corresponds in general with a higher UT attenuation level and a lower quality of the RTM product. The results of the investigation were used to detail the influence of RTM material and process parameters such as resin type (tough, brittle) and heating rate during RTM processing. The results were further used to optimise the design of the RTM product mould. 1...|$|R

40|$|Tomographic imaging {{using both}} microfocus {{radiation}} and synchrotron radiation {{was performed to}} assess the void defects in resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> woven carbon fibre composites. The focus {{of this study is}} on characterising the void homology (e. g. local void size and spatial distribution) in relation to weave orientation, infusion direction and potential effects on damage formation in tensile loading. As the orientation angle between the fibre direction of unidirectional layer in the laminate and the direction of the global resin flow increases, from parallel to perpendicular, larger voids and a greater volume fraction of voids were observed, which led to increased damage formation upon loading. Significant accumulation of voids around both the layer interfaces and yarn fibres were also observed. With regard to yarn design, it is recommended to balance the benefits (e. g. fabric handling, structural integrity of preform) and drawbacks (e. g. lower fibre content, more voids) of the supporting yarn. Also, sensible placement of resin inlets and outlets could reduce the amount of deleterious voids, i. e. by promoting resin flow along the fibre direction in the most defect-sensitive off-axis layers...|$|R

The effect of using LPA on the thermo-mechanical properties of resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> UP/fibreglass composites is investigated. The flexural and shear properties are measured by three-point bending tests. The trend of these mechanical properties is identified for 0 % to 40 % LPA content.

The specimens fail by tension in the flexural test and show a mixed shear/tension failure mode in case of short beam tests. From scanning electron microscopy, morphological change of the fractured surface is observed with an LPA-rich phase. Glass transition temperature (Tg) measured by thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) show reproducible data and compare well with each other.

40|$|AbstractIn {{directly}} {{addressing the}} question, ‘can flax replace E-glass as a reinforcement for structural composites?’, this manuscript adopts a novel comparative case study approach {{to investigate the}} manufacture and mechanical testing of full-scale 3. 5 -m composite rotor blades (suitable for 11 kW turbines) built from flax/polyester and E-glass/polyester. The resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> flax blade is 10 % lighter (fibre mass saving of 45 %) than the identical construction E-glass blade. Static flap-bending tests, conducted in accordance to certification standards, confirm that like the E-glass blade, the flax blade satisfies the structural integrity requirements under ‘normal operation’ and ‘worst case’ loading. It is consequently claimed that flax is a potential structural replacement to E-glass for similar composite small wind turbine blade applications. The failure root bending moment and corresponding tip displacement of the flax blade are 11. 6 kNm and 2300 mm, respectively. The blades exhibit distinctly different load–deflection curves and failure modes. The mean flexural rigidity of the flax and E-glass blades {{are estimated to be}} 24. 6 kNm 2 and 43. 4 kNm 2, respectively. It is interesting to find that although flax fibres and their composites are generally recognized for their stiffness, a flax blade cannot compete against an E-glass blade in terms of stiffness...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{processes}} to perform microchip encapsulation for electronic packages. Existing analytical models, such as generalised Hele-Shaw model, seem to be inadequate to model the process accurately in real world environment due to the complex inter-relationships among the encapsulant properties, process conditions, mould design parameters and overall moulding performance and the inherent fuzziness of the moulding systems. It is quite often that the observed values from the <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> for microchip encapsulation may not be regular. Although statistical regression method could be used to perform the modelling, high degree of fuzziness inherent in <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> systems for microchip encapsulation makes the obtained models having wide possibility range. In this paper, the fuzzy regression concept and its application in modelling <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> for microchip encapsulation are described. Fuzzy regression is a well-known method to deal with the problems {{with a high degree of}} fuzziness. Thirty-two experiments were firstly conducted based on an 2 iv 8 - 2 experimental plan in this study that involved eight process parameters and three quality characteristics. The experimental settings and results of the 30 experiments were then used to develop three fuzzy linear regression models, which relate various process parameters and the three quality characteristics, respectively. With the use of these models, proper process conditions and prediction range of individual quality measures can be obtained. Two validation tests were carried out to evaluate the developed models. Results of the tests show that the actual values of all the quality measures were found within the corresponding prediction ranges.

The removal of loosely bound or weakly adsorbed contamination from surfaces can usually be achieved using conventional cleaning methods such as solvents or proprietory aqueous-based cleaning solutions. However, the removal of fully crosslinked material which might be strongly adsorbed or chemisorbed onto surfaces, such as paints or adhesives, presents a much greater challenge. Similarly, residual epoxide resins remaining on the inside surfaces of resin <b>transfer</b> <b>mould</b> (RTM) tooling post curing are strongly adhered to the mould surface and need to be removed so that the mould can be reused. The mould materials are typically steel or nickel but may be compositebased. Conventional methods cannot fully remove residual epoxide material without the use of hazardous chemicals and mechanical removal can easily result in damage to the underlying mould which may compromise its reuse. Therefore, a number of novel cleaning solutions have been investigated to address the challenging problem of how to remove fully crosslinked epoxide resins from RTM mould surfaces...|$|R
