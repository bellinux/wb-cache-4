25|$|A novel {{treatment}} {{approach has}} recently been developed {{as a result of}} <b>translational</b> <b>research.</b> It has been shown that a combination of acute dosing of d-cycloserine (DCS) with exposure therapy facilitates the effects of exposure therapy of social phobia.

However, it acts as an agonist at the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor site, which is important for learning and memory.|$|E
