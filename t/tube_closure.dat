2500|$|The caspase {{proteins}} {{are integral}} {{parts of the}} apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results. [...] A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation. [...] A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality. [...] However, {{with the use of}} cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural <b>tube</b> <b>closure.</b> [...] These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli. [...] Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation. [...] A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.|$|E

Many of the errors are related to laboratory diagnostics. Efforts to reduce laboratory errors over recent decades have primarily focused on the measurement process while pre- and post-analytical errors including errors in sampling, reporting and decision-making have received much less attention. Proper sampling and additives to the samples are essen-tial. Tubes and additives are identified not only in writing on the tubes {{but also by the}} colour of the <b>tube</b> <b>closures.</b> Unfortunately these colours have not been standardised, running the risk of error when tubes from one manufac-turer are replaced by the tubes from another manufacturer that use different colour coding. EFLM therefore sup-ports the worldwide harmonisation of the colour coding for blood collection <b>tube</b> <b>closures</b> and labels {{in order to reduce the}} risk of pre-analytical errors and improve the patient safety...|$|R

40|$|Caffeine {{consumption}} is worldwide. It {{has been part}} of our diet for many centuries; indwelled in our foods, drinks, and medicines. It is often perceived as a "legal drug", and though it is known to have detrimental effects on our health, more specifically, disrupt the normal fetal development following excessive maternal intake, much ambiguity still surrounds the precise mechanisms and consequences of caffeine-induced toxicity. Here, we employed early chick embryos as a developmental model to assess the effects of caffeine {{on the development of the}} fetal nervous system. We found that administration of caffeine led to defective neural <b>tube</b> <b>closures</b> and expression of several abnormal morphological phenotypes, which included thickening of the cephalic mesenchymal tissues and scattering of somites. Immunocytochemistry of caffeine-treated embryos using neural crest cell markers also demonstrated uncharacteristic features; HNK 1 labeled migratory crest cells exhibited an incontinuous dorsal-ventral migration trajectory, though Pax 7 positive cells of the caffeine-treated groups were comparatively similar to the control. Furthermore, the number of neurons expressing neurofilament and the degree of neuronal branching were both significantly reduced following caffeine administration. The extent of these effects was dose-dependent. In conclusion, caffeine exposure can result in malformations of the neural tube and induce other teratogenic effects on neurodevelopment, although the exact mechanism of these effects requires further investigation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND INFORMATION The {{primordial}} {{central nervous}} system begins as a plate of cells in embryonic life which folds on itself to form a <b>tube.</b> The <b>closure</b> of the <b>tube</b> occurs within 21 - 28 days post conception. Incomplete closure 1, 2, 3 results in neural tube defects (NTD) causing anencephaly, encephalocoele and spina bifida. Frequency of occurrence of NTD is influenced by geographic, socioeconomic and ethnicity status 1, 3 reflecting a combination of predisposition and environmental factors. In Australia incidence of NTD including terminations {{has been reported to}} be estimated at 16 per 10, 000 births. 2, 3 Evidence from randomised studies has shown that maternal use of folate supplements prior to and during early pregnancy can reduce the occurrence and reoccurrence of 2, 4, 5 NTD.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: World Class Manufacturing (WCM) {{was first}} {{introduced}} into Nampak in 1990, and since then, {{there have been three}} attempts by the organisation to re-implement WCM in the organisation. In the last 23 years, 1990 - 2013, no formal assessment has been done with regard to evaluating whether the introduction of WCM was effective or not in the organisation, according to the goals and objectives set when the projects were initially implemented. The aim of this research report was to evaluate whether the implementation of WCM was effective in the Nampak Plastic Rigids (PRs) clusters and the study focused on only three operations namely; Nampak <b>Tubes,</b> <b>Closures</b> and Megapak. Secondly, the research aimed to establish what elements were required to successfully implement and sustain WCM in an organisation. Through the research it was established that in order to implement and sustain WCM successfully the following elements are required; strategy alignment, strategy implementation or execution, benchmarking, employee involvement, change management and the correct selection of continuous improvement tools and tactics. The three operations selected in the study were then evaluated against these elements through a survey, in order to gauge their alignment against each element. The research found that none of the three operations met the ideal state of 85 per cent in aligning themselves to the six elements. Nampak Tubes was the only operation that came close to the required ideal level of 85 per cent, as the operation had re-implemented WCM in 2011 and as a result, the operations performance in terms of the selected KPIs was better than that of the other two. However, on average none of the three operations reached the 85 per cent ideal range. This was an indication that the PRs were not aligned to the required six elements in their attempt to implement WCM, and despite the three previous attempts, success had not been achieved. The elements could prove complex as regards their comprehension and implementation as guided by the literature review and research, thus leadership should take careful note of the relationship between all of them. The organisational leadership is responsible for ensuring that the WCM strategy is driven centrally and adopted by all the stakeholders in the organisation, as all the elements require a leadership intervention. World Class Manufacturing is more than a concept or a project; it is a philosophy which should be treated as a way of life, if organisations are to be successful in being competitive...|$|R

30|$|The {{tracheal}} <b>tube</b> prevents <b>closure</b> {{of vocal}} cords, and represents an access for bacteria to {{progress in the}} trachea through the folds of high-volume low-pressure tracheal tubes into the lower respiratory tract [7]. Underinflation of the tracheal cuff under 20 cmH 2 O results in microaspiration, and was identified as an independent risk factor for VAP [10]. However, this cut-off is based on one single center study including few patients. Therefore, microaspiration could probably occur at highest or lowest levels of cuff pressure. Mechanical ventilation {{plays an important role}} in microaspiration, and cuff pressure is tightly correlated with airway pressure [11]. The application of a positive end expiratory pressure was identified as protective from microaspiration and VAP [12, 13]. Tracheal suctioning could be associated with higher risk for microaspiration, because of negative pressure applied during this procedure. It has been demonstrated that leakage rate around the cuff depends on the difference in pressure between the two areas above and below the cuff [14]. A recent study was conducted in 25 intubated critically ill patients to determine the impact of tracheal suctioning on leakage of blue dye, diagnosed using fiberoptic bronchoscopy [15]. Whilst blue dye was observed in the folds within the cuff wall in a larger number of patients before compared with after suctioning, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P[*]=[*] 0.063).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{present the}} design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of fully soft pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) with low threshold pressures that {{are intended for}} direct cardiac compression (DCC). McKibben type PAMs typically have a threshold pressure of at least lOOkPa and require rigid end fittings which may damage soft tissue and cause local stress concentrations, and thus failure points in the actuator. The actuator design I present is a variant on the McKibben PAM with the following key differences: the nylon mesh {{is embedded in the}} elastomeric <b>tube,</b> and <b>closure</b> {{of the end of the}} tube is achieved without rigid ends. The actuators were tested to investigate the effects of mesh geometry and elastomer material on force output, contraction, and rise time. Lower initial braid angles and softer elastomer materials provided the best force, contraction, and rise times; Up to 50 N of force, 24 % contraction, and response times of 0. 05 s were achieved at 100 kPa. The actuators exhibited low threshold pressures (< 5 kPa) and high rupture pressures (138 kPa - 720 kPa) which suggest safe operation for the DCC application. These results demonstrate that the actuators can achieve forces, displacements, and rise times suitable to assist with cardiac function. by Steven Obiajulu. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|In the {{developing}} chordate (including vertebrates), the neural tube is the embryo's {{precursor to the}} central nervous system, which comprises the brain and spinal cord.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy {{and feeding}} jejunostomy {{are used for}} providing long-term nutritional support to patients with neurological disorders. Various mechanical complications of these procedures are described. Case presentation We report {{a case of a}} 17 -year-old boy with cerebral injury who had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube changed to a feeding jejunostomy tube. Twenty-four hours later he developed abdominal pain and became clinically septic. A contrast study through the feeding tube and a subsequent computed tomography scan did not reveal any intra-abdominal pathology. At laparotomy it was discovered that the tip of the feeding tube had perforated through the jejunal wall and was lying outside the lumen. This was successfully treated by re-inserting a feeding jejunostomy <b>tube</b> distally and <b>closure</b> of the perforation and previous FJ site Conclusion We suggest that the threshold for contrast studies and operative intervention should be low in neurologically impaired patients to avoid the delay in treatment of tube-related complications. </p...|$|R
40|$|Duodenal {{perforation}} following blunt abdominal {{trauma is}} an extremely rare and often overlooked injury leading to increased mortality and morbidity. We report two cases of isolated duodenal injury following blunt abdominal trauma and highlight the challenges associated with their management. In both these patients, the diagnosis of the duodenal injuries was delayed, leading to prolonged hospital stay. The first patient had two perforations, one on the anterior {{and the other on}} the posterior wall of the duodenum, of which the posterior perforation was missed at initial laparotomy. In the other patient, the duodenal injury was missed during the initial assessment in the emergency department. He returned to the emergency department 24 hours after discharge with abdominal pain and vomiting. During trauma related laparotomy, complete kocherization (mobilization) of the duodenum must be mandatory, even in the presence of obvious injury on its anterior wall. We emphasize on keeping the management protocol simple by a “triple tube decompression”, i. e. duodenorrhaphy (simple <b>closure),</b> <b>tube</b> gastrostomy, reverse tube duodenostomy and a feeding jejunostomy...|$|R
40|$|In vertebrates, early brain {{development}} {{takes place at}} the expanded anterior end of the neural <b>tube.</b> After <b>closure</b> of the anterior neuropore, the brain wall forms a physiologically sealed cavity that encloses embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (E-CSF), a complex and protein-rich fluid that is initially composed of trapped amniotic fluid. E-CSF has several crucial roles in brain anlagen development. Recently, we reported the presence of transient blood-CSF barrier located in the brain stem lateral to the ventral midline, at the mesencephalon and prosencephalon level, in chick and rat embryos by transporting proteins, water, ions and glucose in a selective manner via transcellular routes. To test the actual relevance of the control of E-CSF composition and homeostasis on early {{brain development}} by this embryonic blood-CSF barrier, we block the activity of this barrier by treating the embryos with 6 -aminonicotinamide gliotoxin (6 -AN). We demonstrate that 6 -AN treatment in chick embryos blocks protein transport across the embryonic blood-CSF barrier, and that the disruption of the barrier properties is due to the cease transcellular caveolae transport, as detected by CAV- 1 expression cease. We also show that the lack of protein transport across the embryonic blood-CSF barrier influences neuroepithelial cell survival, proliferation and neurogenesis, as monitored by neurepithelial progenitor cells survival, proliferation and neurogenesis. The blockage of embryonic blood-CSF transport also disrupts water influx to the E-CSF, as revealed by an abnormal increase in brain anlagen volume. These experiments contribute to delineate the actual extent of this blood-CSF embryonic barrier controlling E-CSF composition and homeostasis and the actual important of this control for early brain development, as well as to elucidate the mechanism by which proteins and water are transported thought transcellular routes across the neuroectoderm, reinforcing the crucial role of E-CSF for brain development...|$|R
