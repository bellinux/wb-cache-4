500|$|The album has {{attained}} widespread acclaim from {{media outlets}} since its release. Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone {{explained that it}} was a brave and absorbing attempt to locate a common ground in the early 1980s divergent and often hostile musical genres; he concluded, [...] "Remain in Light yields scary, funny music <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> can dance and think, think and dance, dance and think, ad infinitum." [...] Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the record as one [...] "in which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary Afrofunk synthesis—clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic". Michael Kulp of The Daily Collegian commented that the album deserves the tag [...] "classic" [...] like each of the band's three previous full-length releases, while John Rockwell, writing in The New York Times, suggested that it confirmed TalkingHeads' position as [...] "America's most venturesome rock band". Sandy Robertson of Sounds praised the record's innovative nature, while Billboard wrote, [...] "Just about every LP Talking Heads has released {{in the last four years}} has wound up on virtually every critics' best of list. Remain in Light should be no exception." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Didascalia of the Apostles is the {{earliest}} document that specifically discusses {{the role of}} the male and female deacons more at length. It originated in Aramaic speaking Syria during the 3rd century, but soon spread in Greek and Latin versions. In it the author urges the bishop: [...] "Appoint a woman for the ministry of women. For there are homes <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> cannot send a male deacon to their women, on account of the heathen, but you may send a deaconess... Also in many other matters the office of a woman deacon is required." [...] The bishop should look on the man who is a deacon as Christ and the woman who is a deacon as the Holy Spirit, denoting their prominent place in the church hierarchy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1778, Hicks {{helped to}} build the Friends meeting house in Jericho, which remains a place of Quaker worship. Hicks preached {{actively}} in Quaker meeting, and by 1778 he was acknowledged as a recorded minister. Hicks {{was regarded as a}} gifted speaker with a strong voice and dramatic flair. He drew large crowds when he was said to be attending meetings, sometimes in the thousands. In November 1829, the young Walt Whitman heard Hicks preach at Morrison's Hotel in Brooklyn, and later said, [...] "Always Elias Hicks gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked theology, all religion, all worship, all the truth <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> are possibly eligible—namely in yourself and your inherent relations. Others talk of Bibles, saints, churches, exhortations, vicarious atonements—the canons outside of yourself and apart from man—Elias Hicks points to the religion inside of man's very own nature. This he incessantly labors to kindle, nourish, educate, bring forward and strengthen." ...|$|E

I am aware of the various comments and allegations that have been made about JWR's Armley factory, particularly as the source of the contamination <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> refer. Those comments and allegations are not accepted." [...] In the Commons, John Battle responded that he was in possession of correspondence [...] "in which the same T plc sought to convince Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes that, for tax purposes, J.W.

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Germany in 1895 Goltz became a lieutenant-general and {{commander}} of the 5th Division, and in 1898, head of the Engineer and Pioneer Corps and Inspector-General of Fortifications. In 1900 he was made General of Infantry and in 1902 commander of the I. Army Corps. After returning to Germany in 1895, Goltz was {{in close contact with}} his students, and offered them his advice. In a 1899 letter to Colonel Pertev Beyone, one of his protégés, Goltz wrote: [...] "All the hopes of Turkey rest on her youth, the generation <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> belong, and which can save the country, once it reaches the top." [...] Goltz often expressed admiration for the ordinary Turkish soldier, whom he regarded as immensely tough, brave and willing to suffer without complaint. By contrast, Goltz had nothing but contempt for the young people in Germany, who he charged were being [...] "corrupted" [...] by hedonism, urbanization, industrialization, prosperity, liberalism and Social Democracy, something that he believed was rendering the next generation of Germans increasing unfit for the test of war. In articles he published in Germany on the Macedonian Question in the early 20th century, Goltz was very pro-Ottoman, saying that the Ottomans had every right to remain in Macedonia. In his letters to his Ottoman protégés, he often urged them to invade Bulgaria to punish the Bulgarian government for its support of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. An Anglophobe, Goltz believed that the great coming war of the new 20th century would be an inevitable Anglo-German war for world domination. Goltz took for granted that the world was too small for the British and German empires to share, and one or the other would have to go. Starting in 1899, Goltz wrote to his Ottoman protégés, asking them to start preparing plans for invading Egypt to take the Suez Canal and for invading Persia as the prelude for an invasion of India. Goltz also believed that the European era of dominance would come to a close in the 20th century, pointing to the rise of new powers like the United States, Japan and eventually China. Goltz was greatly impressed with Japan’s victory in the Russian-Japanese war, and saw it as confirming his theory that in war, it is ultimately the will to win that makes the difference with the side with the stronger will always prevailing. In contrast to the anti-Asian racist [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] propaganda being offered by his own government, Goltz had considerable respect for Asian peoples, and wrote in 1905 to Pertev: [...] "The East is beginning to awake; once it is awakened, it will not go to sleep again." [...] Stressing that these were his own views, not those of the German government, Goltz speculated that sometime in the future a war would begin between the [...] "yellow race" [...] of the Japanese, Chinese and Mongols against the [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] powers, the United States and Great Britain. Goltz argued that neither Germany nor the Ottoman Empire could remain indifferent to this war, and it was necessary that Germany learn to understand [...] "the rising peoples of East Asia." [...] Goltz concluded his letter to Pertev: [...] "Since we will engage much more in the East in the future, it would be sensible to learn the special power…given to them by nature." ...|$|E
