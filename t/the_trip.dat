5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> believing {{that it would be a}} test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b> He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met. Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.|$|E

50|$|Ramon Sender co-produced <b>the</b> <b>Trips</b> Festival with Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand.

Counterculture sound engineer Ken Babbs is mostly credited for the sound systems he created for <b>the</b> <b>Trips</b> Festival. Prior to Babbs’ creation, it was discovered that particular music usually sounded distorted when cranked to high levels because of the cement floor on the San Francisco Longshoreman’s Union Hall (where <b>the</b> <b>Trips</b> Festival was taking place). Babbs being a sound engineer resolved the problem. He made sound amplifiers that would not create distorted sounds when turned up to high sound levels.|$|R

It contends that, while none of these narratives is complete, each of them provides valuable insight into understanding the context in which the Agreement was created. The Article then explores why less developed countries have been dissatisfied with the international intellectual property system and discusses latest developments in the area, such as the recent WTO debacle in Cancun, the proliferation of bilateral and plurilateral free trade agreements, and the increasing use of technological protection measures. The Article concludes by offering suggestions on how less developed countries can take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>TRIPs</b> Agreement and reform the international intellectual property system...|$|R
