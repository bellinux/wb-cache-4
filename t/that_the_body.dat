5|$|As {{public concern}} over the {{accident}} grew while information and education was limited, misconceptions arose {{about the nature of}} radiation hazards.

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the B cell antigen-specific {{receptor}} is an {{antibody molecule}} on the B cell surface, and recognizes whole pathogens without {{any need for}} antigen processing.

5|$|Observations of Titan {{prior to}} the space age were limited. In 1907 Spanish {{astronomer}} Josep Comas i Solà observed limb darkening of Titan, the first evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> has an atmosphere. In 1944 Gerard P.

5|$|On 1 January 1776, the British started {{collecting}} {{bodies of}} the deceased and soon found {{the body of a}} high-ranking officer of the American colonial army.

5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
5|$|The star's {{magnitude}} as observed from Earth is 9; this signifies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is {{not visible}} {{with the naked}} eye, but can be seen with a telescope.

5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E

5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|Black also learns of {{the murder}} in Maryland, and connects it to the killings of four {{other women in the}} locale. Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Wiley's main thesis in Lights Out is {{that light}} is a {{physiological}} trigger that controls dopamine and hormones like cortisol. Wiley posits <b>that</b> with <b>the</b> {{extension of the}} natural day through artificial lighting, rest at the hormonal level is rarely adequate for optimum biological needs of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In her view, this results in both fatigue and unnatural appetite, which leads to weight gain, exhaustion and disease. Wiley theorizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> responses are cyclical, reflecting the seasons of <b>the</b> year, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> needs vary seasonally. According to Wiley, {{during the winter months}} <b>the</b> <b>body</b> needs more sleep, and carbohydrates should be restricted as they would have been naturally during hunter-gatherer times.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} possibility that the detected radial velocity was caused by the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting the possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, when World Rugby was {{considering}} {{a change in}} the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president Bernard Laporte announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> would require that all France national team members hold French passports. This requirement is in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years' residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement remain eligible for selection even if they do not hold French passports.|$|E

In an epiphany she imagines Jesus Christ as her seventh husband, full of love and never hurtful; she becomes a nun and finding the love she sought all her life. Arun and Nandini return home after he tells her that Susanna is dead.|$|E

5|$|Joan Reade, Pauline Reade's mother, was {{admitted}} to Springfield Mental Hospital in Manchester. She was present, under heavy sedation, at the funeral of her daughter on 7 August 1987. Five years after their son was murdered, Sheila and Patrick Kilbride divorced. Ann West, mother of Lesley Ann Downey, died in 1999 from cancer of the liver. Since her daughter's death, she had campaigned to ensure that Hindley remained in prison, and doctors said that the stress had contributed to the severity of her illness. Winnie Johnson, mother of Keith Bennett, continued to visit Saddleworth Moor, where it is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of her son is buried. She died in August 2012.|$|E

Khan was ahead 40-36 on all three judges score cards {{at the time of}} the knock out. Judah was adamant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> shot should have been called low and claimed that he had been expecting a mandatory five-minute recovery period.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution.
