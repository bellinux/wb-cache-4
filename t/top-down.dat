5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the <b>top-down</b> perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true <b>top-down</b> view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the <b>top-down</b> view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|Blaster Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation and location of the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a <b>top-down</b> perspective. Gameplay in the <b>top-down</b> perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E
5|$|Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon {{are played}} using the side-scrolling view {{introduced}} in , while Zelda's Adventure has a <b>top-down</b> view {{reminiscent of the}} original The Legend of Zelda. All the CD-i Zelda games begin with animated FMVs to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} CD-ROM format, save Zelda's Adventure, which begins with a live-action video.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay is {{identical}} to the previous instalment: races are viewed from a <b>top-down</b> perspective, and players race in environments such as bathrooms and pool tables (many tracks contain obstacles such as common household objects) in vehicles including powerboats and helicopters. The game adds sixteen vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 2013, Nintendo {{released}} The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, {{which takes}} place in the same world, but features a new storyline, new puzzles and original dungeons. Height and depth play a large role in the game by taking advantage of the 3DS’ 3D feature, while maintaining the traditional <b>top-down</b> perspective.|$|E
5|$|Star Ocean is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} that is played from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. The player navigates a character throughout the game world, exploring towns and dungeons and interacting with non-player characters. Unlike the original game, the PlayStation Portable remake includes a world map for the player to navigate.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{standard}} action-adventure game, played from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. The player takes {{on the role of}} Arthur King and is accompanied by two Knights of Justice controlled by the game console. The player battles enemies using a regular sword swing or a special attack, and can block high and low attacks.|$|E
5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on <b>top-down</b> nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E
5|$|Majin Tensei is {{a series}} of {{strategy}} video games published by Atlus. It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei franchise, and began with 1994's Majin Tensei. Since then, four further titles have been released: Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis (1995), Ronde (1997), Majin Tensei: Blind Thinker (2007) and Majin Tensei: Blind Thinker II (2008). The player navigates a field seen from a <b>top-down</b> or three-quarters perspective as a human character, and battles demons; they can also recruit demons, and fuse multiple allied demons to create new, stronger demons.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines is a <b>top-down</b> racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving toy {{vehicles}} such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on desks.|$|E
5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was entirely different from the <b>top-down</b> approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as {{it was difficult to}} extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman.|$|E
5|$|Players journey between field screen {{locations}} {{on the world}} map, a three dimensional, downsized representation of Final Fantasy IXs world presented from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain like bodies of water or mountain ranges. To overcome geographical limitations, players can ride chocobos, sail on a boat or pilot airships. Like previous Final Fantasy installments, travel across the world map screen and hostile field screen locations is interrupted by random enemy encounters.|$|E
5|$|Robotron is a 2D {{multi-directional}} shooter game {{in which}} the player controls the on-screen protagonist from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. The game {{is set in the}} year 2084 in a fictional world where robots ("Robotrons") have taken control of the world and eradicated most of the human race. The main protagonist is a nameless superhuman attempting to save the last human family.|$|E
5|$|Since the company's establishment, it {{has worked}} on {{multiple}} projects, including the Just Cause series of open world action-adventure games published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix, and Mad Max. They have also developed the free-to-play The Hunter, <b>top-down</b> shooter Renegade Ops and Rumble City, their first mobile game. The company aims to begin self-publishing new original intellectual properties in the future.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Legendia is a console {{role-playing}} game set in {{a fantasy}} world featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. The game is presented from a <b>top-down</b> perspective, and players must move their character {{through a number of}} locales, battle monsters, and interact with non-player characters to advance the story. Unlike previous games in the series where monsters were visible before being encountered, Tales of Legendia features randomized battles that occur every few steps while inside dungeons or other hostile areas.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{seen from}} a <b>top-down</b> perspective, and focuses on sword combat. The player moves the hero through the game world, which is divided into several areas; as the player enters one, enemy {{characters}} start to appear there. Among the areas in the game world, there are dungeons that the player needs to get through. These usually consist {{of a number of}} rooms divided across three to four floors; in order to navigate their way through a dungeon, the player needs to break walls, unlock doors, and sometimes press down buttons and break pots.|$|E
5|$|The player {{initially}} {{can see a}} <b>top-down</b> view of the surface-level of {{the fortress}} site; each layer of a z-axis level can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level {{would be seen as}} its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level would have only its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for digging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, staircases to be carved, and, at the final designated level, end the staircase by having it dug into a room.|$|E
5|$|The {{version for}} {{personal}} computers (PC) is an action role-playing game which plays from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. Controlling Nakajima, the player explores the labyrinthine levels of a dungeon populated by enemies. Combat {{plays out in}} real time, with Nakajima fighting demons using both short-range melee attacks and ranged magic attacks. Each section of the dungeon ends in a powerful boss character.|$|E
5|$|Undertale is a {{role-playing}} {{game that}} uses a <b>top-down</b> perspective. In the game, players control a child and complete objectives in order to progress through the story. Players explore an underground world filled with towns and caves, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their journey. The underground world {{is the home of}} monsters, many of whom challenge the player in combat; players decide whether to kill, flee, or befriend them.|$|E
5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 was {{featured}} in the U.S. version of Top Gear. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards professional stunt driver and show co-host Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood, car expert and co-host were featured in the unveiling of the game. Foust drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger. The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a <b>top-down</b> shot of the pad. On the pavement the word Forza was spelled out in tire marks. Additionally in the final episode of the show's second season Wood and co-host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway, otherwise known as Sears Point; Foust drove the Lexus LF-A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove the course in Forza Motorsport 4.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a <b>top-down</b> perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E
5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 {{was designed to be}} a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a <b>top-down</b> view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{role-playing}} {{games of the}} 16-bit era, Secret of Mana displays a <b>top-down</b> perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The game features three such characters: the hero, the girl, and the sprite, named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the initial North American and European releases. The player can choose to control each of the characters at any time; whichever character is currently selected, the other two companions are controlled via artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by up to three players, {{made possible by the}} Super Multitap accessory for the Super NES console. The Virtual Console version of the game supports three-player gameplay via additional GameCube controllers or Classic Controllers.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 2015, {{a mobile}} game titled Evolve: Hunter Quest {{appeared}} briefly on the iOS App Store {{and was later}} removed. The game was released by 2K on January 29, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS devices. The game is a free-to-play tile-matching video game, {{as well as a}} companion app to Evolve. In Evolve: Hunter Quest, players match three tokens of the same colour in order to unleash attacks on enemies, fill up energy bars to activate special Hunter abilities and earn mastery points to level up. Mastery points earned in-app can then be applied to characters in the main Evolve game on any platform. Players who download the app can also unlock unique game art and watch replays of online matches from a <b>top-down</b> view.|$|E
5|$|Once General Tire {{sold the}} network in 1957, Mutual's {{ownership}} was largely {{disconnected from the}} stations it served, leading to a more conventional, <b>top-down</b> model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual {{as a vehicle for}} foreign propaganda. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the <b>top-down</b> perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E
5|$|Players {{take control}} of Nier—a middle-aged man in Nier and Nier Gestalt and a teenaged boy in Nier Replicant—though the {{character}} can be renamed by the player. The player directly controls Nier through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The three-dimensional world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can move freely throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders. In some rooms and buildings, the camera swings {{to the side and}} Nier is restricted to moving as in a two-dimensional platforming environment, while during certain battles the camera pulls up to simulate a <b>top-down</b> shoot 'em up or other video game genres.|$|E
5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his <b>top-down</b> management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the <b>top-down</b> The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
5|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{has similar}} {{gameplay}} to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing {{games of the}} 16-bit era, the game displays a <b>top-down</b> perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, {{as opposed to the}} three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three of them will be playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.|$|E
5|$|Shoot 'em ups are a subgenre of shooter game, in turn a type {{of action}} game. These games are usually viewed from a <b>top-down</b> or side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance. The player's avatar is {{typically}} a vehicle under constant attack. Thus, the player's goal is to shoot {{as quickly as possible}} at anything that moves or threatens him. In some games, the player's character can withstand some damage; in others, a single hit will result in his destruction. The main skills required in shoot 'em ups are fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns. Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive. These games belong to one of the fastest-paced video game genres.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players {{take control of}} members of a military unit dubbed Pharzuph Division 7. The three-dimensional environments are explored from a <b>top-down</b> perspective, and the overhead camera can be zoomed in and out on the playable character. Seven characters {{are available at the}} start of the game, with an eighth being unlocked later on. The game uses two modes of play. In single-player, the player controls the party leader while the two assigned companions are controlled using the game's artificial intelligence. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features cooperative (co-op) multiplayer. Activated through wireless connection, up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons.|$|E
5|$|Sorath {{submitted}} Devil Daggers to Steam Greenlight, {{a community}} selection system, {{so that the}} game could be released on digital distribution platform Steam. The game was successfully greenlit and released for Windows on 18 February 2016. On 6 July 2016, Sorath released an OS X version of Devil Daggers. Alongside this release, two new enemy types {{were added to the}} game and the Devil Daggers soundtrack was added to the game's directory. Support for vertical sync, increased field of view, and virtual surround sound via HRTF-processing were also added. On 19 September 2016, a Linux version of Devil Daggers was released along with the ability to view replays from a <b>top-down</b> perspective. The update also added more statistics such as tracking a player's total survival time across all runs.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure of Link {{plays out}} in a two-mode dynamic. The overworld, {{the area where the}} {{majority}} of the action occurs in other The Legend of Zelda games, is still from a <b>top-down</b> perspective, but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a side-scrolling view. This mode is where most of the action takes place, and, with the exception of traveling across lava and water, it is the only mode in which Link can take damage and be killed.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 3DS version {{features}} stereoscopic 3D graphics with optional cel-shaded outlines to {{make the}} characters more visible. The game also features two exclusive modes; Smash Run and StreetSmash. Smash Run, based on the City Trial mode from Kirby Air Ride, has players navigate an open environment, fighting computer-controlled enemies to earn stat-increasing power-ups, before facing {{each other in a}} randomly selected match, such as vertical or horizontal races against each other or battles with various special rules. StreetSmash is a StreetPass-based game in which players control a disc on a <b>top-down</b> board and attempt to knock their opponents out of the arena. The 3DS version supports the additional controls featured on the New Nintendo 3DS, such as using the C-Stick to trigger Smash Attacks, but is not compatible with the Circle Pad Pro peripheral because of hardware limitations.|$|E
