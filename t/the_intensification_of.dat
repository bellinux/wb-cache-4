5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest {{toward the}} North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the next}} two days, it slowly strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning toward the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to <b>the</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{forecasts}} significantly underestimated <b>the</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> Emilia, {{which was}} one of three tropical cyclones to attain Category5 status in the central Pacific during the season. On July 16, a 72-hour forecast misjudged the strengthening of Emilia by 41m/s (92mph). Later, winds at 72hours were 31m/s (69mph) too high when the cyclone began to weaken. Tropical cyclone forecast models consistently predicted Emilia to remain south of the Hawaiian Islands because of the upper troughs' climatologically weak nature during the summer. This led to high confidence in the forecasts, resulting in a lack of watches or warnings. Nonetheless, a high surf advisory was issued for the south and east coasts of all islands.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, {{horses were}} {{harvested}} from the feral herds {{and used as}} riding and stock horses, {{as well as being}} used for their meat, hair and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native Māori, but many were eradicated with <b>the</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses.

5|$|The saxaul sparrow {{is found}} in remote parts of Central Asia, where its {{distribution}} is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It {{is found in}} deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or tamarisk (Tamarix). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

5|$|Tropical Storm Morakot, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Juaning, brought {{significant}} rainfall to Taiwan before alleviating drought conditions in mainland China in August2003. The tenth named storm in the western Pacific that year, Morakot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July31. Tracking northwest, favorable conditions allowed for <b>the</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> the system to tropical storm strength on August2. Morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system; {{this was followed by}} Morakot making landfall on southern Taiwan on August3. Subsequently, the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near Quanzhou, China the next day. The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland, and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall.|$|E

There he witnessed the fire of Vilnius, which required the royal family to evacuate their residence in the Vilnius Castle. Shortly afterwords, that year, Władysław, aged 15, was elected Tsar by Muscovy's aristocracy council of Seven boyars, who overthrew tsar Vasily Shuysky during the Polish-Muscovite War and Muscovy's Time of Troubles. His election was ruined by his father, Sigismund, who aimed to convert Muscovy's population from Orthodox religion to Catholicism. Sigismund refused {{to agree to the}} boyar's request to send prince Władysław to Moscow and his conversion to Orthodoxy. Instead, Sigismund proposed that he should reign as a regent in Muscovy instead. This unrealistic proposal led to a resumption of hostilities. Briefly, beginning in 1610, Władysław struck Muscovite silver and gold coins (Kopek) in the Russian mints in Moscow and Novgorod with his titulary Tsar and Grand Prince Vladislav Zigimontovych of all Russia.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in <b>the</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{increasing}} <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> {{dairy farming}} in Europe has sparked {{an interest in}} studying the economic consequences of this process. However, empirically classifying farms as extensive or intensive is not a straightforward task. In recent papers, Latent Class Models (LCM) {{have been used to}} avoid an ad-hoc split of the sample into intensive and extensive dairy farms. A limitation of current specifications of LCM is that they do not allow farms to switch between different productive systems over time. This feature of the model is at odds with <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European dairy industry in recent decades. We allow for changes of production system over time by estimating a single LCM model but splitting the original panel into two periods, and find that the probability of using the intensive technology increases over time.
