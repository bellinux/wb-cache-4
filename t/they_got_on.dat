5|$|The {{victim of}} poor field position, Ball State {{executed}} only three plays, {{the last of}} which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1-yard line. Nevertheless, Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards, but a 10-yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State's territory. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the score board on that drive via a 41-yard field goal kick by Brian Davis, making the score 7–3 Ball State. On their ensuing drive, Ball State executed another extended drive, this one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards (highlighted by another 20+ yard rush by Edwards); it failed to reach the end zone, but all was not lost, as Scott Secor made a 26-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points. The drive encompassed 6:09. Arkansas State responded, embarking on a 9-play, 63-yard drive that was highlighted by a 27-yard rush by R.J. Fleming, and climaxed when Sirgregory Thornton rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half. The half time score was 10–10.|$|E
500|$|On March 7, 2000, {{the contestants}} were flown to Los Angeles, {{then to the}} city of Kota Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo. From there, they were taken by boat to their island.

The two tribes shared the island of Tiga, which was divided by over [...] of forest. The castaways were {{surrounded}} by wildlife such as pythons, kraits, adders, monkeys, monitor lizards, and white-bellied sea eagles. The show was set to air in the summer of 2000.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard became Parsons' [...] "magical partner" [...] for a sex magic ritual {{involving}} {{that was}} intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess. Although <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well as fellow occultists, tensions {{between the two men}} were apparent in more domestic settings. Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard [...] "living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when {{the two of them were}} sitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible." [...] Despite the tensions between them, Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of [...] "Allied Enterprises", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing. Hubbard and Northrup left for Florida towards the end of April, taking with him $10,000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership's first yacht. Weeks passed without word from Hubbard. Louis Culling, another O.T.O. member, wrote to Karl Germer to explain the situation: ...|$|E

500|$|Through {{their work}} at The Warlock Shop, Buczynski and Slater came {{to meet and}} befriend Judith and Thomas Kneital (also known by their craft names of Theos and Phoenix), who had {{recently}} taken control of the Long Island coven of Gardnerians in New York after the former high priest and high priestess, Raymond Buckland and his wife Rosemary, had decided to divorce. In early 1973, the shop hit financial difficulty, and the Kneitals personally lent several thousand dollars to Slater and Buczynski {{in order to help}} them out, which Buczynski promptly paid back. Their business quickly recovered, and they employed a young man from New Orleans named Robert Carey to work in the shop; he was a close personal friend of Candy Darling, and used to visit The Factory, where he was known as [...] "Chanel 13". The increasing relationship between Slater and Buczynski and the Kneitals led to socialising between their two covens; despite their differing class backgrounds (the Gardnerian Commack coven being largely middle class and the Welsh Traditionalist Brooklyn Heights coven being largely working class and counter-cultural), <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well. In February 1973, Buczynski requested initiation into the Gardnerican Craft from the Kneitals, but they refused, being cautious of what uses he would put the Gardnerian liturgy to.|$|E
500|$|Schafer {{credited}} both LucasArts and Disney {{for help}} in creating the remaster, which follows from a similar remastering of Grim Fandango, as well by Double Fine, in January 2015. Schafer said when they originally were about to secure the rights to Grim Fandango from LucasArts to make the remaster, {{they did not originally}} have plans to redo the other LucasArts adventure games, but with the passionate response <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the news of the Grim Fandango remaster, they decided to continue these efforts. Schafer described getting the rights to Day of the Tentacle a [...] "miracle" [...] though aided by {{the fact that many of}} the executives in the legal rights chain had fond memories of playing these games and helped to secure the rights. Schafer has expressed interest in continuing to restore these older titles, listing Full Throttle as his next goal, which is also confirmed to release in the future. 2 Player Productions, which has worked before with Double Fine to document their game development process, also created a mini-documentary for Day of the Tentacle Remastered, which included a visit to the Skywalker Ranch, where LucasArts games were originally developed, where much of the original concept art and digital files for the game and other LucasArts adventure games were archived.|$|E

2500|$|According to the BBC's head {{of drama}} series, Mal Young, {{the family was}} brought in as the serial did not [...] "have enough solid {{families}} in the soap, {{there were a lot}} of fractured families and people who were alone." [...] Ryan was cast in the role of Zoe after the character was developed at an improvisation session for thirty actors and actresses earlier in the year. He choose Lordan, Wallace, [...] Ainsworth, Ryan and Lakey as the five sisters as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> so well at the sessions. The actors performed a Nolan Sister's routine at the session, which was [...] "later included on EastEnders as part of one of the Queen Vic's karaoke nights". The character is described as bolshy, defiant and a vivacious teenager who makes an impression on the men of Walford.|$|E
2500|$|DreamWorks {{executive}} Stacey Snider suggested Richard Curtis {{to work on}} rewrites for the screenplay: she {{had worked}} with Curtis during her time at Universal Studios, and Curtis had previously written the World War I-set BBC comedy television series Blackadder Goes Forth along with Ben Elton which meant he was already familiar with the period. Spielberg was a fan of Blackadder but had never met Curtis. Curtis was initially reluctant to take part, but on meeting Spielberg <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> so well that Curtis rethought and committed {{to work on the}} script. Curtis has stated that the screenplay is closer to the book than the play, and that 'the existence of the play itself helped him [...] "be brave" [...] about his own adaptation.' Curtis produced more than a dozen drafts in three months, and has spoken of the close collaboration he had with Spielberg while working on the script.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{attention}} created by this release and because of the strong live reputation they had built up through constant UK touring, a bidding war for the band ensued between major record labels. The band decided to sign with Island Records in the summer of 2003. After first being attracted to the band by the considerable industry buzz then surrounding them and from hearing [...] "Everybody's Changing" [...] on the radio, the Island A, Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, told HitQuarters that he wanted to sign them after hearing the five songs [...] "Everybody’s Changing", [...] "This Is the Last Time", [...] "She Has No Time", [...] "Bend and Break" [...] and [...] "Somewhere Only We Know", saying that: [...] "every one of them was brilliant ... they had a fantastic live show [...] even if I hadn't been able to see them live, I would have tried to sign them anyway." [...] According to Unger-Hamilton, Keane chose to sign with Island because <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well with the A and were convinced {{that he did not want}} to change them in any way.|$|E

2500|$|Producers {{established}} a friendship between Lofty and consultant Dylan Keogh (William Beck). Mead said he enjoyed scenes with Beck because <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well. He {{said that the}} difference between Lofty's [...] "awkwardness and sincerity" [...] and Dylan's [...] "very dry and direct" [...] approach made [...] "a good contrast". Mead revealed that he and Beck often kept [...] "getting the giggles" [...] in takes. In a 2015 interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Hossington teased the show's Christmas episode and revealed that Lofty and Dylan would feature in what would be [...] "the most fantastic ending". She added that [...] "people will be talking about [...] for a very long time!" [...] In late 2015, Hossington said she enjoyed Lofty's relationship with Dylan and described them as [...] "the odd couple" [...] with a [...] "fun bromance". Mead noted that the pairing was [...] "strange" [...] yet [...] "quite special", which was amusing and hoped that following his move to Holby City, he would appear in Casualty to develop Lofty's friendship with Dylan. He told Brown (Radio Times) that the characters formed a [...] "funny bond" [...] and found them a strange pairing that developed over time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Ross and mega-tour {{promoter}} SFX (which {{later became}} LiveNation) began negotiations regarding a Diana Ross tour {{which would include}} a Supremes segment. [...] Due to public response, the promoters floated {{the idea of a}} Supremes Tour instead. [...] Some fans suggested a Supremes tour in which all living former Supremes would participate. Neither Jean Terrell nor late 1970s member Susaye Greene chose to participate. Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne were then touring as members of the Former Ladies of the Supremes. Mary Wilson agreed to begin negotiations, as did Cindy Birdsong. Negotiations, however, to have the 1967–70 lineup of the group perform {{together for the first time}} in a concert tour since 1970 failed when Wilson and SFX could not come to terms. SFX hired Payne and Laurence to sing with Ross on the tour. [...] Ross, Payne, and Laurence had never performed together during their Supremes' tenures. Laurence and Payne would later say <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well with Ross. The Return to Love tour launched in June 2000, to a capacity audience in Philadelphia. Diana Ross had just appeared on the Oprah Show, and then the whole group sang. [...] It was very apparent that this group had little resemblance to the old Diana Ross and the Supremes. [...] Instead of driving ticket sales, it hurt them. [...] The reunion tour, never made it through the first half due to poor reviews and a public lack of ticket sales.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get on the bus and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. [...] "When you play a great team like that, you always have the chances of obviously this happening,” Dodge said. [...] "Give credit where credit is due – a great Oklahoma football team. Um ... Wow! Very, very impressive.” ...|$|E
