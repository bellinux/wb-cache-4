5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean <b>that</b> <b>running</b> was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 1847 {{the company}} {{acquired}} {{control of the}} Paisley and Renfrew Railway under the Paisley & Renfrew Railway Sale and Improvement Act. ,. The purchase had earlier been agreed by the proposed Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet Railway, supported by the GPK, for £34,000. It was horse-operated and had a track gauge of 4ft4in (1,321mm). The line was loss-making and had no practical value other than the tactical one of securing territory against competing companies. The Paisley Barrhead and Hurlet Bill failed in the 1847 session of Parliament and was re-presented in 1848; the share capital proposed had risen to £230,000; during the Lords' hearings it became plain <b>that</b> <b>running</b> powers {{were likely to be}} granted to the Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, an offshoot of the Caledonian Railway. The GPK had subscribed to £150,000 in face value of the shares of this proposed line, with the sole intention of excluding the Caledonian Railway from the area. The GPK now petitioned against the Bill, but this was unsuccessful, and it received the Royal Assent, with the running powers clause, on 31 August 1848.|$|E

25|$|Although Mackenzie {{composed}} {{a large number}} of works, which met with great public success, he found, as had Arthur Sullivan earlier and as did Parry contemporaneously, <b>that</b> <b>running</b> a large musical conservatoire left less time for composition. Both at the Academy and elsewhere, he was a popular lecturer. Among his topics were Verdi's opera Falstaff, the text of his lecture on which was later published in translation in Italy. Outliving his contemporaries Sullivan and Parry, he gave memorial lectures on their lives and works. At a time when Sullivan's reputation in academic musical circles was not high, Mackenzie's tribute was generous and enthusiastic.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} the Troubles lessened {{during the early stages}} of the Northern Ireland Peace Process, and {{especially}} following the demilitarisation of the South-Armagh region. The Troubles are widely seen to have ended with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, but not definitively so until the deadly Omagh bombing of August that year, which saw 29 people killed. A minor connection between the area and that tragedy was that one of the two telephone warnings made by the Real IRA with respect to that attack was made from the BT telephone box at McGeough's crossroads in the south of the district, where the Aughanduff Road meets <b>that</b> <b>running</b> from Newry to Crossmaglen.|$|E
25|$|After the dreadfully {{desultory}} affair at the Sydney Football Stadium {{a fortnight}} before, the ten-try bonanza {{turned on by}} the two sides at Ballymore was a timely reminder <b>that</b> <b>running</b> rugby, {{with the emphasis on}} the players and not the whistle, was what the public wanted. Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia. A close study of the video replay shows that Norling made at least six major mistakes, five of which led to points being scored. Nevertheless he was hailed as a hero for his willingness to let the players be the stars.|$|E
25|$|Another {{court case}} that {{paved the way}} for the IGRA was in the mid-1980s when the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians started a small bingo parlor and card club on their {{southern}} California reservation. Although the state attempted to shut down these gambling operations, the Cabazon tribe filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming that such an action was illegal in light of prior court rulings and the sovereign rights of the reservation. The state, on the other hand, argued <b>that</b> <b>running</b> such a high-stakes gambling organization was illegal and therefore punishable as a criminal violation of law, in accordance with Public Law 280. The Cabazon case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
