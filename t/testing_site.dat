5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station.

5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>site</b> by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in the area, are resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{differentiate}} an allergic patch test response from an irritant response, we evaluated by flow cytometry the percentages of various epidermal cell populations isolated from allergen and irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> Nine allergic individuals were patch tested with various allergens (Rhus, dinitrochlorobenzene [DNCB], or nickel chloride) and a vehicle control for 48 h. Eight additional individuals were patch tested with irritating chemicals (sodium lauryl sulfate or nonanoic acid) and with a vehicle control for 48 h. Epidermal cells, isolated from suction blisters, were double labeled for CD 1 /HLA-DR, CD 3 /HLA-DR, or CD 36 /HLA-DR cell surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of various cell populations. A mean increase of 0. 91 ± 0. 3 {{in the percentage of}} DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was detected in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> in allergic individuals, whereas a decrease of 0. 19 ± 0. 2 in the percentage of DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells from the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was detected in irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> Epidermal cells from allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> also exhibited an increase of 5. 2 ± 1. 8 in percentage of DR+CD 1 - cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> compared to an increase change of 0. 8 ± 0. 4 in epidermal cells isolated from irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> We also found that DR+ cells that lacked the CD 1 determinant expressed the macrophage/monocyte antigen CD 36 (OKM 5). Finally, a 2. 3 ± 0. 8 increase in the percentage of DR-CD 3 + cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was observed in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> compared to an increase of 0. 2 ± 0. 2 observed in irritant- treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> These results demonstrate a significant increase in DR+CD 1 +, DR+CD 1 -CD 36 +, and DR-CD 3 + epidermal cells in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> compared to irritant patch <b>test</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

Reunited with their father, the pair soon return to Rivet City and recruit Li and the other project members to resume work at the Jefferson Memorial. Just as they begin testing the project, the Memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from {{the remnants of the}} pre-War United States government, which continues to remain active despite the demise of their brethren on the West Coast thirty years previously (see Fallout 2). Seeking to stop them gaining control of his work, James urges the Lone Wanderer to finish his work and find a G.E.C.K. before flooding the project's control room with massive amounts of radiation, preventing the Enclave's military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it and killing himself in the process, though Autumn survives. Taking the remaining project members to safety, the Lone Wanderer makes contact with the Brotherhood of Steel within the ruins of the Pentagon, now known as the Citadel. With their help, the Lone Wanderer travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K., which had been used as a <b>testing</b> <b>site</b> for the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) and now as a breeding ground for the Super Mutants.

40|$|Evidence of tectonic release {{produced}} by underground nuclear explosions at Novaya Zemlya {{is present in}} teleseismic, long-period S waves. SH waveforms from representative events at the Southern and Northern Novaya Zemlya <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> were modeled to determine the SH radiation patterns. Long-peded P and SV waves were also investigated to further constrain the equivalent double-couple orientation of the tectonic release. Events within each <b>test</b> <b>site</b> have similar faulting mechanisms, but there are definite differences in the tectonic release orientation between the two <b>sites.</b> The southem <b>test</b> <b>site</b> double-couple orientation is either vertical strike slip or 45 °-dipping thrust, while the northem <b>test</b> <b>site</b> has an oblique-normal dip slip orientation.
