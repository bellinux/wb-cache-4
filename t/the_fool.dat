5|$|As {{he works}} with SEES, the protagonist builds up the Social Link for <b>the</b> <b>Fool</b> Arcana, which symbolizes {{beginning}} and infinite possibilities of the journey ahead. When the protagonist decides to spare Ryoji Mochizuki, the Social Link of <b>the</b> <b>Fool</b> Arcana changes into the Judgement Arcana, which symbolizes {{the end of his}} journey and looking back at what has transpired this far. The final Social Link the protagonist attains is the Universe Arcana, a card from the Thoth tarot that replaces World Arcana, symbolizing the full awareness of the protagonist's place in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Relapse, or, Virtue in Danger is a Restoration comedy from 1696 {{written by}} John Vanbrugh. The play is {{a sequel to}} Colley Cibber's Love's Last Shift, or, <b>The</b> <b>Fool</b> in Fashion.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play <b>the</b> <b>fool,</b> as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
50|$|They {{think that}} they have pacified Ireland. They {{think that they}} have {{purchased}} half of us and intimidated the other half. They {{think that they have}} foreseen everything, think that they have provided against everything; but, <b>the</b> <b>fools,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fools,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fools!</b> — They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.|$|R

5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Fool's</b> Guard, <b>the</b> {{point of}} the sword is lowered to the ground, {{appearing}} to [...] "foolishly" [...] expose the upper {{parts of the body}} and inviting an attack. Although <b>the</b> <b>Fool's</b> Guard exposes <b>the</b> upper openings, it does provide excellent protection to the lower openings. From <b>the</b> <b>Fool's</b> Guard an attack or displacement can be made with the false edge of the sword, or the hilt of the sword can be quickly raised into a hanging parry.|$|R
5|$|The Starrs {{lived there}} until Epstein's {{accountant}} {{suggested that the}} group members should move to houses near his, in Esher. On 24July1965, Starr bought Sunny Heights for £30,000 ($72,000), on South Road, St George's Hill, but retained the lease on the flat. He rented the flat to <b>The</b> <b>Fool,</b> who were employed by Apple for various endeavours, such as painting the Apple Boutique in Baker Street, London, and designing psychedelic clothes for all four Beatles, as well as The Hollies, Marianne Faithfull, Procol Harum, Donovan, and Cream.|$|E
5|$|The miniseries also {{features}} several guest actors lending their voices to various characters. Sugar, {{in addition to}} her role as songwriter, was also brought on board to voice Marceline's mother; this role marks her first foray into voice acting. Other guest stars include Rebecca Romijn as Empress Eyes, Billy Brown as the Vampire King, Paul Williams as the Hierophant, Ron Funches as <b>the</b> <b>Fool,</b> Beau Billingslea as the Moon, Kyle Kinane as Cloud Dance, and Ava Acres as Young Marceline and the rabbit-hatted child.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of <b>the</b> <b>fool,</b> placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E

5000|$|Pádraig Pearse, who was {{involved}} in the 1916 revolution in Dublin had a cottage in Rosmuc where he wrote many of his pieces. It was in Rosmuc that he wrote his famous oration given at the grave of Ó Donnabháin Rosa (O'Donovan Rossa) in 1915, which included the immortal words [...] " ... but, <b>the</b> <b>fools,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fools,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fools!</b> — They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace." ...|$|R

5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: <b>The</b> <b>Fool</b> is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{hosted the}} orchestral session as a 1960s-style happening, with guests {{including}} Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Donovan, Pattie Boyd, Michael Nesmith, {{and members of}} the psychedelic design collective <b>The</b> <b>Fool.</b> Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: <b>the</b> <b>Fool</b> (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing <b>the</b> <b>Fool</b> and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he always does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Persona 3. He {{moves into the}} Iwatodai dorm, {{learning}} {{of his ability to}} summon the Personas Orpheus and Thanatos of The Death Arcana when the dorm is attacked by Shadows during the Dark Hour. Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in that he has the Wild Card ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of <b>the</b> <b>Fool</b> Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create a new and more powerful one. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Social Links with characters in-game are represented by one of the Major Arcana and grants various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle.|$|E
5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky <b>the</b> <b>Fool,</b> the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fool</b> {{does not}} follow any ideology. He rejects all appearances, of law, justice, moral order. He sees brute force, cruelty and lust. He has no illusions and does not seek {{consolation}} {{in the existence of}} natural or supernatural order, which provides for the punishment of evil and the reward of good. Lear, insisting on his fictitious majesty, seems ridiculous to him. All the more ridiculous because he does not see how ridiculous he is. But <b>the</b> <b>Fool</b> does not desert his ridiculous, degraded king, and accompanies him on his way to madness. <b>The</b> <b>Fool</b> knows that the only true madness is to recognize this world as rational.|$|E
2500|$|Greater fool theory {{states that}} bubbles {{are driven by}} the {{behavior}} of a perennially optimistic market participants (<b>the</b> <b>fools)</b> who buy overvalued assets in anticipation of selling it to other speculators (<b>the</b> greater <b>fools)</b> at a much higher price. According to this explanation, the bubbles continue as long as <b>the</b> <b>fools</b> can find greater fools to pay up for the overvalued asset. The bubbles will end only when <b>the</b> greater <b>fool</b> becomes <b>the</b> greatest <b>fool</b> who pays <b>the</b> top price for the overvalued asset and can no longer find another buyer to pay for it at a higher price. [...] This theory is popular among laity but has not yet been fully confirmed by empirical research.|$|R
