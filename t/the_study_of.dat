5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology is <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, {{the cultivation of}} fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses on <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> fossil plants, but traditionally includes <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to specific forms of poems, poetry is {{often thought of}} in terms of different genres and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics.

Others view <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> genres as <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> how different works relate and refer to other works.|$|E
