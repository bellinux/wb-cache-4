5000|$|It is {{critical}} to avoid over-tightening the nut or else {{the integrity of the}} compression fitting will be compromised by the excessive force. If the nut is overtightened the ferrule will deform improperly causing the joint to fail. Indeed, overtightening is {{the most common cause of}} leaks in compression fittings. A good rule of thumb is to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> first by hand until it is too difficult to continue and then <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> one half-turn more with the aid of a wrench; the actual amount varies with the size of the fitting, as a larger one requires less tightening. The fitting is then tested: if slight weeping is observed, the fitting is gradually tightened until the weeping stops.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the details}} of an {{experimental}} method to measure the clamping force value at bolted connections due to application of wrenching torque to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> have been presented. A simplified bolted joint including a holed plate with a single bolt was considered {{to carry out the}} experiments. This method was designed based on Hooke’s law by measuring compressive axial strain of a steel bush placed between the nut and the plate. In the experimental procedure, the values of clamping force were calculated for seven different levels of applied torque, and this process was repeated three times for each level of the torque. Moreover, the effect of lubrication of threads on the clamping value was studied using the same method. In both conditions (dry and lubricated threads), relation between the torque and the clamping force have been displayed in graphs.

40|$|This degree {{project was}} {{conducted}} in collaboration with Gremo AB located in Ätran. The aim {{of the project was}} to develop a solution to secure quality and to help assembling the locknut holding the vertical hinge on the harvesters and foresters from Gremo. At this time the nut is assembled manually by the aid of an overhead crane. The nut is tightened differently from time to time, and there was no specified torque to which it is tightened. Another present problem was the locking washer which sometimes gets damaged during assembly, when this happens the procedure has to be started over from the beginning. The current assembly procedure is very time consuming and lengthy for the employees. Our task was to design a machine that could <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> to a specified torque with a margin of error of ± 3 %. The assembly procedure will be held simple and the time required at a minimum. The project started by developing several principle solutions, the one solution that best matched our specifications were developed to a primary solution. Today we have started manufacturing and assembling our prototype. Our goal is that the equipment will be taken into use by Gremo...|$|E
50|$|Loosely speaking, torque is {{a measure}} of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a flywheel. For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench {{connected}} to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or <b>tightens</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> or bolt.|$|R

50|$|A square style clip-on nut {{does not}} clip onto {{the edge of}} the sheet metal, but rather the edges of a square hole or slot. It is a square nut that has a sheet metal {{retainer}} that protrudes down two sides of <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> These legs are formed to have lips that grab onto the sheet metal object. Prior to <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut,</b> it can float in the hole or slot, but when <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> is <b>tightened</b> it presses <b>the</b> lips of the retainer out and anchors itself in place.|$|R
50|$|The {{fastener}} {{serves the}} functions of both a lock washer and a <b>nut.</b> As <b>the</b> fastener is <b>tightened</b> in <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> <b>the</b> prongs are drawn inward until they exert pressure on {{the root of the}} thread on the fastener.

Standards for tightening procedures for large diameter anchor bolts are proposed. These bolts, 38 mm (I 1 / 2 in.) in diameter or greater, are widely used in highway appurtenance.

5000|$|Dholki {{is similar}} to the Dholak as the heads are a bit more developed.

The combination of the bass and treble tones is very pleasing. The heads are kept in place by metal hooks that have <b>nuts</b> at <b>the</b> bottom that can be tightened or loosened to adjust the pitch of the head. This makes changing the heads very quick. It is required to take caution while tuning as it is very easy to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> too much resulting in head breakage. The Dholki's higher-pitched head is a simple membrane while the bass head, played usually with the left hand, has a compound syahi to lower the pitch and enable the typical Dholki sliding sound ("giss" [...] or [...] "gissa"), often the caked residue of mustard oil pressing, to which some sand and oil or tar may be added.|$|R

50|$|Wobble blade or wobble dado or {{adjustable}} dado {{consists of}} a circular blade mounted on an adjustable multi-piece hub, that varies {{the angle of the}} blade to the arbor shaft. The width of the dado cut increases as the angle gets farther from the radial normal (90°) to the arbor. While it is possible to adjust the thickness of the cut while the saw is mounted on the arbor, accurate adjustment is usually difficult because <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> arbor <b>nut</b> often changes <b>the</b> adjustment. Also, because of their inherent geometry wobble blades can only produce a flat-bottomed dado at one width setting, which may be a disadvantage in certain joinery operations. Another disadvantage of a wobble dado over stacked dado is undesirable vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations varies with the blade's angular offset. In other words, the wider the dado, the stronger the vibrations.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{equipment}} for bolting, {{there are two main}} methods for increasing bolt’s prestress (Kang and Wang 2007): one is to increase <b>the</b> bolt-nut <b>tightening</b> torque; <b>the</b> second is to use a bolt tensioning device, which is similar to imposing large prestresses on anchor bolts. The methods for improving bolt-nut tightening torque include: (1) high torque jumbolter. With a high torque jumbolter, it can not only increase <b>the</b> bolt <b>tightening</b> torque, but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed. For instance, the torque of the jumbolter used with continuous miner can reach more than 300  N m. The rated torque of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150  N m, and unable to meet the requirement of high <b>tightening</b> torque of <b>the</b> bolt. (2) Torque multiplier. In order to improve the installation torque of the jumbolter, a torque multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tightening</b> torque when installing bolt. (3) Torque wrench. Using a large torque preload wrench to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> bolts and <b>nuts</b> is an effective way to improve the prestress of anchor bolts.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of reducing the consumption of electrical energy of the impact screwdriver during the assembly of fixed threaded joints.

By varying the set speed of the rotor head and working time of the impact mechanism, there is an opportunity to determine electrical energy consumption of the tool for <b>the</b> given <b>tightening</b> moment. <b>The</b> results of the experiment show that at <b>the</b> same <b>tightening</b> moment obtained <b>the</b> electrical energy consumption of the impact screwdriver is less at a higher starting set speed of the rotor head but shorter operating time of the impact mechanism than at a lower speed of the rotor head and longer operating time of the impact mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> spanner <b>nuts</b> required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench tool adapter that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto <b>the</b> <b>nut...</b>|$|R
40|$|The figure depicts an {{apparatus}} for mechanical testing of <b>nuts.</b> In <b>the</b> original application {{for which the}} apparatus was developed, <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> are of a frangible type designed for use with pyrotechnic devices in spacecraft applications {{in which there are}} requirements for rapid, one-time separations of structures that are bolted together. The apparatus {{can also be used to}} test nonfrangible nuts engaged without pyrotechnic devices. This apparatus was developed to replace prior testing systems that were extremely heavy and immobile and characterized by long setup times (of the order of an hour for each nut to be tested). This apparatus is mobile, and the setup for each test can now be completed in about five minutes. The apparatus can load a nut under test with a static axial force of as much as 6. 8 x 10 (exp 5) lb (3. 0 MN) and a static moment of as much as 8. 5 x 10 (exp 4) lb in. (9. 6 x 10 (exp 3) N(raised dot) m) for a predetermined amount of time. In the case of a test of a frangible <b>nut,</b> <b>the</b> pyrotechnic devices can be exploded to break <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> while <b>the</b> load is applied, in which case the breakage of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> relieves <b>the</b> load. The apparatus can be operated remotely for safety during an explosive test. The load-generating portion of the apparatus is driven by low-pressure compressed air; the remainder of the apparatus is driven by 110 -Vac electricity. From its source, the compressed air is fed to the apparatus through a regulator and a manually operated valve. The regulated compressed air is fed to a pneumatically driven hydraulic pump, which pressurizes oil in a hydraulic cylinder, thereby causing a load to be applied via a hydraulic nut (not to be confused with <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> under test). During operation, the hydraulic pressure is correlated with the applied axial load, which is verified by use of a load cell. Prior to operation, one end of a test stud (which could be an ordinary threaded rod or bolt) is installed in <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>nut.</b> <b>The</b> other end of the test stud passes through a bearing plate; a load cell is slid onto that end, and then <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> to be tested is threaded onto that end and <b>tightened</b> until <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and load cell press gently against the bearing plate...|$|R

These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self <b>tightening.</b> <b>The</b> wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and vice versa.
