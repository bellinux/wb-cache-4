50|$|Saucedo {{was first}} seen playing with <b>The</b> <b>Ambassadors.</b> He {{remained}} with <b>The</b> <b>Ambassadors</b> full-time {{for many years}} until he began performing music different from The King of Rock 'n' Roll. Saucedo performed his own original music and music of The Beatles in the 1980s with his band, Redwing. When {{he returned to the}} Elvis format, Saucedo played with pick-up bands and cycled through other bands. In the 1990s, following the breakup of Redwing, Saucedo played again with <b>The</b> <b>Ambassadors,</b> now called <b>The</b> Fabulous <b>Ambassadors.</b> Saucedo always performed with a band until 1997 when he played a one-month-long engagement in Aruba at the Alahambra Casino. With no band available for the engagement, Rick decided to use backing tracks. Performing each night for one month, Saucedo used backing tracks and showed that he was enjoying them more. Upon returning to the states, Saucedo began entering the stage with no equipment but a microphone and speakers. He had made the switch from band to backing tracks. Saucedo uses tracks everywhere he performs except at fests and theatres. For larger venues, he uses live bands. Since switching to tracks in 1997, Saucedo has cycled among three bands: <b>The</b> <b>Ambassadors,</b> <b>The</b> EAS Band and The Change of Habit Tribute Band. Saucedo played with EAS from the late 90s through 2004. Since 2004, it has been Rick Saucedo and the Change of Habit Tribute Band.
