5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction {{of the value of}} the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2006 Gallup poll, 84% {{of investors}} believe that illegal {{immigrants}} mostly take low paying jobs that Americans do not want. However, nearly 62% of investors say {{illegal immigration is}} hurting the investment climate. 68% of investors say that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers too much because they use government services like public education and medical services, while 25% say <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> illegal immigrants become productive citizens who come to make up paying {{their fair share of}} taxes.

25|$|Salinity {{is another}} {{important}} water quality issue. Drainage return flows to the Nile result {{in an increase in}} salinity of the water from 250 ppm (mg/l) at Aswan to 2,700 ppm at the Delta barrages. However, more salts are being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea than are entering at Aswan (see Irrigation for agriculture in Egypt) so <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> the salinity of the water at the Delta barrages could decrease. However, saline groundwater of marine origin enters the Delta through pumping of brackish water and upwelling in lakes and drains, thus counterbalancing this effect.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> output and growth will be lower than it would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country the benefits {{to be gained from}} specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: Domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E
30|$|In this context, {{some studies}} [27, 30] {{show that the}} use of micro-RES to charge the EV may be {{feasible}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short term, and thus reduce electricity demand at home, also reducing the need for costly upgrades of the network. However, these studies also reveal <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term, updates will be necessary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. <b>That</b> is, the energy production from renewable sources, without smart charge, {{will not be able to}} meet the increased demand due to the EV.|$|R
30|$|Scenario {{results suggest}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> all {{countries}} employment ratios {{are expected to}} increase, but only <b>in</b> Tunisia is <b>the</b> size of the non-employed population—our indicator of migration pressure—expected to decline, irrespective of the scenario. Depending on the scenario, migration pressure remains high in Turkey and Morocco and may even become somewhat higher. The general conclusion is <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term, after 2035, labour migration pressure {{can be expected to}} decrease because the growth and size of the working-age population is decreasing while employment ratios are rising.|$|R

25|$|The victory did {{not bring}} {{strategic}} advantages to Hannibal. Judging <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> he could not retain Herdonia, the Carthaginian general decided to resettle its population in Metapontum and Thurii {{to the south and}} destroy the city itself. Before that he set an example to other eventual traitors by executing some of the distinguished citizens who had conspired to betray Herdonia to Centumalus. For {{the rest of the summer}} he was forced to fight off the second Roman army. The next battle with Marcellus at Numistro was inconclusive and Hannibal was unable to regain the positions lost at the beginning of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|For an {{overview}} {{on the different}} perspectives concerning optimal balance {{between public and private}} power in the economy, see liberal, realist & Marxist. For more detail on specific systems of thought relevant to debate on this fiscal policy see Keynesian economics, Monetarism, the Austrian School, New classical macroeconomics, Real business-cycle theory, and New Keynesian economics. A key common feature of the anti-Keynesian schools of thought is that they argued for policy ineffectiveness or policy irrelevance. Although the theoretical justifications vary, the various schools all hold that government intervention will be much less effective than Keynes had believed, with some advocates even claiming <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> interventionist policy will always be counterproductive.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{negative}} {{answer to the}} halting problem shows that there are problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine, the Church–Turing thesis limits what {{can be accomplished by}} any machine that implements effective methods. However, not all machines conceivable to human imagination are subject to the Church–Turing thesis (e.g. oracle machines). It is an open question whether there can be actual deterministic physical processes <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> elude simulation by a Turing machine, and in particular whether any such hypothetical process could usefully be harnessed {{in the form of a}} calculating machine (a hypercomputer) that could solve the halting problem for a Turing machine amongst other things. It is also an open question whether any such unknown physical processes are involved in the working of the human brain, and whether humans can solve the halting problem (Copeland 2004, p.15).|$|E

25|$|The tramway {{alternative}} has {{the easiest}} and fastest access, being located at street level. This encourages passengers which will take it between stops on Fornebu and travelers heading to Lysaker. However, the long travel time by tram to the city centers means that most travelers will switch to trains at Lysaker. Estimates show <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> the tramway alternative may not have sufficient capacity to handle all the traffic to Fornebu. The tramway {{is in the process}} of ordering new trams. One of the goals is that they can be a shelf ware. Should the Fornebu Line be built as a tramway, it would feature the only tunnels on the network. This would result in the trams having to be built in a higher fire grade, resulting in significantly higher costs for all trams for the network. Alternatively special trams for the Fornebu Line would have to be built, eliminating possibility of economy of scale.|$|E
25|$|However, the Americans had {{multiple}} advantages <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans {{had a large}} prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port {{but that did not}} give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.|$|E
500|$|In 1630, the Cossack leader, Taras Fedorovych, {{executed}} {{the moderate}} Hryhoriy Chorny, {{and began a}} Cossack uprising, later dubbed the [...] "Fedorovych Uprising". Soon afterwards he captured the fortress of Korsun. In an effort to restore the situation, Koniecpolski laid siege to Pereyaslav. Lacking artillery and infantry support, he could not breach its walls, but the Cossacks, needing supplies and having suffered heavy casualties, agreed to negotiate. The Treaty of Pereyaslav, signed in August 1630, resulted. It granted liberal terms, including amnesty for the rebels. Koniecpolski, as usual, was for harsh punishment, but also argued <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> the Cossack situation was better remedied by more equitable treatment, including {{an increase in the}} Cossack register and the regular payment of wages. Still, he supported policies aimed at turning the Cossacks into serfs, {{which was one of the}} main causes of unrest in Ukraine; this, along with his decision to settle his soldiers' living expenses on the local populace instead of paying them wages, led to his extreme unpopularity in Ukraine.|$|E
50|$|According {{to local}} {{authorities}} {{from the city}} of Oslo, the negative effects on the bus lanes occur only at certain places and in certain times of the day, particularly at the Norwegian National Road E18, west of Oslo.

Stavanger Airport had been a candidate for intercontinental travel, but a state committee in 1949 decided that instead this should be shared between Fornebu and Gardermoen. Another committee was established in 1948, and in 1950 it recommended that all airport services in the Oslo region should be concentrated at Gardermoen, and that a new motorway be built to the airport. Among politicians and planners, there were two main ideologies: The first, which dominated in political circles, stated that Fornebu's close proximity to the city center was a key to reaching a market in Oslo and for the growth of the airlines. The second emphasized <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> Fornebu could not fulfill the requirements of a central airport, and that a better location should be established.|$|E
