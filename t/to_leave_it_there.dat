A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|For this reason, {{financial}} advisers often encourage {{those who have}} the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans. One [...] "good" [...] supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored 401(K) (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans. Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a [...] "good" [...] investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into [...] "good" [...] investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> to earn compound interest until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses [...] "self correct", and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns. The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of 59½, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s). For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.|$|E

60|$|I take, then, {{this one}} {{institution}} as a test. As every normal man desires a woman, and children {{born of a}} woman, every normal man desires a house of his own to put them into. He does not merely want a roof above him and a chair below him; he wants an objective and visible kingdom; a fire at which he can cook what food he likes, a door he can open to what friends he chooses. This is the normal appetite of men; I do not say there are not exceptions. There may be saints above the need and philanthropists below it. Opalstein, now he is a duke, may have got used to more than this; {{and when he was}} a convict may have got used to less. But the normality of the thing is enormous. To give nearly everybody ordinary houses would please nearly everybody; that is what I assert without apology. Now in modern England (as you eagerly point out) {{it is very difficult to}} give nearly everybody houses. Quite so; I merely set up the desideratum; and ask the reader <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> standing <b>there</b> while he turns with me to a consideration of what really happens in the social wars of our time.|$|R

Dr Livingstone tells us that on one occasion, when he was out with a large party of natives, a troop of elephants were attacked by them, and that one of these, in running away, fell into a hole, and, before he could extricate himself, an opportunity was allowed for all the men to throw their spears. When the elephant rose he was like a huge porcupine, for each of the seventy or eighty men had discharged more than one spear at him. As they had no more, they sent for the Doctor to shoot him. He, anxious to put the animal at once out of pain, went up to within twenty yards, rested his gun on an ant-hill, so as to take steady aim; but though he fired twelve two-ounce bullets, all he had, into different parts, he could not kill it. As it was getting dark, they were obliged <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> standing <b>there,</b> intending <b>to</b> return in the morning in the full expectation of finding it dead; but though they searched all that day, and went over more than ten miles of ground, they never saw it again! ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The rationale for {{the building of the}} station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with the Oslo Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. The Oslo Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980. [...] "I did not know there was a station here. But it does not seem wise <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> unused, <b>there</b> has after all been put a lot of capital into it already." [...] Sissel Rønbeck, former Minister of Transport, then member of Parliament in Aftenposten, 22 November 1989 During the mid-1980s, the plans for Elisenberg were again considered, after an initiative by Prime Minister Kåre Willoch who had been stuck in traffic congestion at Frogner. At the time, the cost estimate to open the station was NOK 105 million. The rail administration planned instead to build an additional, western entrance to Nationaltheatret Station, located near the roundabout between Parkveien and Henrik Ibsens gate (then Drammensveien), which would only cost 40 million NOK. This entrance was expected to replace the need for Elisenberg Station, and was located {{in the middle of the}} Oslo Tunnel, between Nationaltheatret and Skøyen. Oslo Byes Vel and the Conservative, Red and Centre parties opposed the construction of the entrance, arguing that it would ruin the south-western corner of the Palace Park. The Conservative Party proposed building it further south, across Henrik Ibsens gate, either in Hansteens gate or in Parkveien near Oslo Commerce School, while the others wanted to open Elisenberg Station for traffic.|$|R

[...] "During three years past, the expense occasioned by the troops in brigade, and others commanded by European officers, has much distressed the support of my household, insomuch that the allowances made to the seraglio and children of the deceased Nabob have been reduced to one fourth of what it had been, upon which they have subsisted in a very distressed manner for two years past. The attendants, writers, and servants, &c., of my court, have received no pay for two years past; and there is at present no part of the country that can be allotted to the payment of my father's private creditors, whose applications are daily pressing upon me. All these difficulties I have for these three years past struggled through, and found this consolation therein, that it was complying with the pleasure of the Honorable Company, and {{in the hope that the}} Supreme Council would make inquiry from impartial persons into my distressed situation; but I am now forced to a representation. From the great increase of expense, the revenues were necessarily farmed out at a high rate; and deficiencies followed yearly. The country and cultivation is abandoned; and this year in particular, from the excessive drought, deductions of many lacs" [...] (stated by the Resident, in his letter to the board of the 13th of the month following, to amount to twenty-five lac, or 250,000l. sterling) [...] "have been allowed the farmers, who were still left unsatisfied.
