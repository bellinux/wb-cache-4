40|$|A {{chitosan}} resin functionalized with 3 -nitro- 4 -amino {{benzoic acid}} moiety (CCTS-NABA resin) was newly synthesized for the collection/concentration of trace molybdenum by using cross-linked chitosan (CCTS) as base material. The carboxyl {{group of the}} moiety was chemically attached to amino group of cross-linked chitosan through amide bond formation. The adsorption behavior of molybdenum {{as well as other}} 60 elements on the resin was examined by passing the sample solutions through a mini-column packed with the resin. After the elution of the elements collected on the resin with 1 M HNO 3, the eluates were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The CCTS-NABA resin can adsorb several metal ions, such as vanadium, gallium, arsenic, selenium, silver, bismuth, thorium, tungsten, tin, <b>tellurium,</b> <b>copper,</b> and molybdenum at appropriate pHs. Among these metal ions, only molybdenum could be adsorbed almost completely on the resin at acidic regions. An excellent selectivity toward molybdenum could be obtained at pH 3 - 4. The adsorption capacity of CCTS-NABA resin for Mo(VI) was 380 mg g(- 1) resin. Through the column pretreatment, alkali and alkaline earth metals in river water and seawater samples were successfully removed. The CCTS-NABA resin was applied to the adsorption/collection of molybdenum in river water and seawater samples. The concentrations of molybdenum in river water samples were found in the range of 0. 84 and 0. 95 ppb (ng g(- 1)), whereas molybdenum in seawater was about 9 ppb. The validation of the proposed method was carried out by determining molybdenum in the certified reference materials of SLRS- 4, CASS- 4, and NASS- 5 after passing through the CCTS-NABA resin; the results showed good agreement with the certified-values. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Julie deposit is {{currently}} the largest gold prospect in NW Ghana. It is hosted in sheared granitoids of TTG composition of the Paleoproterozoic Julie greenstone belt. The main mineralization consists of a corridor of gold-bearing quartz veins forming a network of a few tens of metres in thickness, trending E-W and dipping 30 - 60 degrees N, contained within the main shear zone that affects these rocks. The core of this vein corridor is altered by sericite, quartz, ankerite, calcite, tourmaline and pyrite, and is surrounded by an outer halo consisting of albite, sericite, calcite, chlorite, pyrite and rutile. Asecond set of veins, conjugate to the first set, occurs in the area. These veins have alteration halos with a similar mineralogy as the main corridor, however, their extent, {{as well as the}} size of the mineralization, is less important. In the main corridor, gold forms micron-sized grains that occur in pyrite as inclusions, on its edges, and in fractures crosscutting it.

40|$|Copper {{electrowinning}} {{plants are}} where high purity copper (Cu) product is obtained through electrochemical reduction of copper from the leaching solution. The presence selenium (Se) and <b>tellurium</b> (Te) in <b>copper</b> sulphide minerals {{may result in}} contamination of the leach solution and, eventually of the copper cathode. Unfortunately, hydrometallurgical processes are often difficult to monitor and control due to day-to-day fluctuations in the process as well as limitations in capturing the data at high frequencies. The purpose of this work is to model key variables in the copper electrowinning tank and to apply statistical fault detection to the selenium/tellurium removal and copper electrowinning process operations. First principle modeling {{was applied to the}} copper electrowinning tank and partial differential equation models were derived to describe the process dynamics. Industrial data were used to estimate the model parameters and validate the resulting models. Comparison with industrial model shows that the models fit reasonably well with industrial operation. Simulations of the models were run to explore the dynamics under varying operating conditions. The derived models provide a useful tool for future process modification and control development. Using the collected industrial operating data, dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA) based fault detection was applied to Se/Te removal and copper electrowinning processes at Vale’s Electrowinning Plant in Copper Cliff, ON. The fault detection results from the DPCA based approach were consistent with the industrial product quality test. After faults were detected, fault diagnosis was then applied to determine the causes of faults.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore new absorber and p-type window layer materials for thin-film solar cell applications. A new thin-film electron beam deposition system has been installed, is now operational, and {{has been used to}} deposit several types of solar cell absorber layers. Material investigations include iron silicon sulfide (Fe 2 SiS 4) and barium copper tin selenide (BaSn 2 SnSe 4) for absorber applications, and barium <b>copper</b> <b>tellurium</b> fluoride (BCTF) for p-type window layer applications. A key issue identified is related to difficulties associated with assessing new absorber materials without fabricating a complete, optimized solar cell. Two attempts to insert BCTFinto a thin-film solar cell were undertaken, involving copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe). The CIGS attempt was unsuccessful because of BCTF diffusion into CIGS during the CIGS deposition at 550 C. BCTF insertion into a CdTe thin-film solar cell was partially successful, as it resulted in better performance than the control cell. However, these experiments were confounded by a time-dependant degradation {{of the quality of the}} CdTe back surface after the CdTe undergoes a CdCl 2 in oxygen post-deposition treatment, which is attributed to the effects of humidity at solar cell edges. Modern Schottky barrier and heterojunction theory is used in modeling thin-film solar cells. Analysis using this theory predicts that the CdTe/gold and CIGS/molybdenum (ignoring the possibility of MoSe 2 interfacial formation) interface should form poor quality, rectifying (non- ohmic) contacts whereas the CdTe/BCTF/aluminium interface is predicted to function as a high- quality (ohmic) p-type window layer in a CdTe thin-film solar cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{processes}} of obtaining semiconductive and electrically conductive layers of mixed copper chalcogenides Cu x S–Cu y Te by the sorption-diffusion method on polyamide 6 using solutions of potassium and sodium telluropentathionates, K 2 TeS 4 O 6 and Na 2 TeS 4 O 6, and of telluropentathionic acid, H 2 TeS 4 O 6, as precursors of chalcogens (Te and S) are compared. The concentration of sorbed chalcogens increases {{with the increase}} of the duration of treatment and concentration of precursor solution in cases of all precursors used. Copper chalcogenide layers are formed on the surface of polyamide after the treatment of chalcogenized polymer with Cu(II/I) salt solution. The concentration of copper in the layer increases {{with the increase of}} initial chalcogenization duration. XRD spectra of PA films treated for different time with solutions of telluropentathionates and then with Cu(II/I) salt solution showed the maxima characteristic of the copper sulfide and <b>copper</b> telluride phases, <b>tellurium</b> sulfide TeS 7 and of elemental <b>tellurium.</b> Six <b>copper</b> sulfide phases, chalcocite, Cu 2 S, djurleite, Cu 1. 9375 S, anilite, Cu 1. 75 S, digenite, Cu 1. 80 S, villamanite, CuS 2, covelite, CuS, three copper telluride phases Cu 4 Te 3, Cu 1. 85 Te, rickardite, Cu 7 Te 5, and tellurium sulfide TeS 7 were identified in the layers formed using (0. 025 – 0. 1)  mol/dm 3 solutions of potassium telluropentathionate. Three phases of copper tellurides, tetragonal Cu 3. 18 Te 2, hexagonal Cu 2 Te and orthorhombic vulcanite, CuTe, were found in the films on PA surface formed using sodium telluropentathionate solutions, among them four phases of copper sulfides such as orthorhombic anilite, Cu 7 S 4, monoclinic djurleite, Cu 1. 9375 S, geerite, Cu 1. 6 S, orthorhombic digenite, Cu 1. 8 S, and tellurium sulfide TeS 7; the Cu–Te–S layers formed using H 2 TeS 4 O 6 solution have binary phases such as chalcocite, Cu 2 S, djurleite, Cu 1. 9375 S, anilite, Cu 1. 75 S, digenite, Cu 1. 80 S, copper telluride Cu 1. 85 Te, elemental tallurium and tellurium sulfide TeS 7. The phase composition of layers changes depending on the nature of telluropentathionate used for PA chalcogenization and conditions of treatment in precursor’ solutions. The value of electrical sheet resistance of chalcogenide layers formed using (0. 05 – 0. 1)  mol/dm 3 K 2 TeS 4 O 6 solutions varies from 256 kW/cm 2 to 1. 6  kW/cm 2 and of those formed using Na 2 TeS 4 O 6 solutions – from 3. 14 · 10 3 kW/cm 2 to ~ 1. 34  kW/cm 2; the use of H 2 TeS 4 O 6 as precursor leads to the formation of electrically conductive Cu x S–Cu y Te layers with electrical resistance in the range of (4. 34 · 10 3 – 1. 2)  kW/cm 2; the sheet resistance depends on the conditions of PA interaction with initial chalcogenization solutions.
