5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation in 1991 and an adaptation by Jon Mullich of Gilbert & Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> operetta {{in the world}} of Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold. A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The Generation After That. It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies.|$|E
5|$|While The Hobbit {{has been}} adapted and {{elaborated}} upon in many ways, its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often {{claimed to be}} its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground (Goblin Town/Moria); they engage another group of elves (The Elvenking's realm/Lothlórien); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the Dead Marshes); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men (Lake-town/Ithilien); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/Battle of Pelennor Fields); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak (Lonely Mountain/Mount Doom); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne (Bard/Aragorn); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off/the scouring of the Shire).|$|E

25|$|According to Marvin Sweeney, in its {{original}} context, {{as part of the}} Deuteronomistic history, the story exalted Solomon as a wise ruler and presented him as a model to Hezekiah. Later, the narrative context of the story has undergone another Deuteronomistic redaction that has undermined Solomon's figure in comparison to Josiah. In its current context, the story implicitly criticizes Solomon for violating the biblical law <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> priests and Levites on top of the judicial hierarchy (Deuteronomy 17:8–13).|$|E
25|$|The reserve {{requirement}} (or cash reserve ratio) {{is a central}} bank regulation employed by most, but not all, of the world's central banks, <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank. The minimum reserve is generally determined by the central bank to be no less than a specified percentage {{of the amount of}} deposit liabilities the commercial bank owes to its customers. The commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the commercial bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank.|$|E

25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising the {{retirement}} age, rather than striking to reduce the retirement age. That was not the case, however, because it is state legislation <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> terms of the pension plan, and under state law pension terms may not even be the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a retroactive inflation adjustment for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost of the pension plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{negotiation}} process starts, {{people in a}} positive mood have more confidence, and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy. During the negotiation, negotiators {{who are in a}} positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics and more cooperative strategies. This in turn increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains. Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more. Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem solving, respect for others' perspectives, willingness to take risks and higher confidence. Post-negotiation positive affect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future interactions. The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings commitment <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> stage for subsequent interactions. PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts perception of self performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it actually is. Thus, studies involving self reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} of oral tradition, numerous and even contradictory details went to enhance the character, until he became a national folk hero in both Ethiopia and Eritrea, a status he retains to this day. Among the various reconstructions, there is one <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> story during a celebratory event of {{the second anniversary of}} the announcement of the Italian empire (although the Italian empire's proclamation that made Ethiopia part of Italian East Africa was annually celebrated a month earlier, on May 9). The young Eritrean would have been chosen {{to take part in the}} military parade and carry a ceremonial sword that would have greeted the Italian king Vittorio Emanuele III, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini (although, as evidenced by the historical sources, none of the three were in Rome in those days, and in each case there was not any parade on June 15 in the capital city). Coming to the Piazza dei Cinquecento and recognizing the golden sculpture of the Lion of Judah to which his ancestors swore allegiance, Zerai would have been struck by a sudden amok or impetus of anti-colonial patriotism, deciding to stop at the steps, kneel, and pray towards the statue-symbol; or, with a sudden feeling of anger, he would hit with a sword the first Italian to cross his path.|$|E

500|$|When Weir {{wrote the}} novel The Martian, he strove {{to present the}} science {{correctly}} and used reader feedback to get it right. When Scott began directing the film, he also sought to make it realistic and received help from James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Green put together teams to answer scientific questions that Scott asked. Green said, [...] "The Martian is reasonably realistic", though he said the film's hazardous dust storm, despite reaching speeds of [...] would in reality have weak force. Green also found the NASA buildings in the film to be more stylish than the functional ones NASA actually uses. Film critics picked up {{the point that the}} Martian winds could amount to [...] "barely a light breeze" [...] in their reviews, and screenwriter Goddard agreed the winds had to be considerably exaggerated in order to set up the situation <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> story in motion.|$|E
500|$|The metaphysical {{conflicts}} {{born from}} man's isolation {{are also important}} themes throughout the story, as the characters cannot rely on a higher cause or being for protection. The correspondent laments the lack of religious support, {{as well as his}} inability to blame God for his misfortunes, musing: [...] "When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply that there are no bricks and no temples." [...] Man's perception of himself and the world around him are also constantly questioned; the correspondent regularly refers to the way things [...] "seemed" [...] or [...] "appeared", leaving how a thing actually [...] "was" [...] entirely ambiguous. Wolford similarly pointed to the importance of the story's strong yet problematic opening line—"None of them knew the color of the sky"—as one <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> scene for the story's sense of unease and uncertainty.|$|E

Producer and musician Chip Douglas has stated that he based the guitar riff for the Monkees' 1967 hit [...] "Pleasant Valley Sunday" [...] on that of the Beatles' song. Neil Innes of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band (and later the Rutles) recalls being at Abbey Road Studios while the Beatles were recording [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] and his band were working on a 1920s vaudeville song titled [...] "My Brother Makes the Noises for the Talkies". Innes said he heard the Beatles playing back [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] at full volume and appreciated then, {{in the words of}} music journalist Robert Fontenot, [...] "just how far out of their league he was, creatively". Innes has since included his recollection of this episode in his stage show.|$|E

[...] Upon the player walking over a [...] "hot spot", there's a chance of a random encounter. Enemies materialize and attack players on the same screen that they move Aya around on, with no battle mode or screen being used. In battle, the game uses a pausable real-time combat system with an Active Time Bar (ATB) <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> time that must be waited till the player can take their next action. While waiting for her turn, the player character Aya can be moved around to dodge enemy attacks. Upon each turn, the player may choose between attacking with their equipped weapon by pressing the attack button, using PE (Parasite Energy) for defense, assistance, or attack, using items, changing weapon or armor, or escaping the battle. If the player chooses to attack, the battle briefly pauses and a dome/sphere symbolizing {{the range of the}} weapon appears, allowing the player to target an enemy within range.

[...] The album opens with a brief instrumental that leads into [...] "Coast", a quiet, bass-driven track <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> stage for the album as a [...] "metaphor for Devin's newfound restraint." [...] Townsend described it as [...] "the intro to the story, quiet, dark, haunted and unsure". The track builds in intensity toward the end with layers of vocals, but rather than exploding into Strapping Young Lad–style metal, fades into [...] "loose, bluesy guitar work". [...] "Disruptr" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "a coffee-house metal track", contrasting light instrumentation with heavy metal–style songwriting and vocals in a way that one critic compared to Talking Heads. [...] "Gato" [...] proceeds in a similar vein, but is set apart with backing vocals by Dorval. [...] "Disruptr" [...] and [...] "Gato" [...] continue the musical theme; each song builds in intensity toward the end but [...] "stops and takes a deep breath" [...] before proceeding.
