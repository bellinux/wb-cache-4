500|$|The Time of Our Lives {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{earning a}} collective score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic.EP] by Miley Cyrus|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 14, 2010}} Bill Lamb of About.com said, [...] "Cyrus is developing {{one of the}} more distinctive vocal instruments in current pop music, and her songs are turning slowly to reflective adult concerns. Consistent growth and improvement is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> and looks likely to turn Miley Cyrus into a long-term pop star." [...] Lamb did, however, state that the ballads on The Time of Our Lives were throwaways. Heather Phares of Allmusic thought otherwise, saying that the EP's highlights came when Cyrus [...] "lets her inner rock chick and ballad-singing diva come to the fore." [...] Phares stated that [...] "If Breakout began to establish Miley Cyrus as a singing star in her own right, free of Hannah Montana baggage, then this Walmart Exclusive EP is another confident step in that direction." [...] Phares concluded that the EP was a good representation of Cyrus's vocal growth and presumed that her vocal abilities would enhance further as she grew into an adult. Mikeal Wood of Entertainment Weekly graded The Time of Lives a B+ because of its execution of various musical styles and genres.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Moatfield site {{provides}} a rare snapshot {{into the lives}} of Iroquonians from the 13th Century. Evidence indicates the ossuary was a cemetery for one community. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> is that it served a community, not just a family or a specific kin group, a pattern that is more typically seen in populations from this period. Health patterns observed in the remains evidence a reliance on agriculture, and this reliance changed over time. Regardless of the changes, a continuity in the relationship between the dead and the living was maintained. The socio-political patterns associated with the evolving agricultural subsistence base, are [...] reflected in the bones of Moatfield people.|$|E

2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first thing that came to my mind, as a father of two little boys, was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, I do want to incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway {{are going to be in}} there. Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E
