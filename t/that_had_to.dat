5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{successes in}} the Seven Years' War {{had left it}} with {{expensive}} commitments in the Americas <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be paid for and had catalysed {{the formation of an}} anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{be used by the}} brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals {{would never be able to}} live in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a bulldozer <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> haul itself up the ridge via a steel cable that was manhandled {{up to a point}} just below the ridge over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Junyō {{was hit by}} two bombs {{near her}} island. The ship was not badly damaged, but the damage did stop flight operations. Air Group 652 claimed 2 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 9 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers shot down, but lost 11 aircraft, plus another 3 <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ditch. By {{the end of the}} battle, the air group only {{consisted}} of 11 A6M5s, 5 A6M2s and 1 B6N and it was disbanded on 10 July. Most of its remaining personnel were assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E

5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E
5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} from the beach, a job <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be performed quickly before the tide {{came in at}} 10:30, was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed the wreckage {{out of the way}} to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|E
5|$|The Moon landing {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{by a special}} Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things picked up at a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot. The effects in the film were notably more {{intricate}} than the simple ones featured in Raimi's prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments. Tom Sullivan {{was one of the}} primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be attached to Spiegel's chest by straps and duct tape.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two British Barr and Stroud {{coincidence}} rangefinders that used two images <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be superimposed to derive the range.

5|$|This was a cashless society; the {{settlers}} bartered their stores of water, wood, vegetables, meat, fish and bird feathers for clothes, tea, sugar, tools, tobacco and other commodities not {{available on the}} island – {{but it was the}} whalers’ valuation <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be accepted. These first settlers eventually left the island when they were bought out for £350 in September 1841 by businessmen Owen Poole and Richard Dawson (later joined by John Foulis) whose employees and others then settled on the island.|$|E

5|$|While Briggs held to {{traditional}} Christian teaching in many areas, {{such as his}} belief in the virgin birth of Jesus, conservatives were alarmed by his assertion that doctrines were historical constructs <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change over time. He did not believe that the Pentateuch was authored by Moses or that the book of Isaiah had a single author. In addition, he also denied that biblical prophecy was a precise prediction of the future. In 1891, Briggs preached a sermon in which he claimed the Bible contained errors, a position many in the church considered contrary to the Westminster Confession's doctrines of verbal inspiration and biblical inerrancy.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace Attorney Investigations had taken longer than usual for an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E

5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations {{played a key role in}} the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.|$|E
5|$|At dusk, the Japanese {{turned away}} to the {{northwest}} to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance.

They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ditch. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E
