In preparation for the role, Armand watched Marvel's The Avengers, and took gym classes. About working on the show, Armand said [...] "The pressure is always on for me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> work, no matter what I do. That’s just who I am. It started to seep in just how big this show was while I {{was working on the}} set, when I went to Stockholm, Sweden and coming back home to [...] [...] was talking about the show and there were posters everywhere advertising it ...

500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool who has {{spent a lot of}} his life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided I was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E

On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

500|$|On the tour, {{the dynamic}} nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was {{described}} as aloof from his teammates {{and he did not}} offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw. Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became a [...] "reluctant hero". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that [...] "embarrassed" [...] him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, [...] "...permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries". Commenting on Australia's victory, the team's vice-captain Vic Richardson said, [...] "...we could have played any team without Bradman, but we could not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett". A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying [...] "I have always endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia." ...|$|E
500|$|Tao {{made her}} Olympic début for Singapore at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, {{arriving}} ranked 26th out of 49 butterfly swimmers. On 9 August, {{the second day}} of the swimming competition, she qualified fourth fastest for the semifinals of the 100metres butterfly after winning her heat with a personal best time of 57.77seconds. The following day she made it to the finals, shaving off 0.23seconds for another personal best time and new Asian record of 57.54seconds. She came in fourth behind her role model, Australian swimmer Lisbeth Trickett, and the USA's Christine Magnuson and Australia's Jessicah Schipper. She thus set two Asian records and the national record for the event, and became the eighth fastest butterfly swimmer in the world and first Singaporean swimmer to qualify for an Olympic Final. On 11 August, she came fifth at the 100metres butterfly finals with a time of 57.99seconds. The top three spots were taken by Trickett (56.73seconds), Magnuson (57.10seconds) and Schipper (57.25seconds). Asked by The Straits Times about her performance, Tao said, [...] "If I have given another personal best, it would not have gotten me a medal. The top three winners were just too good. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> and I pushed all the way and hoped for the best." [...] Given Tao's age compared to those of the medallists, there were hopes that she would be able to improve on [...] her performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.|$|E

After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me.

'I'm paid to shout at you', he bellowed. 'Yes', I said, 'and I'm paid to take it – [...] but not enough.' After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing. From then on we got along famously." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Melbourne, Park {{had been}} one of the youngsters sent to the [...] "special net" [...] for Armstrong's attention. Armstrong had been impressed, Park awestruck, later {{crediting}} Armstrong with [...] "most of my cricket brains". They were an odd sight in partnership, like a planet and its satellite, but their simpatico was deep. During the match against South Australia, for example, Park joined his captain with an hour left of the second day and shared a thunderous stand. Over lunch on the third day, with Park 226 and himself 101, Armstrong recalled his own eight-year-old record score for Victoria: [...] "Parky, you haven't far to go to beat my 250. I promise <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to stop there while you make them." [...] Park did not make it, but always remembered the gesture.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2014, Azalea told Kiss 108 {{backstage}} at their Jingle Ball Tour 2014 that their collaborative song would premiere in 2015, [...] "We have a song, {{which is going}} to be her first single, coming out next year." [...] Asked how the collaboration came about, Azalea added, [...] "She said she would like to work with me in an interview and they reached out. We recorded a few different things and then one of those just ended up being, I think, undeniably great. Hopefully I think everybody will get to hear it at the beginning of next year." [...] In February 2015, Azalea tweeted there were [...] "epic" [...] ongoing plans for the song. For Spears's Billboard magazine cover story, published online on March 12, 2015, it was reported that despite Spears being back in the recording studio as back as in September 2014 working on a duet with Azalea, among other tracks, a proper full-length album would not be coming soon. Spears further explained, [...] "I'm gonna do [...] slowly but surely [...] I'm gonna try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to do an amazing album, but it's not my full priority right now". Azalea confirmed the title of the track the following week. Afterwards, in Spears's cover story with People magazine, it was announced that [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] would be released on May 5.|$|E

5000|$|Alan Stafford, current {{dean of the}} Cynthia Ann Parker College of Liberal Arts at Hardin-Simmons, {{described}} Aston, accordingly:"Dr. Aston was {{a wonderful}} Christian gentleman who dearly loved HSU.

He told me once that he was excited about coming to work every single day.

2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
2500|$|As chaos {{broke out}} {{throughout}} China {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (程郁), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi, [...] "Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you." [...] He also wrote to Cheng Yu, [...] "I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, so you should do your best to serve the Administrator. You should not be thinking of rebelling." [...] Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji, [...] "Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!" [...] Cheng Ji replied, [...] "Yue Yang (樂羊) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I'll do it." [...] Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).|$|E

60|$|Now, {{one word}} {{as to the}} Committee--how could they resolve on a rough copy of an Address never sent in, unless you had been good enough to retain in memory, or on paper, the thing they have been good enough to adopt? By the by, the {{circumstances}} of the case should make the Committee less avidus gloriæ, for all praise of them would look plaguy suspicious. If necessary to be stated at all, the simple facts bear them out. They surely had a right to act as they pleased. My sole object is one which, I trust, my whole conduct has shown; viz. that I did nothing insidious--sent in no Address whatever--but, when applied <b>to,</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> for them and myself; but, above all, that there was no undue partiality, which will be what the rejected will endeavour to make out. Fortunately--most fortunately--I sent in no lines on the occasion. For I am sure that had they, in that case, been preferred, it would have been asserted that I was known, and owed the preference to private friendship. This is what we shall probably have to encounter; but, if once spoken and approved, we sha'n't be much embarrassed by their brilliant conjectures; and, as to criticism, an old author, like an old bull, grows cooler (or ought) at every baiting.|$|R
