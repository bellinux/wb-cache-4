5|$|During {{the time}} that Benchley was filming various short films, he also began working at <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> which had started in February 1925 {{under the control of}} Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting {{involved}} with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> over the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|With the {{emergence}} of <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> Benchley was able {{to stay away from}} Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing for <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker.</b>|$|E
