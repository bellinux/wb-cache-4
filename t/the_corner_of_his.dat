5|$|In September 2010, Christian tore his {{pectoral}} {{muscle and}} {{was expected to}} be sidelined for approximately six months. However, following surgery WWE released a statement that revealed he was expected to only be sidelined for four months. The injury was put into a storyline with Alberto Del Rio attacking Christian backstage, on the September 24, 2010 episode of SmackDown. Christian made his return from injury at Elimination Chamber, saving Edge from an attack by Alberto Del Rio. On the March 4 episode SmackDown, he saved Edge from another attack by Del Rio. On the March 7 episode of Raw, Christian made his in-ring return from injury against Del Rio's bodyguard, Brodus Clay, picking up the victory. On the March 11 episode of SmackDown, Christian reunited with Edge and defeated Alberto Del Rio and Brodus Clay in a tag team match. The following week, Christian defeated Del Rio in a steel cage match, but was afterwards attacked by both Del Rio and Clay. Christian was in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> best friend Edge when Edge retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Del Rio at WrestleMania XXVII.|$|E
5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or {{a part of it}} is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
25|$|During his childhood, Langmuir was {{influenced}} by his older brother, Arthur Langmuir. Arthur was a research chemist who encouraged Irving to be curious about nature and how things work. Arthur helped Irving set up his first chemistry lab in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bedroom, and he was content to answer the myriad questions that Irving would pose. Langmuir's hobbies included mountaineering, skiing, piloting his own plane, and classical music. In addition to his professional interest {{in the politics of}} atomic energy, he was concerned about wilderness conservation.|$|E

25|$|If {{you recall}} my would-be Sherlock Holmesian {{assessment}} of Professor Moriarty's – sorry , Professor Illingworth's – plan {{to recapture the}} Ashes, you will remember {{that it is in}} Sydney, in the Fourth Test, that this cricketing chess player is due to strike and then retire to <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> web and seal off reprisals. Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By this time, I fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win at any price – even at the price of Australian defeat.|$|E
25|$|Puerto Ricans became U.S. {{citizens}} {{as a result}} of the 1917 Jones-Shafroth Act and those who were eligible, with the exception of women, were expected to serve in the military, either voluntarily or {{as a result of}} the military draft (conscription). In 1948, Cancel Miranda, then eighteen and in high school, refused to be drafted into the military. One day, he was walking to school in San Juan with other students, and there was a car with four FBI agents at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house. He handed his books to the other students to take them to the place where he was living. The men arrested him and charged him with refusing the U.S. draft. The U.S. Federal Court in Puerto Rico sentenced him to two years and one day and he was sent to a prison in Tallahassee, Florida, where he remained from 1949 to 1951. During his stay in prison he confronted a prison guard because of the racist segregation inside prison walls. Under Jim Crow legislation at the time, the prison dormitories were segregated.|$|E
25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat to the desk, going {{directly}} to the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing {{he is about to}} recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E

500|$|Frank Sinatra {{stopped his}} car. The light was red. Pedestrians passed quickly across his {{windshield}} but, as usual, one did not. It {{was a girl}} in her twenties. She remained at the curb staring at him. Through <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left eye he could see her, and he knew, because it happens almost every day, that she was thinking, It looks like him, but is it? ...|$|E
500|$|Smith was {{involved}} in another incident that scared him to death. One day when he was flying his normal air mail route from Hadley Field to Cleveland, he caught something out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eye {{that looked like a}} skyscraper. He pulled back on the control stick to [...] quickly gain altitude and just missed hitting the U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles that was in his direct path. It was a close call of just over a hundred feet.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} year of {{teaching}} at Command and General Staff School, one of his students, Dwight D. Eisenhower, would come to his office, sit on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> desk, and pump him for information, knowing that Middleton had commanded a regiment in combat in France. Eisenhower asked the most practical questions, and was unquestionably motivated—he finished first in his class. [...] Nearly every officer who commanded a division in Europe during World War II attended the Command and General Staff School during Middleton's tenure there from 1924 to 1928. There was also {{a point in time}} during World War II when every corps commander in Europe had been a student of Middleton's.|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1938 Formby began work on Trouble Brewing, {{released}} the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth [...] "I'm sorry, love, but you know, I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was [...] "very sweet". His second release of 1939—shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War—was Come On George!, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. Come On George! was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{possible}} injuries and be in peak condition for the film, Willis worked out almost daily for several months prior to filming. Willis was injured on January 24, 2007 during a fight scene, when he was kicked above his right eye by a stunt double for actress Maggie Q who was wearing stiletto heels. Willis described the event as [...] "no big deal" [...] but when Len Wiseman inspected his injury, {{he noticed that the}} situation was much more serious than previously thought—in the DVD commentary, Wiseman indicates in inspecting the wound that he could see bone. Willis was hospitalized and received seven stitches which ran through his right eyebrow and down into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eye. Due to the film's non-linear production schedule, these stitches can accidentally be seen in the scene where McClane first delivers Farrell to Bowman.|$|E
500|$|McElhenny {{was also}} an asset in the {{receiving}} game, becoming a favorite target of quarterback Y. A. Tittle on screen passes. His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back I have seen in a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd think he had eyes {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he just saw the guy, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eye and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".|$|E
2500|$|The {{guard of}} the train, Mr GE Evans, {{was sitting in}} the rear carriage, looking out of the left window. [...] The force of the crash threw him into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> compartment. [...] He picked himself up after the train stopped, rushed {{to the top of the}} cutting beside the line as a vantage point to see what had happened, then {{returned}} to the carriage and applied the handbrake. [...] He deemed that the time of the accident was 9:48am, after looking at his watch displaying 9:50am and allowing two minutes since the time of impact.|$|E
2500|$|Warner Bros. was {{not happy}} with an early cut of The Outsiders and passed on distributing Rumble Fish. Despite the lack of {{financing}} in place, Coppola completely recorded the film on video during two weeks of rehearsals in a former school gymnasium and afterwards was able to show {{the cast and crew}} a rough draft of the film. To get Rourke into the mindset of his character, Coppola gave him books written by Albert Camus and a biography of Napoleon. The Motorcycle Boy's look was patterned after Camus complete with trademark cigarette dangling out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth— taken from a photograph of the author that Rourke used as a visual handle. Rourke remembers that he approached his character as [...] "an actor who no longer finds his work interesting".|$|E

2500|$|Psychologist Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire {{suggests}} that the odd sensations that people attribute to ghosts {{may be caused by}} infrasonic vibrations. Vic Tandy, experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law at Coventry University, along with Dr. Tony Lawrence of the University's psychology department, wrote in 1998 a paper called [...] "Ghosts in the Machine" [...] for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Their research suggested that an infrasonic signal of 19Hz might be responsible for some ghost sightings. Tandy was working late one night alone in a supposedly haunted laboratory at Warwick, when he felt very anxious and could detect a grey blob out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eye. When Tandy turned to face the grey blob, there was nothing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} five years the {{programme}} produced a complete 'municipalisation' of over 40,000 additional commodious working-class dwellings dotting the rural Irish countryside, the proportionally larger number of 7,560 cottages erected in County Cork in co-ordination with Sheehan and the ILLA branches became known locally as [...] "Sheehans' cottages". At first the compulsory surrender of an acre of choice land to each labourer who claimed it was resisted by the new land owning farmers. In due course they too reaped the benefits, gone the days when a farmer never knew when or where to find labour to work his fields. Either they were migrants or drink ridden. Now occupying their own proud family home and vegetable patch at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> farm, they worked cooperatively for him all year round. This had enormous long-term consequences for rural Irish society.|$|E
2500|$|On January 2, 2007, the Red Wings retired Yzerman's jersey #19 {{before a}} game against the Anaheim Ducks. As an {{additional}} honour, the captain's [...] "C" [...] was added to <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> banner to forever commemorate him as [...] "The Captain." [...] The official retirement ceremony was hosted by Yzerman's long-time friend, former NHL goaltender and ESPN hockey analyst Darren Pang, and featured such Red Wing luminaries as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Alex Delvecchio, and Scotty Bowman. For the ceremony, active Red Wings players wore Yzerman throwback jerseys representing the Red Wings, Team Canada (Canada won gold at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games), the Campbell Conference All-Star Team and the Peterborough Petes. Former teammate Vladimir Konstantinov attended the ceremony, walking across the ice for the first time without a wheelchair since his last game in the 1997 playoffs.|$|E
