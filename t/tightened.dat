30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>tightening</b> speed on the torque coefficient in lag screw timber joints with steel side plates, <b>tightening</b> tests were conducted on main timber members made from Cryptomeria japonica, Chamaecyparis obtusa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, under four <b>tightening</b> speed conditions (1, 4, 10, and 20  rpm). Major stick-slip behavior was observed in C. obtusa based {{on the relationship of}} <b>tightening</b> angle with clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 1 and 4  rpm. In addition, <b>tightening</b> speed’s effects on the torque coefficient (K) varied depending on the wood species of the main member. In P. menziesii, K was not affected by the <b>tightening</b> speed: the ratio of torque expended on <b>tightening</b> was 25 % on average, and the ratio of torque expended on bearing surface friction was higher than the ratio of torque expended on thread friction.|$|R

30|$|At <b>tightening</b> {{speeds of}} 1 and 4  rpm, major {{stick-slip}} behavior {{was observed in}} the relationships of <b>tightening</b> angle with clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque in C. obtusa.|$|R
30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} typical {{relationships}} obtained for <b>tightening</b> angle versus clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque. In C. japonica, <b>tightening</b> torque and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in <b>tightening</b> torque and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all <b>tightening</b> speeds and in C. obtusa at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 10 and 20  rpm. In all test specimens of C. obtusa at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 1 and 4  rpm, however, jagged, ‘sawtooth’ patterns are apparent in the relationships between <b>tightening</b> angle and clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque. During the experiments, the wooden members were heard to creak, suggesting these fluctuations were due to stick-slip behavior between the lag screw thread and the main member. When major stick-slip occurs, the resultant clamp force is predicted to be highly variable, even if a torque control method were applied.|$|R

40|$|A new {{measurement}} method of bolt <b>tightening</b> forces by simultaneous loading of torque and compressive force to a bolt has been developed. By simultaneous application of torque and compres- sire force to a bolt, the friction coefficients in threads and bearing surfaces are accurately detected separately {{in the process}} of <b>tightening.</b> Thus, the present method can control the <b>tightening</b> force of bolts within the error of ± 10 % for wide <b>tightening</b> forces under oil-free or lubricated conditions.

40|$|The {{technique}} of assembly by shrink fit is increasingly used today. However, {{the methodology of}} parts sizing has not changed in 50 years. Assembled parts are assumed to have accurate dimensions and very low form defects. This has the disadvantage of increasing the cost of parts production. To reduce manufacturing costs, {{the study of the}} influence of form defects on the characteristics of assembly strength is essential. Taking default form into account assumes that the <b>tightening</b> (difference between the diameters of the shaft and the bore) is defined. In the case under consideration, the <b>tightening</b> depends locally on the radius. Two definitions of the <b>tightening</b> are proposed: maximum <b>tightening</b> and mean <b>tightening.</b> It is shown that the form defect is not detrimental to the assembly strength: the mean pressures are nearly equivalent to the classical case of surfaces without defects. Various finite element simulations were performed. The influence of the value and the type of defect have been studied for conventional <b>tightening</b> (elastic materials) and more intensive <b>tightening</b> (elasto-plastic behavior) in the case of axisymmetrical and non-axisymmetrical parts.

There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading attacks against the French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July.

5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it <b>tightened</b> bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E

40|$|An {{appropriate}} flange <b>tightening</b> {{methods for}} small bore and low rating piping flange joints are clarified {{to improve the}} sealing performance of the bolted flange joints and the workability of flange <b>tightening</b> work. It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on flange bolts, while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt <b>tightening</b> tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven <b>tightening</b> balance and to perform the appropriate <b>tightening</b> work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the flanges based on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and <b>tightening</b> work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange <b>tightening</b> work...|$|R
40|$|Today, <b>tightening</b> {{tools are}} widely used in the {{industry}} and on the market you will find several products that have been assembled {{with the help of}} <b>tightening</b> tools. For example, <b>tightening</b> tools are used in the automotive industry and when assembling computer hardware. It is important that the <b>tightening</b> tools are robust and of high quality in order to fulfil the demanded requirements. High assembly speed has entailed an extensive use of <b>tightening</b> tools.

This puts high demands on the test systems since it is of importance that the <b>tightening</b> tools can be tested in a simple, fast and reliable way as well as repeatedly. Therefore, Atlas Copco would like to investigate whether a test system constructed with an electrical motor is a good choice. The idea of this thesis is to investigate possibilities and limitations in a test system consisting of an electrical motor that emulates the behaviour of a screw joint. To be able to investigate hardware limitations a test rig is constructed and then modelled in MATLAB. Further, simulations have been carried out in order to analyse the possibilities and limitations of such a test rig. The conclusion is that the implemented LQ controller seems to be able to control the braking motor sufficiently like a screw joint...|$|R
