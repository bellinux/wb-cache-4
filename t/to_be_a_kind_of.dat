5|$|Macedonistics (Македонистика) is a term, {{generally}} {{synonymous with}} disciplines such as {{study of the}} origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia. It is generally considered in Bulgaria <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pseudoscience.|$|E
25|$|Electricity was {{originally}} understood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fluid. This hydraulic analogy is still conceptually useful for understanding circuits. This analogy {{is also used}} to study the frequency response of fluid-mechanical networks using circuit tools, in which case the fluid network is termed a hydraulic circuit.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{concepts}} are ultimately based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) {{also have a}} basis. This pure basis is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pure perception, which he called a schema. But such an empiricist analogy contradicts his previous rationalist assertion that pure concepts (Categories) simply exist in the human mind without having been derived from perceptions. Therefore, they are not based on pure, schematic perceptions.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} tales of ghosts at the palace. One {{of them is}} the Grå Gubben (the Old Grey Man) who {{according}} to tradition lives in the cellar ruins of the old Tre Kronor Castle. He is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> guarding spirit for the palace and he is able to predict the future. According to other legends it is no other than Birger Jarl standing guard. He is supposed to have appeared for Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, to tell him that he would not live to see the palace completed.|$|E
25|$|More speculatively, the Higgs {{field has}} also been {{proposed}} as {{the energy of the}} vacuum, which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the Big Bang caused the universe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> featureless symmetry of undifferentiated, extremely high energy. In this kind of speculation, the single unified field of a Grand Unified Theory is identified as (or modelled upon) the Higgs field, and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the Higgs field, or some similar field, at phase transitions that the presently known forces and fields of the universe arise.|$|E
25|$|An {{influx of}} Ca2+ ions into astrocytes is the {{essential}} change that ultimately generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly caused {{by an increase in}} blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hemodynamic response function. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional syncytium. Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.|$|E

25|$|He {{spoke on}} major spiritual traditions {{including}} Jainism, Hinduism, Hassidism, Tantrism, Taoism, Christianity, Buddhism, {{on a variety}} of Eastern and Western mystics and on sacred scriptures such as the Upanishads and the Guru Granth Sahib. The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself. While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E
25|$|In October 2004, Cohen {{released}} Dear Heather, {{largely a}} musical collaboration with jazz chanteuse (and romantic partner) Anjani Thomas, although Sharon Robinson returned to collaborate on three tracks (including a duet). As light {{as the previous}} album was dark, Dear Heather reflects Cohen's own change of mood – {{he said in a}} number of interviews that his depression had lifted in recent years, which he attributed to Zen Buddhism. In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{those within}} the same {{category}} (for example the four midfielders in a 4–4–2) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with those out wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, {{this is not the}} case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4–2–1–3, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4–3–3. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4-1-2-1-2, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> 4-4-2.|$|E
30|$|In mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs), selfish {{behavior is}} observed when nodes fail {{to forward data packets}} which are actually intended. This <b>is</b> generally assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> misbehavior which might interrupt the network operations. Here, we propose a QoS-constrained EigenTrust-based non-cooperative game model for secure fault-tolerant ant look-ahead routing which attempts to identify trusted valid route and look-ahead route pairs which might help {{in choosing the}} alternate path in case of valid route failure. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed trust-based secure routing <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> accurately distinguish malicious nodes from good nodes with a limited overhead.|$|R

25|$|After the betrothal, Sarada <b>was</b> left <b>to</b> {{the care}} of her parents and Ramakrishna {{returned}} to Dakshineswar. Sarada next met Ramakrishna when she was fourteen years old, and she spent three months with him at Kamarpukur. There, Ramakrishna imparted to Sarada instructions on meditation and spiritual life. Ramakrishna's frequent bhava samadhi (ecstasy) and unorthodox ways of worship led some onlookers to doubt his mental stability, while others regarded him as a great saint. Sarada joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar in 1872 on her own accord when she was eighteen, after hearing these rumours about his mental health. She found Ramakrishna <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> and caring person.|$|R
25|$|Maaseh Merkabah (Working of the Chariot) is {{the modern}} name {{given to a}} Hekhalot text, {{discovered}} by scholar Gershom Scholem. Works of the Chariot dates from late Hellenistic period, {{after the end of}} the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly hekhal seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly hekhal that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man to draw down divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement that grew out of the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).|$|E

50|$|As the {{business}} began to develop, John asked his brother Samuel {{to join him}} and made him a partner within the firm. John also invited his uncle, Issac Horrocks, to join {{the business}} and later gave him the Turks Head Court business. As the business grew, John Horrocks' position in Preston also grew. Horrocks <b>was</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary candidate for the borough in 1796 but did not win a position until 1802. John Horrocks also built Penwortham Hall, {{which at the time}} was called Penwortham Lodge. John Horrocks built a very successful business and prospered within society.

500|$|Brian Thompson {{auditioned for}} the role of the bounty hunter in a casting session, where he was {{competing}} with another actor. Frank Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast this character, but they knew this casting would be important since he intended to be a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. After casting him, they told Thompson's agent that Thompson needed a hair cut, because at the start the Alien Bounty Hunter was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> military pilot who'd been shot down. But when the day came that Thompson came to Vancouver, there had been some [...] "misunderstanding" [...] and he hadn't been told of the [...] "crewcut", so the hairstyle seen in this episode was a [...] "compromise" [...] of sorts.|$|E
500|$|Terence Stamp as Colonel General Ludwig Beck: Singer met Stamp {{to discuss}} playing {{a part in}} X-Men, having admired him for portraying General Zod in Superman II. Stamp endured the Blitz {{as a child and}} aided Singer in staging a scene where the von Stauffenbergs hide from the Allied bombings. The actor {{described}} his approach to acting: he was not the sort of actor who puts on a mask; rather, he tries to find the place within himself that resonates with the characters he portrays saying that [...] "here has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> non-judgmental discernment, so when I'm playing villains, they don't think they're particularly villains." [...] Singer said of his direction of Stamp as the heroic and selfless Beck that he sought to find [...] "the part of Terence that would be prepared to fall on his sword for certain ideals" [...] just as Beck had in fact done after being arrested with his co-conspirators for treason.|$|E
500|$|Detailed {{geographical}} {{information about}} the Roman Empire, at least its easternmost territories, is provided in traditional Chinese historiography. The Shiji by Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) gives descriptions of countries in Central Asia and West Asia. These accounts became significantly more nuanced in the Book of Han, co-authored by Ban Gu and his sister Ban Zhao, younger siblings of the general Ban Chao, who led military exploits into Central Asia before returning to China in 102 AD. The westernmost territories of Asia {{as described in the}} Book of the Later Han compiled by Fan Ye (398–445 AD) formed the basis for almost all later accounts of Daqin. These accounts seem to be restricted to descriptions of the Levant, particularly Syria. Historical linguist Edwin G. Pulleyblank explains that Chinese historians considered Daqin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "counter-China" [...] located {{at the opposite end of}} their known world. According to Pulleyblank, [...] "the Chinese conception of Dà Qín was confused from the outset with ancient mythological notions about the far west". The Chinese histories explicitly related Daqin and Lijian (also [...] "Li-kan", or Syria) as belonging to the same country; according to Yule, D. D. Leslie, and K. H. G. Gardiner, the earliest descriptions of Lijian in the Shiji distinguished it as the Hellenistic-era Seleucid Empire. Pulleyblank provides some linguistic analysis to dispute their proposal, arguing that Tiaozhi (...) in the Shiji was most likely the Seleucid Empire and that Lijian, although still poorly understood, could be identified with either Hyrcania in Iran or even Alexandria in Egypt.|$|E

500|$|The 808 {{also saw}} {{extensive}} use beyond hip hop, such as on Whitney Houston's 1987 pop hit [...] "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)". Phil Collins found the machine useful for looping rhythms for long periods, since human drummers would {{be tempted to}} add variations and fills. Chris Norris of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "the introduction of Roland's magic box was indisputably the big bang of pop's great age of disruption, from 1983 to 1986. The 808's defiantly inorganic timbres... sketched out the domain {{of a new world}} of music." [...] The 808 was popularized in the United Kingdom by the electronic group 808 State, formed in 1984, which took its name from the machine and used it extensively. 808 State's Graham Massey said, [...] "The Roland gear began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Esperanto in music. The whole world began to be less separated through this technology, and there was a classiness to it—you could transcend your provincial music with this equipment." [...] With the rise of UK rave culture, a precursor to acid house, the 808 became a staple sound on British radio.Rapper Kanye West used it on every track on his 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak, which Slate described as an [...] "an explicit love letter to the device". Other artists who have used the 808 include Damon Albarn, Diplo, Fatboy Slim, Talking Heads, David Guetta, and New Order. It has been referenced in lyrics by artists including the Beastie Boys, Outkast, Kelis, TI, Lil Wayne, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, R Kelly, and Robbie Williams.

50|$|As Grossman {{moves into}} Part Three of the novel, he writes with an {{increasingly}} analytic style and abandons {{many of the}} characters that he has created. The only plotlines that achieve real closure are those whose protagonists perish during the war. All of these characters, he seems <b>to</b> say, <b>are</b> part of <b>a</b> larger, ongoing story — that of Russia, and of mankind. The final chapter solidifies this notion of universality. The author introduces a set of characters who remain anonymous: an elderly widow observing her tenants, a wounded army officer recently discharged from hospital, {{his wife and their}} young daughter. It is heavily implied, however, that the officer returning <b>to</b> his family <b>is</b> Major Byerozkin, <b>a</b> recurring character from Stalingrad who <b>is</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> man struggling <b>to</b> retain his humanity. In a sense, therefore, the ending is slightly uplifting - many characters have died, or experienced tragedy, but at least one fundamentally good person gets a happy ending.|$|R
