25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside the feeling of being connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow people down and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E
500|$|After {{the crash}} {{between himself and}} Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that {{although}} he saw Burti in his rear-view mirrors, {{he did not know}} which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of his gear selection problem. Burti said that the accident [...] "looked worse on TV" [...] and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: [...] "Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There's lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> show." [...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA's view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.|$|E
500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> {{little bit more of}} a direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," [...] said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; {{by the end of the}} beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E

500|$|The {{two major}} {{parts of the}} [...] "Final Fantasy XV Universe" [...] were the {{original}} net animation series [...] and the CGI feature film [...] Brotherhood was produced by Square Enix and A-1 Pictures and was released through the game's official YouTube channel and anime streaming website Crunchyroll between March and September 2016. Each episode details the backstory of Noctis from his childhood to the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes of the anime tie in with the Platinum Demo. The anime is intended <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> view into Noctis' mind that would have appeared incongruous {{within the context of}} a video game. Kingsglaive was a joined production shared between the original staff of Advent Children and multiple Western companies including Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World and the television series Game of Thrones. While similar in appearance to Advent Children, Kingsglaive had a different goal behind its development: while Advent Children was made for dedicated fans of Final Fantasy VII, Kingsglaive was made as an introduction for newcomers to the world of XV, along with conveying some of Regis' backstory. Digic Pictures later collaborated with Square Enix on [...] "Omen", a promotional trailer based on the world and story of Final Fantasy XV.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{changes to}} the event {{occurred}} in 1991. The District of Columbia's African American gay community sponsored the first [...] "Black Lesbian and Gay Pride Day" [...] on May 25, 1991. The event was created not as a competitor to the June gay pride event {{but rather as a}} way of enhancing the visibility of the African American gay and lesbian community. 1991 also saw the Gay Pride Day parade and festival move away from its traditional date for the first time. [...] Organizers shifted the event to the week prior to Father's Day <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> chance to spend the holiday with their families. 1991 was also the year that the street festival expanded to more than 200 booths, and the first year that active-duty and retired American military personnel marched in the parade. The parade made national headlines when U.S. Air Force Captain Greg Greeley, who led the active-duty group, was later questioned by military security officers and told his pending discharge was on hold because of his participation in Gay Pride day. No further action against Greeley was taken, and he eventually received an honorable discharge.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 Archer {{was bought}} by Swedish {{businessman}} Sven Salén, and registered under the ownership of Rederi Pulp AB; her homeport was Stockholm. She was renamed Anna Salén and, after initial conversion into a bulk carrier at the Bethlehem Shipyard in Baltimore, took a load of coal from the USA to Italy. By this time the owners had obtained a contract from the International Refugee Organisation to transport Displaced Persons from Europe to Australia and Canada. [...] After arrival in Italy, Anna Salén was then converted to a passenger ship, with basic accommodation being built into the cargo holds and the superstructure being extended from the foc's'le to the stern. There was accommodation for 1500 passengers in a single class. [...] After the rebuild she was [...] Her maiden voyage as a passenger ship (22 May—21 June 1949) was from Naples, Italy to Melbourne and Sydney. In December 1949, on her fourth voyage to Australia as Anna Salén she broke down in the Indian Ocean and limped into Aden, where her passengers were transferred to another ship, the Skaugum, to complete their voyage. After repairs were completed, Anna Salén resumed service. Her next two voyages, beginning on 20 June and 27 November 1950, departed from Bremerhaven bound for Australia. During the latter journey, one of the emigrants, Herr Gustav Kovaks, made a film about the voyage. It was later widely shown in Germany <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> view of how the emigration process worked. Anna Salén arrived at Fremantle on 31 December 1950 and sailed for Melbourne later that day. It was realised that she couldn't make Melbourne before the New Year, so for political reasons Anna Salén was ordered back to Fremantle where all 1,522 passengers were disembarked. She departed Bremen, West Germany on 2 July 1953 to make a round trip to Quebec, Canada The journey took seven days. In the early to mid-1950s, Anna Salén was used between Europe, Saigon and Australia. On 26 December 1951, Anna Salén came across the Canadian coaster SS Mayfall flying a distress signal. She had encountered bad weather and run out of fuel. Anna Salén towed Mayfall to St Johns and then continued her journey to Halifax On 13 August 1952, Anna Salén collided with the [...] Norwegian whaler SS Thorshovdi in the Pentland Firth. She put into Lyness with damage to her bows. She was sold in 1955 to a Greek buyer.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{creeping}} darkly {{through the}} places which this excellent person had haunted in his lifetime, {{there was a}} hidden stream of private talk, such {{as it would have}} shocked all decency to speak loudly at the street-corners. It is very singular, how the fact of a man's death often seems <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> <b>a</b> truer idea of his character, whether for good or evil, than they have ever possessed while he was living and acting among them. Death is so genuine a fact that it excludes falsehood, or betrays its emptiness; it is a touchstone that proves the gold, and dishonors the baser metal. Could the departed, whoever he may be, return in a week after his decease, he would almost invariably find himself at a higher or lower point than he had formerly occupied, on the scale of public appreciation. But the talk, or scandal, to which we now allude, had reference to matters of no less old a date than the supposed murder, thirty or forty years ago, of the late Judge Pyncheon's uncle. The medical opinion with regard to his own recent and regretted decease had almost entirely obviated the idea that a murder was committed in the former case. Yet, as the record showed, there were circumstances irrefragably indicating that some person had gained access to old Jaffrey Pyncheon's private apartments, at or near the moment of his death. His desk and private drawers, in a room contiguous to his bedchamber, had been ransacked; money and valuable articles were missing; there was a bloody hand-print on the old man's linen; and, by a powerfully welded chain of deductive evidence, the guilt of the robbery and apparent murder had been fixed on Clifford, then residing with his uncle in the House of the Seven Gables.|$|E
