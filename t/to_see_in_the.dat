5|$|Del Toro {{spent a year}} {{working with}} Beacham on the screenplay, and is {{credited}} as co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genre, such as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack seen from a child's perspective. The script also received an uncredited rewrite from Neil Cross, who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series Luther and wrote the del Toro-produced horror film Mama. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script Monstropolis caught the filmmaker's attention. Drew Pearce also carried out uncredited work on the script.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.|$|E
5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E

5|$|There {{are still}} intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But {{it is more}} than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of the man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the {{restoration}} claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength {{is more important than}} speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}}, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark unless they {{suffer from a}} deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology {{and the use of}} red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{drawback}} to rocket flights is their very short duration (just {{a few minutes}} above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to Earth) and their limited field of view.

50|$|Diagnostic {{technology}} is another area for continued research. MRI has enabled scientists <b>to</b> <b>see</b> conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spine, including syringomyelia before symptoms appear. A new technology, known as dynamic MRI, allows investigators to view spinal fluid flow within the syrinx. CT scans allow physicians <b>to</b> <b>see</b> abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain, and other diagnostic tests have also improved greatly with {{the availability of}} new, non-toxic, contrast dyes.|$|R
25|$|Pit vipers, pythons {{and some}} boas have organs {{that allow them}} to detect {{infrared}} light, such that these snakes are able to sense the body heat of their prey. The common vampire bat may also have an infrared sensor on its nose. It has been found that birds and some other animals are tetrachromats and have the ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet down to 300 nanometers. Bees and dragonflies are also able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet. Mantis shrimps can perceive both polarized light and multispectral images and have twelve distinct kinds of color receptors, unlike humans which have three kinds and most mammals which have two kinds.|$|E
25|$|The game's plot {{involves}} the player saving the galaxy by manufacturing droids that can complete secret missions based on certain specifications {{such as the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark or to jump. These missions are where the educational properties come into play, as the missions puzzle specifies, it will teach the player about energy, force and motion, simple machines, light, and magnetism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{listeners}} perceive {{speech as}} {{a stream of}} discrete units (phonemes, syllables, and words), this linearity is difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> physical speech signal (see Figure 2 for an example). Speech sounds do not strictly follow one another, rather, they overlap. A speech sound {{is influenced by the}} ones that precede and the ones that follow. This influence can even be exerted at a distance of two or more segments (and across syllable- and word-boundaries).|$|E

25|$|When {{configured}} as {{a basketball}} arena, {{the fans in}} the nearby bleachers got a suitable view of the court, but the action was difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper decks. Concessions were very {{far away from the}} temporary infrastructure. The Metrodome as a basketball arena was much larger than most NBA and major college basketball arenas, which run to about 20,000 seats; it functioned like Syracuse's large Carrier Dome. However, the NCAA made a significant amount of money selling the high number of seats for regional and championship games for the men's basketball tournament.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a general}} {{consensus}} about values and ideologies underlying the monumental complex of Mont'e Prama, political implications and artistic influences are still hotly debated. As for political significance, some scholars tend <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{small number of}} warriors, with respect to archers, a sign of military and political decay of the Nuragic society, caused by the establishment of Phoenician centers in Sardinia. This would be mirrored by the import and adoption of Levantine ideological models and by assignment of the statues to the orientalizing period spreading throughout the Mediterranean area during the 8th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Storytelling {{is a way}} {{to teach}} younger members of {{indigenous}} communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, Navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life. In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.|$|E

He nearly won the fall Martinsville but a flat tire with 15 laps to go gave Denny Hamlin the win. A couple weeks later he and Jeff Gordon got into a wreck long after the caution was out. Burton walked up the track to confront Gordon and the two got into a shoving match. Burton finished 12th in the final standings. Afterwards, Burton assumed responsibility for the incident, stating he was attempting {{to catch up to}} Gordon, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight's glare.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} video {{released}} on 6 October 2012, Gular Ahmadova is heard talking about various high-ranking government officials compiling lists of MP candidates {{which they would}} like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly following the election. Among them, she mentions Minister of Economic Development Farhad Aliyev, Minister of Health Ali Insanov (both arrested {{on the eve of}} the 2005 election for planning a coup d'état and sentenced to imprisonment), Minister of Emergency Situations Kamaladdin Heydarov, head of the Presidential Administration Ramiz Mehdiyev, President Ilham Aliyev, and First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva. Sevinj Babayeva confirms this in the video, which together with the first video appears to be a fragment of a single conversation.|$|E
25|$|Hull House enabled Addams {{to befriend}} {{and become a}} {{colleague}} to early members of the Chicago School of Sociology. Her influence, through her work in applied sociology, impacted the thought {{and direction of the}} Chicago School of Sociology's members. In 1893, she co-authored the compilation of essays written by Hull House residents and workers titled, Hull-House Maps and Papers. These ideas helped shape and define the interests and methodologies of the Chicago School. She worked with American philosopher, George H. Mead, on social reform issues, including promoting women's rights, ending child labor, and mediating during the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. This strike in particular bent thoughts of protests because it dealt with women workers, ethnicity, and working conditions. All of these subjects were key items that Addams wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> society.|$|E
