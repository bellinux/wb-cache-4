5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E

5|$|The Peasant Popular Union and Social Democrats {{formed a}} left-wing {{coalition}} {{in opposition to}} <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats.</b> But the coalition still did not constitute a majority, and it went on to add representatives of minorities in Lithuania – Germans from the Klaipėda Region, Poles, and Jews.

5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E

50|$|The Centrist <b>Democrat</b> International is <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> {{political}} international.

It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> World Union, building on the legacy of other <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for <b>the</b> first time <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> International. <b>The</b> name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to <b>the</b> promotion of <b>Christian</b> democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI {{is closer to the}} political centre and more communitarian than the IDU.|$|R

5|$|There is {{considerable}} academic debate concerning {{the involvement of}} Antanas Smetona in planning the coup. In 1931, Augustinas Voldemaras, who had since been ousted {{from the government and}} forced into exile, wrote that Smetona had been planning the coup since 1925. Historian Zenonas Butkus asserted that an idea of a coup had been raised as early as 1923. However, this time frame is disputed, since the military did not take action until the autumn of 1926. Smetona's personal secretary, Aleksandras Merkelis, held that Smetona knew about the coup, but neither inspired nor organized it. Before the coup, Smetona had been the editor of Lietuvis (The Lithuanian), and a shift in its orientation that took place in late November has been cited as evidence that he was not informed about the coup until then. Before the issue of 25 November appeared, the newspaper was critical of the government and of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats.</b> On that date, however, the newspaper published several articles about 21 November student protest and an article headlined Bolshevism's Threat to Lithuania. The latter article argued that the communists posed a genuine threat and that the current government was incapable of dealing with it. After that date, the newspaper ceased issuing criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In the course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E
5|$|The ruling Swedish Social Democratic Party have {{remained}} in favour of neutrality and non-alignment. This preference is shared by their partners, the Green Party, {{as well as the}} Left Party. The centre-right Moderate Party and the Liberal Party are the largest parties by current parliamentary representation in favor of NATO membership. The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea is credited with renewed public calls for NATO membership from notable politicians. The Centre Party was opposed to NATO membership until September 2015, when party leadership under Annie Lööf announced that they would motion to change the party policy in order to push for Sweden to join NATO at their next party conference. <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats,</b> also previously opposed, likewise voted to support NATO membership at their party meeting on 9 October 2015.|$|E

5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E
25|$|These parties co-operated in {{coalition}} cabinets {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats</b> {{had always been}} a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats</b> and social democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian democrats and liberals.
