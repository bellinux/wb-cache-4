In June 1951, she finally secured the return of Alexis by agreeing to cancel her receivership action and divorce suit in California in return for a divorce [...] "guaranteed by L. Ron Hubbard". She met him in Wichita to resolve the situation. He told her that she was [...] "in a state of complete madness" [...] due to being dictated to and hypnotized by Hollister and his [...] "communist cell". Playing along, she told Hubbard that he was right and that the only way she could break free of their power was by going through with the divorce. He replied, [...] "You know, I'm a public figure and you're nobody, so if {{you have to go through}} the divorce, I'll accuse you of desertion so it won't look so bad on my public record." [...] She agreed to sign a statement, written by Hubbard himself, that retracted the allegations that she had made against him: I, Sara Northrup Hubbard, do hereby state that the things I have said about L. Ron Hubbard in courts and the public prints have been grossly exaggerated or entirely false.I have not at any time believed otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard is a fine and brilliant man.I make this statement of my own free will for I have begun to realize that what I have done may have injured the science of Dianetics, which in my studied opinion may be the only hope of sanity in future generations.I was under enormous stress and my advisers insisted it was necessary for me <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>through</b> an <b>action</b> as I have done.There is no other reason for this statement than my own wish to make atonement for the damage I may have done. In the future I wish to lead a quiet and orderly existence with my little girl far away from the enturbulating influences which have ruined my marriage.Sara Northrup Hubbard.|$|R
40|$|O estado de Goiás deu início ao seu processo de regionalização das ações de saúde, seguindo as diretrizes do SUS e as normas preconizadas pela NOAS 2001. O Plano Diretor Regionalização (PDR) está pactuado desde 2002, entretanto ainda não se encontra em pleno funcionamento. As ações de assistência farmacêutica (AF) ainda não foram regionalizadas. Com a intenção que identificar quais ações deveriam ser regionalizadas, as maiores dificuldades para a regionalização desse setor e a necessidade de se regionalizar essas ações, questionou-se os servidores da Secretaria de Estado da Saúde SES-GO, do nível central e regional, que trabalham direta ou indiretamente com ações de AF. Utilizando a escala de Likert para medir a intenção (vontade, desejo) das atitudes desses servidores. Demonstrou–se, nesta pesquisa, a predisposição de realizar regionalmente as ações de programação anual, distribuição de medicamentos aos municípios e avaliação das ações básicas dos municípios da sua região, a neutralidade quanto a regionalização das ações de seleção de medicamentos e a dispensação de medicamentos especiais. Apenas com relação à ação de aquisição regionalizada se encontrou uma predisposição desfavorável, ainda que com a predisposição de concordar com a necessidade da regionalização da assistência farmacêutica estadual. As maiores dificuldades são a carência de recursos humanos, agenda política, programação anual e a estrutura física deficitária das administrações regionais de saúde. The {{state of}} Goiás started {{the process of}} {{regionalization}} of the Health Action, following the lines of direction of the SUS and the norms praised for NOAS 2001. The managing plan to decentralize the regions the execution of action (PDR) agreed to this since 2002. However, this still does not meet in full functioning. The actions of pharmaceutical assistance are still not executed by the health regions. With the intent of identifying which actions would have <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> <b>through</b> by the regions, which is the biggest difficulty <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>through</b> with the <b>action</b> of AF in the regions, {{and the necessity of}} it decentralized for the regions and of the execution of these actions, the servers of the State secretary of Health, of central and regional level, question that they work directly or indirectly with action of AF. Using the scale of Likert to measure the intention (want and desire) of the attitudes of these servers, it demonstrated, in this research, the predisposition of <b>carrying</b> <b>through</b> the <b>actions</b> of annually programming regionally, medicine distribution in the cities and evaluation of the basic actions of the cities of its region, the actions of medicine election and the dispensing of special medicines keep the neutrality how much the execution in the regions. But the action of acquisition executed in the regions has not favored predisposition. It has the predisposition to agree to the necessity to execute action of the pharmaceutical assistance in the region. The biggest difficulties are the lack of human resources, agenda politics, annual programming and the deficit physical structure of the regional administrations of health...|$|R
40|$|Methodological {{approach}} view on collecting science archives: the « metaprotocole » as {{new point}} of view". Over {{the last two}} decades, archivists who are dealing with scientific archives have had {{to face up to}} rather radical changes of their surroundings: the archival world and the laboratories. The highlighted difficulties are generally attributed to the modification of scientific know-how process on the one hand, and to alterations to the preservation and diffusion methods of this know-how on the other hand. These technical changes are often assimilated to the generalisation of computer techniques and the resulting development of electronic communication. For some time, the primary question connected to those modifications seemed to be the one about the preservation of the data of those “new archives”, and the support on which it is stored. However, the managers of the information and the archivists have worked out technical solutions in order to resolve the preservation of electronic documents. Several problems are outstanding, as there are :the matter of the authenticity of the documents, the technical problems related to the objects of the laboratories, the databases, and so on. Yet, the main difficulty is situated elsewhere … Many historians, sociologists and philosophers of science have proved it necessary to penetrate into the interior of the laboratory in order to comprehend the activity :the scientific know-how is not a “neutral” one, it is subject to its fabrication process. Gradually, the archivists have adopted this way of proceeding. It seems clear to us that the major problem consists in understanding how today’s science functions. The question “how can we study the scientific phenomenon if we are not even able to put together the documentary tracks it produces ?” can be inverted to a different question :”how can we assemble the tracks of an activity of which we do not understand the elaboration process ?”. An overall understanding of the scientific activity and its institutional and social aspects is to be developed. If we fail <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>through</b> this double <b>action,</b> we will end up with archival units of which we will have lost the context of the production. The units will thus have lost all meaning and will have become virtually useless. The management and use of today’s and tomorrow’s scientific archives mostly depend on whether or not {{we will be able to}} familiarise ourselves with those interdisciplinary actions, adapt them to the classical treatment of archives and integrate them in the continuum record process. In this point of view, a close link will appear between archivals methods applied in the Australian Science Archives Project and lessons coming from modern philosophy and history of contemporary sciences[URL]...|$|R
