[...] According to the police, Brown, allegedly upset that collectible coins he had purchased a few weeks before were worthless, returned to <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> representing himself as a police officer, handcuffed her, and drove the girl to Kanawha County under the pretense of taking her in for questioning. The girl escaped from Brown's car a few hours later after realizing he was not an officer, according to West Virginia State Police. After the arrest, the USMC demoted Brown to Captain and involuntarily retired him at that rank on February 1, 2006. On August 14, 2009 Brown entered a Kennedy plea, meaning he did not admit guilt but did not contest that prosecutors had evidence to prove his guilt, and was convicted on a felony charge of attempting to commit kidnapping and a misdemeanor petty larceny charge in Cabell County, West Virginia Circuit Court. [...] Brown was sentenced to three years probation, two years of which were to be spent in home confinement, and agreed to pay restitution and all court costs.|$|E

Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero with Andre Malraux in June 1907, about which he later said [...] "When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. <b>The</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market,</b> the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening to me, right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things." [...] Maurice de Vlaminck is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of Fang extraction in 1904.|$|E
