5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning {{is determined by the}} things that they are about in the external world. This makes it difficult to explain how they can play <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.|$|E
5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this note is to establish, in a {{categorical}} manner, the universality of <b>the</b> Geroch-Kronheimer-Penrose <b>causal</b> boundary when considering <b>the</b> types of <b>causal</b> structures that may profitably be put on any sort of boundary for a spacetime. Actually, this can only be done for <b>the</b> future <b>causal</b> boundary (or <b>the</b> past <b>causal</b> boundary) separately; furthermore, only the chronology relation, not the causality relation, is considered, and the GKP topology is eschewed. The final result {{is that there is}} a unique map, with <b>the</b> proper <b>causal</b> properties, from <b>the</b> future <b>causal</b> boundary of a spacetime onto any “reasonable ” boundary which supports some sort of chronological structure and which purports to consist of a future completion of the spacetime.

5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> variant.|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, Putnam {{is known for}} his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. In {{philosophy of}} language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called Twin Earth.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
50|$|The {{validity}} of <b>the</b> physical <b>causal</b> closure {{has long been}} debated. In modern times, it has been pointed out that science is based on removing the subject from investigations, and by seeking objectivity. This outsider status for the observer, a third-person perspective, is said by some philosophers to have automatically severed science from the ability to examine subjective issues like consciousness and free will. A different attack upon <b>the</b> physical <b>causal</b> closure discussed by Hodgson is to claim science itself does not support <b>the</b> physical <b>causal</b> closure. Some philosophers have criticized the argument for <b>the</b> physical <b>causal</b> closure by supporting teleology and mental-to-physical causation via a soul.|$|R

5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. <b>The</b> <b>causal</b> relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E

40|$|People who {{are high}} in causal {{uncertainty}} doubt their own ability to understand the causes of social events. In three studies, we {{examined the effects of}} target and perceiver causal uncertainty on attitudes toward <b>the</b> target. Target <b>causal</b> uncertainty was manipulated via responses on a causal uncertainty scale in Studies 1 and 2, and with a scenario in Study 3. In Studies 1 and 2, we found that participants liked <b>the</b> low <b>causal</b> uncertainty target more than <b>the</b> high <b>causal</b> uncertainty target. This preference was stronger for low relative to high causal uncertainty participants because high causal uncertainty participants held more uncertain ideals. In Study 3, we examined the value individuals place upon causal understanding (causal importance) as an additional moderator. We found that regardless of their own causal uncertainty level, participants who were high in <b>causal</b> importance liked <b>the</b> low <b>causal</b> uncertainty target more than <b>the</b> high <b>causal</b> uncertainty target. However, when participants were low in causal importance, low causal uncertainty perceivers showed no preference and high causal uncertainty perceivers preferred <b>the</b> high <b>causal</b> uncertainty target.
