5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over <b>the</b> <b>mixture.</b> Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} issue of underdetermined source {{separation}} in a particular informed configuration where both the sources and <b>the</b> <b>mixtures</b> are known during a so-called encoding stage. This knowledge enables the computation of a side-information which is small enough to be inaudibly embedded into <b>the</b> <b>mixtures.</b> At <b>the</b> decoding stage, the sources are no longer assumed to be known, only <b>the</b> <b>mixtures</b> and <b>the</b> extracted side-information are processed for source separation. The proposed system models the sources as independent and locally stationary Gaussian processes (GP) and the mixing process as a linear filtering. This model allows reliable estimation of the sources through generalized Wiener filtering, provided their spectrograms are known. As these spectrograms are too large to be embedded in <b>the</b> <b>mixtures,</b> we show how they can be efficiently approximated using either Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) or image compression.

Also, it was recognized that this relationship was not influenced by the kinds of lipids. Consequently, in the case of the known lecithin concentration, the protein contents in <b>the</b> <b>mixtures</b> of lipids and myosin B might be determined from the differences in the absorbances of <b>the</b> <b>mixtures</b> and lecithin at 278 nm.

5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. <b>The</b> <b>mixture</b> is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
