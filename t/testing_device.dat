25|$|The flawed {{primary mirror}} of the Hubble Space Telescope was ground and {{polished}} in Danbury by Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit from 1979 to 1981. It was mistakenly ground to the wrong shape due {{to the use of}} a miscalibrated <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> The mistake was not discovered until after the telescope was in orbit and began to be used. The effects of the flaw were corrected during the telescope's first servicing mission in 1993.|$|E
500|$|A {{commission}} {{headed by}} Lew Allen, {{director of the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was established {{to determine how the}} error could have arisen. The Allen Commission found that the main null corrector, a <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled—one lens was out of position by 1.3mm. [...] During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, Perkin-Elmer analyzed its surface with two conventional null correctors. [...] However, for the final manufacturing step (figuring), they switched to a custom-built null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of the device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. [...] There was one later opportunity to catch the error, since for technical reasons a few of the final tests needed to use the two conventional null correctors. [...] These tests correctly reported spherical aberration, but were dismissed since the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.|$|E

Within hours, Mattis forwarded his email exchange with Holmes to military officials, asking [...] "how do we overcome this new obstacle." [...] In a July 2013 letter from the Department of Defense approving his possible employment by Theranos, Mattis was given permission with conditions. He was cautioned to do so only if he did not represent Theranos with regard to the blood <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> and its potential acquisition by the Departments of the Navy or Defense.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the theoretic {{deduction}} and corresponding reasonable assumption, a mathematic model was built according to the flight model of exterior trajectory to improve the angular tracing precision of rotating mirror house in a streak camera. A <b>test</b> <b>device</b> was designed and developed for the angular tracing precision of rotating mirror house in the streak camera. The measuring principle of the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> was introduced, the angular tracing precision was measured by the developed device and the uncertainty factors of the <b>tested</b> <b>device</b> were analyzed. The tested results show that the angular tracing precision of the high speed rotating mirror in the streak camera is (0. 34 ± 0. 06) °, the relative uncertainty of the <b>tested</b> <b>device</b> is 3. 0 ″ and the main error sources come from interpretation and servo control. It concludes that the <b>tested</b> <b>device</b> designed has higher precision and reliability. © 2015, Science Press. All right reserved...|$|R

2500|$|Skin-prick {{testing is}} easy to do and results are {{available}} in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a [...] "bifurcated needle", {{which looks like a}} fork with two prongs. Others use a [...] "multitest", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a <b>testing</b> <b>device,</b> and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not, because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient's history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark 14 torpedo {{tended to}} run some [...] too deep for several reasons. The first {{was that it}} was tested with an {{exercise}} warhead that was more buoyant than the warhead; that was a precaution made to avoid losing an expensive torpedo. A light exercise head made the torpedo positively buoyant, so it would float to the surface {{at the end of its}} run. The live warhead contained more mass, so it reached equilibrium at a lower depth. Also, the depth mechanism was designed prior to the warhead's explosive charge being increased, making the torpedo even heavier overall. [...] "Testing conditions became more and more unrealistic, obscuring the effect of the heavier warhead on depth performance." [...] Furthermore, the depth <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> used by NTS to verify the torpedo's running depth (the depth and roll recorder) had the same measuring port placement error as the Mark 14's depth control port, so both were off by the same amount in the same direction and gave the impression that the torpedo was running at the desired depth when it was actually much deeper. After hearing of the deep-running torpedo problem, most submarine skippers simply set their torpedoes' running depth to zero, which risked broaching the torpedo.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} efficacy of commercially available rapid diagnostic <b>test</b> <b>devices</b> for Dengue serology. To {{find out the}} sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic devices with Elisa results as the Gold standard. Methods: During the dengue virus epidemic in Lahore a pilot {{study was conducted in}} order to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of two most frequently used immunochromatographic rapid <b>test</b> <b>devices</b> in public sector hospitals. The results of both the kits were compared to each other. Sensitivity and specificity was calculated against results of ELISA as the reference gold standard. Results: Results of kit-A revealed a very high false negative rate when compared to ELISA where actual prevalence rate shown by ELISA was 96. 0 % compared to prevalence rate of 44. 0 % with rapid diagnostic <b>test</b> <b>device</b> kit-A. Similarly the results of rapid <b>test</b> <b>device</b> Kit-B showed high false negative results for dengue virus prevalence. Actual prevalence rate of dengue fever shown by ELISA was 96. 0 % where as {{it turned out to be}} 50 % with the kit-B rapid <b>test</b> <b>device.</b> Comparison of Results of two kits revealed no significant difference of test positivity rates. Conclusion: Rapid <b>test</b> <b>devices</b> based on immunochromatographic method supplied in the public sector hospitals are not reliable diagnostic tools for screening for dengue virus infection Health authorities need to review their strategy for supply of more reliable tools during epidemics in order to avoid false negative results...|$|R
40|$|Automotive {{infotainment}} {{systems are}} automotive equipment manufactured with narrow tolerances. Besides the hardware itself, the components that {{interact with the}} user and {{with the rest of}} the car have to fulfil strict requirements. These components are the buttons face plate and the pins connector. The buttons must fulfil haptics requirements of force and stroke in order that the feeling of pressing them would be the same as the rest car buttons’ feeling. The pins connector must fulfil force requirements in order that ergonomic and resistance characteristics would be achieved. These characteristics must be measured to verify whether the prototypes are within required tolerances in order to produce the infotainment system model. Developing a <b>test</b> <b>device</b> to check the force and stroke characteristics of infotainment systems is the aim of this project. Having its own forcestroke <b>test</b> <b>device</b> in the Panasonic headquarter in Langen would speed up the process of verification and modification of the infotainment systems prototypes and would simplify the design task. To develop the suitable <b>test</b> <b>device</b> required, the characteristics of both kind of test have been taken into account. The button test and the pins connector tests have very different requirements. On one hand, the button test requires high resolution, accuracy and repeatability and its range of force is from 0 N to 10 N. On the other hand, the pins connector tests require applying higher force, from - 125 N to 450 N, being negative for pulling and positive for pushing. Moreover, these kinds of tests do not require sensors resolution and accuracy as high as those for the button test. Taking into account these requirements, a stable and stiff <b>test</b> <b>device</b> with an actuator, two force sensors and a displacement sensor has been developed. The simplicity of the device was a necessity due to the stability and the low cost required. Apart from the design and development of the <b>test</b> <b>device,</b> the application interface has also programmed, using LabVIEW software. The software for controlling and getting the result of the button test has already been developed and is totally functional. However, the software of the pins connector tests will be the next tasks to achieve. Although the repeatability of the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> is acceptable, its accuracy must be tested by a certification company, in order to validate the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> performance. To sum up, this <b>test</b> <b>device</b> has been a good inversion. Panasonic has got a low cost <b>test</b> <b>device</b> with which the company will save money, the infotainment systems will not be tested by an external company, and time, the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> will speed up the verification and modification process of prototypes...|$|R

40|$|Presented in this Master’s {{project is}} a {{microfluidic}} valve design, a fabrication technology, and results from <b>test</b> <b>devices.</b> The microvalve will be a component in a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell developed by Carnegie Mellon University. The designed microfluidic valve consists of two electrostatically actuated membranes hydraulically coupled together. The substrate below the membranes has a curved profile to re, duce the pull-in voltage- a phenomenon known as "zipper actuation". Three microvalves can be actuated pefistaltically in series to create a pump. The membranes require no steady-state power and use no rectifying valves. Test devices are fabricated as proof-of-concept experiments for the microvalves. The <b>test</b> <b>devices</b> have a single mesh-membrane suspended over a flat-bottomed cavity in the silicon.
