5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller <b>Titan</b> to fight them. On defeating the larger <b>Titan,</b> he can dismount the <b>Titan</b> he previously jacked and directly jack the larger <b>Titan.</b> The dismounted <b>Titan</b> will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The MOL {{program was}} {{cancelled}} on 10 June 1969, {{in favour of}} unmanned reconnaissance satellites. Some systems developed for the program were later used on unmanned missions, while the space suits which were under development were transferred to NASA. The <b>Titan</b> IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other <b>Titan</b> rockets — the stretched first and second stages became the <b>Titan</b> 34, which {{was used as the}} core of some later <b>Titan</b> IIIB flights, and on the <b>Titan</b> 34D. The seven-segment solid rocket boosters were later introduced on the <b>Titan</b> IVA.|$|E

5|$|Because {{observations}} of <b>Titan</b> were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum <b>Titan</b> flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission.

5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} <b>Titan,</b> and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, <b>Titan</b> is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed <b>Titan</b> less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on <b>Titan</b> and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere. Using <b>Titan</b> as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Titans</b> {{went into}} the playoffs as a long shot as they were facing off against the league leading Edmonton Warriors. The <b>Titans</b> however came to life and forced the Warriors to a 12-12 tie in Game One.

The call was granted and Kyle was ejected from the game. The <b>Titans</b> then had to rally behind defenseman Brendan Sanche, who had to go in net as the <b>Titans</b> backup Austin Souliere was not able to attend the game. The <b>Titans</b> were decimated as they were down to three men as the Warriors had a powerplay before the call. The Warriors quickly made it a 5-1 game. Austin Souliere however did end up making it but was not able to stop the Warriors scoring. The game ended with a score of 7-2 and thus ending the <b>Titans</b> season.|$|R
