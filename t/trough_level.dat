40|$|AIM: Fixed dose oral {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitors imatinib, sunitinib and pazopanib show a high interpatient variability in plasma exposure. A relationship between plasma exposure and treatment outcome has been established, which supports {{the rationale for}} dose optimization of these drugs. The {{aim of this study}} was to monitor how many patients reached adequate <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> after therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimization in daily practice. METHODS: A cohort study was performed in patients treated with imatinib, sunitinib or pazopanib of whom follow-up drug levels were measured between August 2012 and April 2016. Patients' characteristics were collected by reviewing electronic patient records. Drug levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> were estimated using a predefined algorithm. Dose interventions were proposed based on <b>trough</b> <b>levels.</b> RESULTS: In total, 396 <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> were determined in 109 patients. Median sample frequency per patient was 3. During the first measurement only 38 % of patients showed <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> within the predefined target ranges despite standard dosing; 52 % of the patients showed drug levels below and 10 % above the target range. In 35 out of 41 patients (85 %) dose interventions led to adequate <b>trough</b> <b>levels.</b> Eventually, 64 % of the total cohort reached adequate <b>trough</b> <b>levels.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Dose optimization proved an effective tool to reach adequate <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in patients treated with imatinib, sunitinib and pazopanib. The percentage of patients with adequate <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> increased from 38 to 64 %. Therapeutic drug monitoring may add to the improvement of efficacy and reduction of toxicity and costs of these treatments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aminoglycosides are {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} severe gram-negative infections. Their use is associated with substantial risk of toxicity and hence need to monitor therapeutic drug levels. The prevalence of abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in hospitalized children in our local setting has not been determined thus putting into question the cost benefits of providing therapeutic drug monitoring services in our resource poor settings. Objective: To determine the prevalence of abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in children below the age of 12 years with clinically suspected gram negative infections at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The secondary objective was to determine if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation using Schwartz formula correlates with drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in children on aminoglycoside therapy. Methods: Children aged 1 day up to 12 years started on aminoglycoside therapy with either gentamicin or amikacin were identified in this hospital based cross-sectional survey that was undertaken at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi over a period of six months. Aminoglycoside drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> and serum creatinine measurements were done in 81 patients at 24 hours after initiation of aminoglycoside therapy. GFR was calculated using Schwartz formula for all the serum creatinine values obtained. Data analysis: Data accrued were analysed using Stata Data Analysis and Statistical software. The prevalence of abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> was calculated. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> and estimated GFR. The prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, positive and vi negative predictive values as well as likelihood ratios, and hence accuracy of estimated GFR in predicting for abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> was also calculated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was also determined. Results: A total of eighty one participants were recruited into this study with a median age of three days, 48. 2 % of whom were males and 51. 8 % female. The prevalence of abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in children below the age of 12 years with clinically suspected gram negative infections admitted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi was 4. 9 % (95 % CI 1. 4 % to 12. 2 %). There were no reported adverse outcomes in any of the children with abnormal drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> upon follow-up. The strength of the association between aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> and glomerular filtration rate was found to be weak with Pearson correlation co-efficient of - 0. 342. The sensitivity and specificity of estimated GFR in predicting for abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> was 25. 0 % and 98. 7 % respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of estimated GFR in predicting for abnormal aminoglycoside <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> were 50. 0 % and 96. 2 %. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 19. 3 and 0. 76. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0. 6185. Conclusion: The prevalence of abnormal drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in children on aminoglycoside treatment in this study is low and therefore the routine screening of patients on aminoglycoside therapy for toxicity using drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> may not be justified. This is further supported by the lack of adverse clinical outcomes in the children found with toxic drug <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> in this study...|$|R

Prevalence of low (5 [*]mg/l) infliximab serum <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> and anti-infliximab antibodies was recorded. Relationship {{of a change in}} anti-infliximab antibodies and treatment interval was described. Reliability of consecutive infliximab serum <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> and anti-infliximab antibodies in patients with stable DAS 28 and treatment was analysed with Spearman correlation and kappa-analysis. Results 147 patients with a mean disease duration of 11 [*]years (sd 7) and DAS 28 of 3. 5 (sd 1. 3) at baseline were followed during 1. 5 [*]years. Inter-individual variability in infliximab levels in patients with low DAS 28 was high (median 1. 4 [*]mg/L, IQR 3. 35), with 31 % (95 %CI: 20 - 42 %) having low (5 [*]mg/L). Interestingly also in RA patients with DAS 28 [*]≤[*] 3. 2, anti-infliximab antibodies were found in one-third of the patients, with half of them having antibodies every visit during a median of more than one year. Agreement for consecutive measurements of serum <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> and anti-infliximab antibodies was high in stable patients: r[*]=[*] 0. 97 (p[*]=[*] 0. 00001) and kappa[*]=[*] 1. 0 (SE 0. 14) Anti-infliximab antibody appearance was influenced by interval increases (relative risk (RR) 5. 2, 2. 6 - 10. 7), but patients still showed low infliximab levels.

5000|$|In {{medicine}} and pharmacology, a <b>trough</b> <b>level</b> or trough concentration {{is the lowest}} concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered, often used in therapeutic drug monitoring. The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time, the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region, before a new dose sends it higher again. The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum, although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant. It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour, the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body, so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping. In a medicine that is administered periodically, the <b>trough</b> <b>level</b> should be measured just before {{the administration of the}} next dose in order to avoid overdosing. A <b>trough</b> <b>level</b> is contrasted with a [...] "peak level", which is the highest level of the medicine in the body, and the [...] "average level", which is the mean level over time.

RESULTS: Using the American Diabetes Association criteria, 15 % developed IFG and 32 % developed DM in the first year after transplantation. High <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> of FK- 506 during the first month after transplantation (especially > 15 ng/ml) and high body mass index (BMI) were significant risk factors for IFG or DM. Patients with (steroid-treated) acute rejections in addition to high <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> of FK- 506 were most prone to develop DM, whereas high BMI conferred risk of developing IFG. Patients with posttransplantation glycemic abnormalities also had higher levels of serum triglycerides at the time of transplantation, but they needed a lower dose of FK- 506 to obtain higher <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> of FK- 506, suggesting metabolic differences already present before transplantation.

Vancomycin is a key {{antibiotic}} {{for the treatment of}} Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. Vancomycin has a narrow therapeutic range. Overdosing imposes a risk of nephro- and ototoxicity, wherease underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15 – 20 lg/mL have been identified as the optimal target trough levels. Methods. A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis. Results. The model identified 3 simple parameters that were responsible for 94. 6 % of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin <b>trough</b> <b>level,</b> dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77. 9 % of patients, whereas major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean measured <b>trough</b> <b>level</b> of 16. 5 lg/mL was 5. 6 % lower than the mean predicted <b>trough</b> <b>level</b> of 17. 5 lg/mL. With regard to loading doses, a fixed loading dose of 20 mg/kg led to subtherapeutic trough levels in one-half of patients. Conclusions. The VDC permits accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis <b>trough</b> <b>level,</b> dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session in the majority of patients undergoing hemodialysis.

40|$|Background: Vancomycin is used {{primarily}} for Gram-positive infections. Recommended dosage regimens and targeted therapeutic levels vary between institutions. Objectives: This study aims to describe therapeutic levels according to initial vancomycin doses and patient’s age. A secondary {{objective was to}} evaluate appropriateness of vancomycin use in our hospital. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Patients {{included in this study}} were classified by age (neonates, infants, children and adolescents) and categorized into those who received vancomycin ≤ 5 and > 5 days. Initial vancomycin dosing regimens and corresponding initial <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> obtained were evaluated. Initial <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> drawn in relation to the third, fourth, or fifth doses corresponding to the first course of therapy were analyzed. Acceptable <b>trough</b> <b>levels</b> ranged from 5 - 20 mg/L. Results: One-hundred-and-sixty-four patients who received intravenous vancomycin in 2013 were included. Of the 229 courses of vancomycin, 190 (83...|$|R
