25|$|The {{cognitive}} account {{suggests that}} memories are remembered best because they occur {{during a period}} of rapid change followed by a period of relative stability. There is an assumed memory advantage for the novel and distinct events that is followed by a period of stability. The novel events are subject to greater elaborative cognitive processing leading to better encoding of <b>these</b> <b>memories.</b> Moreover, the period of stability that follows increases the stability of the cues for <b>these</b> <b>memories</b> and increases the chances of recall.|$|E
25|$|Traumatic {{memories}} are formed after {{an experience that}} causes high levels of emotional arousal and the activation of stress hormones. <b>These</b> <b>memories</b> become consolidated, stable, and enduring long-term memories (LTMs) through the synthesis of proteins {{only a few hours}} after the initial experience.|$|E

30|$|Results {{from the}} {{analysis}} are reported in four sections: (1) the repositories accessed for teaching-related information during planning; (2) the specific retrieval functions that faculty use to access these repositories; (3) patterns in how <b>these</b> <b>memory</b> and retrieval functions operate in practice (i.e., decision chains and implicated contextual factors); and, (4) {{the degree to which}} the USE project influenced <b>these</b> <b>memory</b> and/or retrieval functions.|$|R

25|$|Increasing {{levels of}} the stress hormone {{cortisol}} late in sleep (often during REM sleep) causes this decreased communication. One stage of memory consolidation is the linking of distant but related memories. Payne and Nadal hypothesize <b>these</b> <b>memories</b> are then consolidated into a smooth narrative, similar to a process that happens when memories are created under stress.|$|E
25|$|NAND flash {{architecture}} {{was introduced}} by Toshiba in 1989. <b>These</b> <b>memories</b> are accessed much like block devices, such as hard disks. Each block consists {{of a number of}} pages. The pages are typically 512 or 2,048 or 4,096 bytes in size. Associated with each page are a few bytes (typically 1/32 of the data size) {{that can be used for}} storage of an error correcting code (ECC) checksum.|$|E
25|$|Memories of 'future relevance' {{are also}} {{consolidated}} greater during sleep. In {{a study by}} Wilhelm et al., 2011, memories of items that participants knew were needed for the future (for the testing session) were remembered more after sleep. Sleep consolidated <b>these</b> <b>memories</b> of future relevance to a greater extent. Memories that are emotionally significant and relevant for the future are therefore preferentially consolidated during sleep. This can translate to mean that memories that are more meaningful or valuable to a person are consolidated more.|$|E

50|$|These prefetches are {{non-blocking}} <b>memory</b> operations, i.e. <b>these</b> <b>memory</b> accesses do {{not interfere}} with actual memory accesses. They do not change {{the state of the}} processor or cause page faults.|$|R
50|$|In native {{debugger}} programs, {{a memory}} map {{refers to the}} mapping between loaded executable/library files and <b>memory</b> regions. <b>These</b> <b>memory</b> maps are used to resolve memory addresses (such as function pointers) to actual symbols.|$|R
25|$|The narrative/identity account {{suggests}} that the reminiscence bump occurs because {{a sense of identity}} develops during adolescence and early adulthood. Research {{suggests that}} memories that have more influence and significance to one's self are more frequently rehearsed in defining one's identity, and are therefore better remembered later in life (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). Identity formation provides added motivation for using cognitive processes to ensure recall of <b>these</b> <b>memories.</b> The events from this period {{are more likely to be}} organized into a story or view of oneself, and benefits from the advantage of schematic organization in memory.|$|E
25|$|<b>These</b> <b>memories</b> {{have been}} tested in {{different}} ways, including measuring the ability to recall details of the event {{and the impact of}} additional cues on the recall of the event. Denver, Lane and Cherry found that flashbulb memories {{that took place in the}} reminiscence bump were exceptionally vivid and easily accessible. It is suggested that the flashbulb memories encoded during the reminiscence bump are so vivid because the events happened during a time of identity formation and peak brain function. Additionally, these events are recalled well because they undergo more rehearsal due to their serious nature and frequent discussion.|$|E
25|$|The song's lyrics {{feature the}} phrase {{identity}} ga nai, umarenai, which leads {{the song and}} feature in the song's chorus. The song's protagonist says that going by measures such as what his favourite clothes, books and food are, he's just a regular person, and that him thinking about the morning's rain {{that led to a}} woman's shirt becoming set were inelegant thoughts. A scene is depicted in the lyrics where someone {{at the beginning of a}} concert compares himself with the other members of the audience, and realises that comparing yourself to others is not a proper way to live. Later, he thinks about childhood memories of defeat, and realises that <b>these</b> <b>memories</b> are his pure self. After understanding this, he feels like he wants to scream, and begins to cry.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{operating}} system (OS) designs provide inadequate isolation of user applications from errors {{that occur in}} OS services. If an error causes the failure of an OS service, all dependent applications are affected. The OS design described in this paper ameliorates this problem by reorganizing OS state {{in an effort to}} make OS services transparently restartable. This is achieved by partitioning application-related OS state into isolated per-application memory regions. Access to <b>these</b> <b>memory</b> regions is provided to OS services on a “need-to-know ” basis when processing application requests. Applications are not allowed access to <b>these</b> <b>memory</b> regions for security. This design helps improve the dependability of the system. ...|$|R

25|$|Researchers {{have studied}} {{different}} types of memories {{in order to find}} some clues into how the reminiscence bump works and how memories are stored and retrieved. Participants were asked to retrieve memories that were classified as either public or private to try to find differences in terms of when <b>these</b> <b>memories</b> were stored. Public events are events that everyone living at the time know about and are exposed to (political, war/murder, sports/entertainment or news events), but private events are only experienced by the individual (relationships, births/deaths, work/education, home/leisure, illness and religion). When recalling public events, participants were between ages 10 and 19; and when recalling private events, participants were between 20 and 29. Researchers suggest that public events are recalled at an earlier age because individuals are gaining a sense of generational identity. People are starting to create their own beliefs and their individual identity, so these experiences are being rehearsed, practiced and stored in long-term memory. Private events are recalled later because this is when individuals are developing intimate relationship. Private events are more easily stored and recalled because they are unique to each person and are likely occurring without any outside influence.|$|E
25|$|There, {{they meet}} {{a woman named}} Alexandra (Mayumi Yanagisawa/Jeannie Elias). She tells them she {{is the owner of}} the Palace, and the moon-person they fought is called Sirus, and is only a child; an orphan whom Alexandra adopted. However, because of the evil inside him, he has {{forgotten}} that time. She asks them to restore the garden of the Palace to try to remind Sirus of his old life. They do so, and confront Griffon, who experiences a memory of Sirus lamenting how humans have nearly destroyed the world fighting for the atlamillia, and musing that things would be better if humans didn't exist. <b>These</b> <b>memories</b> weaken Griffon, and Max and Monica defeat him. He turns back into Sirus, and a Dark Element (Hiroshi Iwasaki/Cam Clarke) rises out of his body, calling the Star of Oblivion. The Element reveals that it was born from Sirus's hatred for humans, and plans to rule over the destroyed planet. Max and Monica defeat the Element, helped by Sirus, who is mortally wounded. Before he dies, he remembers who he really is – the Guardian of the Stars, with the power to stop the Star of Oblivion. He does so, and Alexandra appears, telling him he has done well. He thanks Max and Monica for saving him, and then dies, re-joining Alexandra in the garden. Max and Monica discuss how Griffon never really existed, but was instead an evil created in the heart of humans. At Kazarov, they say goodbye, vowing never to forget one another. Elena also says goodbye to Max as Paznos returns to its own time.|$|E

500|$|Born John Bateman, the {{character}} later known as Lucas North {{was raised in}} rural Cumbria, where {{his father was a}} Methodist minister. During his time at Leeds University he lived with Maya Lahan (Laila Rouass). While enrolled at Leeds he visited Dakar, Senegal, where he engaged in shipping cannabis to Hamburg in exchange for money. When he was caught the authorities took the shipment and his money, stranding him in Dakar. To gain enough money {{to get back to the}} UK, he worked in a casino. [...] While working there John Bateman was approached by Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen), who persuaded him to deliver packages for him. One of the packages delivered by Bateman was a bomb that exploded at a British Embassy, killing 17 people. To escape the country Bateman killed a friend of his named Lucas North. [...] North had just made it past the first battery of tests for admission to MI5. Bateman assumed North's identity and left Maya behind. Bateman/North would later suppress <b>these</b> <b>memories,</b> believing that Vaughn was solely responsible for the bombing and for his friend's death. He would later join MI5 in place of the real Lucas North and become head of Section D. He was also once married to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza). During an operation in Russia, Lucas North was captured and imprisoned for eight years, during which time he was often subjected to torture.|$|E
500|$|In StarCraft II, Kerrigan {{launches}} {{an attack}} on the Terran Dominion colonies. At first, her motives seem to be revenge - however, later it is discovered that she is pursuing various pieces of a Xel'naga artifact of great power. Coincidentally, these are the same artifacts that Jim Raynor is pursuing at the request of his recently freed friend Tychus Findlay and his benefactor, the Moebius Foundation. Raynor's forces and Kerrigan constantly bump heads throughout this pursuit, with Kerrigan displaying her now trademark character traits of arrogance and a hunger for power. Raynor soon learns from Valerian Mengsk, son of Arcturus Mengsk and the real face behind the Moebius Foundation, that the Xel'naga artifacts he has been pursuing, when pieced together, have the power to return Kerrigan to her human form. [...] At one point, Zeratul suddenly appears on board Raynor's ship and hands to him a crystal containing memories from his recent ventures. The memories on the crystal chronicle Zeratul's campaign to discover the truth behind an ancient Xel'naga prophecy, a quest which leads him to run into Kerrigan many times in the process. It is through <b>these</b> <b>memories</b> that Raynor learns just {{how important it is to}} ensure that Kerrigan does not perish, for she is the chosen person to help win the coming battle against the Protoss-Zerg hybrids. Through Zeratul's crystal, Raynor is also granted the vision of a possible future, one without Kerrigan, where the Protoss are rendered extinct shortly after the Terrans are annihilated. After seeing this vision, Raynor mounts an invasion on Char in collaboration with Dominion forces to eliminate the Zerg forces on the planet. The Xel'naga artifact releases an energy blast that wipes the Zerg infection clean off the planet. When Raynor and Findlay seek Kerrigan in the ruins, she is found to have mostly returned to her human form, with only her hair remaining Zerg-like. However, Raynor is forced to kill Findlay when he attempts to assassinate Kerrigan, under orders from his [...] "benefactor", who is revealed to be Arcturus Mengsk. Raynor then carries the weakened Kerrigan over the ruined battlefield to safety.|$|E
