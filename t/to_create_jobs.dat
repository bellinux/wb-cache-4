5|$|Construction of Lerkendal {{started as}} a public works during the 1930s, as a measure <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>jobs.</b> It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>jobs.</b> Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E

A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana's business practices, including a court judgment {{on the eve of}} the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes, but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted in a criminal conviction.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>jobs.</b> Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E
5|$|When Bevin {{told the}} media {{he would have}} an {{announcement}} at his campaign headquarters on April 28, speculation raged that he would {{drop out of the}} race. Instead, Bevin announced that he would release his jobs plan later in the week and chided the local media for focusing on issues other than the economy. On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law. Saying that burdensome regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>jobs,</b> he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million.

When jobs were scarce some employers even dismissed blacks <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>jobs</b> for whites.
