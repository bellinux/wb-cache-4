5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E
