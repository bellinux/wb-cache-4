5|$|Calgary {{had been}} served for 30 {{years by the}} Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total {{capacity}} of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> rather than hope {{to be a team}} selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, {{including}} mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, {{and other}} non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow {{parts of the}} RNA <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.|$|E

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had been}} hailed as a hero, first for saving the Colonels from moving to Cincinnati and then for {{bringing}} a championship to Louisville, Brown came under intense public criticism following the Colonels' championship season for selling the rights to center Dan Issel to the Baltimore Claws in a cost-saving move. He frequently clashed with coach Hubie Brown during the 1975–76 season, {{and at the end}} of the year, he accepted $3 million <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> the team during the 1976 ABA–NBA merger rather than paying $3 million for the team to join the National Basketball Association (NBA).|$|E
5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire.

5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista.

In a more recent (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E

5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The V-22's {{development}} {{process has been}} long and controversial, partly due to its large cost increases, {{some of which are}} caused by the requirement <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> wing and rotors to fit aboard ships. The development budget was first planned for $2.5 billion in 1986, which increased to a projected $30 billion in 1988. By 2008, $27 billion had been spent on the program and another $27.2 billion was required to complete planned production numbers. Between 2008 and 2011, the estimated lifetime cost for maintaining the V-22 grew by 61 percent, mostly allocated to maintenance and support.|$|E

5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need <b>to</b> <b>fold.</b> In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region.

This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|The state {{experienced}} budget shortages {{because of}} low tax revenues, which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects. The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands. The state's spending and borrowing led to short-term budget problems, but despite early setbacks (poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> {{because of lack of}} funds), the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state. By 1810 the Indiana Territory's population within the boundaries of the new state was 24, 520. In the decades following his governorship, Indiana's population grew from sixty-five thousand in 1816 to 147,178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E

In 2002, Team Bath became the first university team to enter the FA Cup in 120years, and advanced through four qualifying rounds to the first round proper. The university's team was established in 1999 while the city team has existed since before 1908 (when it entered the Western League).
