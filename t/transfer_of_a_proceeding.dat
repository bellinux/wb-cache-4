50|$|The {{charges on}} the specialpair + and the BPh− could undergo charge {{recombination}} in this state. This would waste the high-energy electron and convert the absorbed light energy into heat. Several factors {{of the reaction}} center structure serve to prevent this. First, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electron from BPh− to P960+ is relatively slow compared to two other redox reactions in the reaction center. The faster reactions involve the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electron from BPh− (BPh− is oxidised to BPh) to the electron acceptor quinone (QA), and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electron to P960+ (P960+ is reduced to P960) from a heme in the cytochrome subunit above the reaction center.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{this thesis}} is the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security. The thesis is focused {{mainly on the}} history <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security, its regulation in Civil code 2012 and it highlights the fundamental changes compared to its regulation in Civil code 1964. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security underwent considerable changes in Civil code 2012. However, the usage of this instrument in practice, compared to other security instruments, is not so common. The fault is primarily with the insufficient regulation in the Civil code 1964 {{which has led to}} extensive discussions on this topic in the past as well as restrictions by the Supreme Court. The main aim of this thesis is to evaluate the benefits of the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security in Civil code 2012 as compared to 1964. Introductory chapters are dedicated to general issues of the law of obligations, focusing on changes of the basic terms. Other chapters include historical development of the institute and evaluate the applicability of the existing jurisprudence in light of the Civil code 2012. Following chapters deal with the issues of formal and content requirements for the contract on <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security. Next chapters describe the process of realization <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> right [...] ...|$|R
