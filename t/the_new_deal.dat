5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} proposed <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> {{to combat}} the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal,</b> since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, {{a member of the}} ACLU.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick Dilling (April 19, 1894 – May 26, 1966) was an American {{writer and}} {{political}} activist. In 1934, she published The Red Network—A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots, which catalogs over 1,300 suspected communists and their sympathizers.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal's</b> record {{came under}} attack by New Left historians in the 1960s for its pusillanimity in not attacking {{capitalism}} more vigorously, nor helping blacks achieve equality. The critics emphasize {{the absence of a}} philosophy of reform to explain <b>the</b> failure of <b>New</b> Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal's</b> commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy, and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.|$|R
5|$|George B. Martin, who {{had served}} six months in the Senate in 1918 after being {{appointed}} to fill a vacancy, opposed Barkley in the 1932 primary, but Barkley defeated him by a two-to-one margin. In the general election, he defeated Republican Congressman Maurice H. Thatcher {{by a vote of}} 575,077 to 393,865, marking {{the first time in the}} 20th century that a Kentucky senator won a second consecutive term. Democrats gained control of the Senate during the 1932 elections; Joseph Robinson was chosen majority leader, and he appointed Barkley as his assistant. Together, they secured passage of New Deal legislation, including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the Federal Emergency Relief Act. In July 1934, the Democratic National Committee chose Barkley to respond to Republican National Committee chairman Henry P. Fletcher's radio attacks on <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b> Later that year, he embarked on a tour of twenty states, defending <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> and stumping for Democratic candidates in the 1934 midterm elections.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Increased federal {{spending}} {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in Washington.

5|$|The {{economic}} policies of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies {{were subject to}} a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E

When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, McNary {{supported}} the development of federal hydroelectric power dams, and in 1933, he introduced legislation {{that led to the}} building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as public works projects. He voted for the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b> Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin F. Stapleton was {{the mayor}} of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was {{responsible}} for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b> During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport {{has been replaced by}} a neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.|$|E
5|$|Charles Linza McNary (June 12, 1874February 25, 1944) was a United States Republican {{politician}} from Oregon.

In the Senate, McNary helped to pass legislation {{that led to the}} construction of Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, and worked on agricultural and forestry issues. He also supported many of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> programs {{at the beginning of the}} Great Depression. Until Mark O.

30|$|Fifth, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Green <b>Deal</b> is {{conducive to}} {{smoothing}} fiscal revenue allocation between central and local governments and among local governments. Under the Deal, the boundary between central revenue and local revenue could be distinctly defined by an ecological compensation system; {{with the help of}} which, there would be effective fiscal revenue allocation between central and local governments. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> Green <b>Deal</b> will streamline the urban–rural relationship. There is a complete set of key performance indicators for industrialization, urbanization, and agriculture modernization in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Green <b>Deal.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Green <b>Deal</b> is based on the theory of the welfare economy, it emphasizes the integration of the economy and social theory. It pays attention to both economic development and people's well-being, like employment and living standards. Therefore, it will strive {{to strike a balance between}} economic and social development. Moreover, the Deal is beneficial for streamlining the relationship between the government and civil organization. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> Green <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> is only a facilitator of reform and will not be able to complete all the tasks of reform.|$|R
