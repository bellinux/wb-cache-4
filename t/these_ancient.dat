5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, {{especially from the}} Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity..|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the tombs}} have {{graffiti}} written by <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> tourists. Jules Baillet has located over 2,100 Greek and Latin instances of graffiti, {{along with a}} smaller number in Phoenician, Cypriot, Lycian, Coptic, and other languages. The majority of the ancient graffiti is found in KV9, which contains just under a thousand of them. The earliest positively dated graffiti dates to 278 B.C.|$|E

5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} log and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|These Precambrian igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Tod also {{submitted}} archæological {{papers to}} the Royal Asiatic Society's Transactions series. He {{was interested in}} numismatics as well, and he discovered the first specimens of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins from the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great, which were described in his books. <b>These</b> <b>ancient</b> kingdoms had been largely forgotten or considered semi-legendary, but Tod's findings confirmed the long-term Greek presence in Afghanistan and Punjab. Similar coins {{have been found in}} large quantities since his death.|$|E
60|$|Now I do not {{complain}} of <b>these</b> <b>ancients</b> {{so much because}} their logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths--the one of creeping and the one of crawling--to which they have dared to confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.|$|R

5|$|Building on his progress, Champollion now {{began to}} study other texts in {{addition}} to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1823, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> texts. With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the playable races, {{there are two other}} non-playable Enlightened Races, known as the Zilart and the Kuluu. <b>These</b> <b>ancient</b> races were thought extinct, and are the focus of the first two-game expansions. There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests, missions and the game's storylines. The game features several typical Final Fantasy fiends, including Goblins, Sahagins and Tonberries. Several of these races are known as Beastmen, a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence, exhibiting self-awareness, emotions, culture, and religion. The complex relationship, bigoted views, and reasons of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Legends of vampires {{have existed}} for millennia; {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Mesopotamians, Hebrews, ancient Greeks, and Romans had tales of demonic entities and blood-drinking spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century Southeastern Europe, particularly Transylvania as verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire itself. Belief in such legends became so rife that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|Poison was {{discovered}} in ancient times, and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure {{the death of their}} prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly {{at the time of the}} Roman Empire, one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.|$|E
5|$|The Nerevarine {{is invited}} to the palace of the poet god-king Vivec, {{one of the three}} deities that forms the basis of Morrowind's religion, known as the Tribunal, to discuss the assault on Dagoth Ur's stronghold in the heart of Red Mountain. Vivec {{presents}} the player with the gauntlet 'Wraithguard', an ancient Dwemer artifact that allows the use of the tools Sunder and Keening. <b>These</b> <b>ancient</b> weapons were created by the Dwemer to tap into the power of the fabled Heart of Lorkhan, which they found beneath Red Mountain - and these same tools have been used by the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur to reach their god-like status.|$|E

5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} vampirism {{has existed for}} millennia.

5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from <b>these</b> <b>ancient</b> sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version {{of the myth}}, it {{is the basis for}} many later works.|$|E

A total of 21 archaeological sites have been discovered, three of which (on the island's northwest side) are larger than the others. [...] These sites include temple platforms, called marae, house sites, and graves. Comparisons with stone structures on Tuamotu atolls show that a population of between 100 and 200 natives could have produced all of the Malden structures. Maraes of a similar type are found on Raivavae, one of the Austral Islands. Various wells used by <b>these</b> <b>ancients</b> were found by later settlers to be dry or brackish.|$|R

5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. <b>These</b> <b>ancient</b> armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|Dancing is {{a popular}} pastime in Wales; {{traditional}} dances include folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out; this is attributed {{to the influence of}} Nonconformists and their belief that any physical diversion was worthless and satanic, especially mixed dancing. <b>These</b> <b>ancient</b> dances, orally passed down, were almost single-handedly rescued by Lois Blake (1890–1974) who recorded them in numerous instruction pamphlets, recording both steps and music. In a similar vein, clog dancing was preserved and developed by the likes of Howel Wood (1882–1967) who perpetuated the art at local and national stages. Clog dancing, traditionally a male dominated art, is now a common part of eisteddfodau. In 2010, a 30-year traditional dance festival held in Caernarvon came to an end {{due to a lack of}} participants, though clog dancing has seen a revival in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. <b>These</b> <b>ancient</b> lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E
