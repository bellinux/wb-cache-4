Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named {{it as one}} of his favorite episodes of the series, calling it [...] "not only funny and moving, but incredibly important", both for its religious element and message of <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Stack</b> praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a [...] "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E
40|$|AbstractGeometric {{dimensioning}} and Tolerancing (GDT) {{constitutes the}} dominant approach for design and manufacture of mechanical parts that control inevitable dimensional and geometrical deviations within appropriate limits. The stack up of tolerances and their redistribution without hampering the functionality {{is very important}} for cost optimization. This paper presents a methodology that aims towards the systematic solution of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up problem involving geometric characteristics. Conventional <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up analysis is usually difficult as it involves numerous rule and conditions. The methodology presented i. e. generic capsule method is straightforward and easy to use for stack up of geometrical tolerances of components and their assembly using graphical approach. In the work presented in this paper, angularity tolerance has been considered for illustration of the methodology. Two approaches viz. Worst Case (WC) and Root Sum Square (RSS) have been used. An example of dovetail mounting mechanism has been taken for purpose of stack up of angularity. This assembly consists of two parts i. e. dovetail male and dovetail female. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up has been done both for the components and their assembly. Need for computerisation of methodology for geometrical <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up of large assemblies has emerged out as the limitation of the proposed method...|$|E

The tolerances obtained from <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> are put to test for process capability studies (Sharma and Rao 2013). Then the improved C p and C pk values obtained are compared for optimum tolerance value using a tolerance capability expert software. Finally, the paper is concluded with a discussion on the results obtained.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{describe}} various <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> methods without going into the theoretical details and derivations behind them. For those the reader is referred to Scholz (1995). For each method we present the assumptions and then give the <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> formulas. This will allow the user to make an informed choice among the manyavailable methods. The methods covered are: worst case or arithmetic tolerancing, simple statistical tolerancing or the RSS method, RSS methods with inflation factors which account for nonnormal distributions, tolerancing with mean shifts, where the latter are stacked arithmeticallyor statisticallyin different ways, depending on how one views the tradeoff between part to part variation and mean shifts...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{platform}} geometrical sensitivity value for a part has been defined. Calculation and simulation {{methods have been}} defined and tested {{to be used in}} industrial “real-life” environments. Present calculation and simulation methods for assembly analysis in a single product development have been used as a basis. These methods have been further developed and adapted to suit product family development, or platforms. The assembly geometrical sensitivity value can be used to predict the effect of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> without having data of tolerance sizes available. Using sensitivity calculation in each assembly step gives an indication of the risk of functional failure and non-fulfilled specifications due to <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking.</b> The platform geometrical sensitivity value could be used for optimization of a part or an assembly, by means of geometric variation, not only for one product environment but also for a complete product family simultaneously. This decreases the risk of sub-optimization of part location and assembly concepts. Using the platform geometrical sensitivity value, the effect of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> could be predicted for all assemblies conceptually and the result can be used to dimension specific part tolerances. All equations and mathematical connections are described in detail in the paper but, due to the mathematical complexity of 3 D modeling, the calculations have been performed in a geometry simulation tool.

40|$|The <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking</b> problem {{arises in}} the context of {{assemblies}} from interchangeable parts because of the inability to produce or to join parts exactly according to nominal dimensions. Either the relevant part 2 ̆ 7 s dimension varies around some nominal values from part to part or the act of assembly that leads to variation. For example, as runner of Francis turbine is joined with turbine shaft via mechanical lock, there is not only variation in the diameter of runner and the concentricity between the runner hole and turbine shaft, but also the variation in concentricity between the outer parts of runner to runner hole. Thus, there is the possibility that the assembly of such interacting parts won 2 ̆ 7 t function or won 2 ̆ 7 t come together as planned.

40|$|During routine {{inspections}} of the Space Shuttle's Main Propulsion System (MPS) Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) pre-valve, the mechanism provided {{to maintain the}} valve {{in the open position}} was found cracked. The mechanism is a Vespel roller held against the valve visor by a stack of Belleville springs. The roller has been found cracked 3 times. All three instances were in the same valve in the same location. There are 6 pre-valves on each orbiter, and only one has exhibited this problem. Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification <b>tolerance</b> <b>stack</b> up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress riser.

However, engineering semantics is not maintained in these mathematic models. It is hard to interpret calculated numerical results in a meaningful way. In this paper, a new semantic tolerance modeling scheme based on modal interval is proposed to improve interpretability of tolerance modeling.

40|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that design for manufacture and design for assembly {{have a significant impact}} on the success of a product. One of the key issues is tolerance specification and thus it is important for the designer to consider tolerance analysis thoroughly in the early stages of product development. With minor modifications and ifused properly, tolerance charting can be a valuable tool to the product designer. This paper illustrates two methods used to tackle tolerance balancing for assembly and provides an insight into the considerations to be taken into account. A manual methodfirst demonstrates the fundamental concepts while a computer aided version further enhances the charting process. The latter is easy to apply and renders greater flexibility during problem formulation. Consequently, what-if analysis is possible and thus better results can be achieved. However, it should be cautioned that tolerance charts are merely tools; the results they produce can only be as good as the inputs they receive and thus a ‘perfect ’ solution cannot be guaranteed. Nonetheless, tolerance charting is an effective diagnostic tool as it provides tolerance analysis in the early stage of products development.

50|$|Almost all {{engineering}} drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate {{not only}} geometry (shape and location) but also {{dimensions and tolerances}} for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object's length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed interchangeable manufacture, these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. Coordinate dimensioning involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only <b>tolerance</b> zones, <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking)</b> to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form shapes/locations and sizes).|$|R

To successfully achieve this transition, a fully-functional fuel cell automatic stack assembly robotic station is being developed. This document outlines both iterations of the robotic fuel cell assembly stations, other work to date, DFM and DFA lessons learned, and the anticipated future progression of automatic fuel cell stack assembly stations. Two individual robotic fuel cell assembly stations were constructed, including custom-built end effectors and parts feeders. The second station incorporated numerous improvements, including overlapping work envelopes, elimination of a shuttle cart, software synchronization, fewer axes, and a better end effector. Consequentially, the second workcell achieved a four-fold improvement in cycle time over the previous iteration. Future improvements will focus in part upon improving the reliability of the overall system.

40|$|Virtually all {{manufacturing}} processes {{are subject to}} variability, an inherent characteristic of most production processes. No two parts can ever be exactly the same {{in terms of their}} dimensions. For machining processes such as drilling, milling, and lathing, overall variability is caused in part by machine tools, tooling, fixtures and workpiece material. Since variability, which can be accumulated from <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacking,</b> can result in defective parts the number of parts produced in a batch is limited. When there are too many parts in a batch, the likelihood of producing all acceptable parts in a batch decreases due to the increased tolerances. On the other hand, too small a batch size incurs an increase of manufacturing costs due to frequent setups and tool replacements, whereas the likelihood of acceptable parts increases. To address this challenge, we present a stochastic model for determining the optimal batch size where we consider part-to-part variation in terms of tool wear, which tends to be proportional to batch size. In this paper, a mathematical model is constructed {{based on the assumption that}} the process used for producing preceding parts affects the state of subsequent parts in a probabilistic manner. close...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a computer program}} for process planning and fixture design. It utilizes the principles of workpiece control, in particular dimensional and geometric control, to sequence the machining operations and to design the 3 - 2 - 1 location systems. The system developed uses the matrix spatial representation, a series of two-dimensional arrays, to describe the workpiece geometry. The system is capable of sequencing three types of machined features requiring milling operations: plane surfaces, slots, and steps. These features may be regarded as two-dimensional type: they can be completely specified dimensionally in two orthogonal projection views. Other data required by the system include the surfaces to be machined, cutting conditions, dimensions and tolerances of the stock and of the finished part. These data are either interactively input into the system or stored in a prepared data file for the system to read. The outputs include the process picture showing all locating surfaces in the 3 - 2 - 1 location system for each operation, {{and a set of}} three tolerance charts for analysing all dimensions of the machined part. The results of this research indicate that the automatic machining sequence planning can be achieved through the implementation of the concept of workpiece control together with the practicality in machining a machined feature. The research also emphasises a significant role of the tolerance charts which have been used in manual process planning for a long time, but have not yet been exploited to its full advantage in computerised process planning. Regarding tolerance charts, the research has developed a new method for calculating <b>tolerance</b> <b>stacks</b> which can be used for computerized as well as manual charting.

40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} to measure the sway of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center. This system was installed in the VAB and gathered more than one total year of data. The building movement was correlated with measurements provided by three wind towers {{in order to determine}} the maximum deflection of the building during high-wind events. The VAB owners were in the process of obtaining new platforms for use in assembling very tall rockets when analysis of the VAB showed that a high wind could move the building sufficiently that an upper platform might impact a rocket. The problem arises because safety requires a relatively small gap between the platform and the rocket, while a large enough gap is needed to ensure that <b>stacking</b> <b>tolerances</b> prevent contact between the rocket and the platform. This only leaves an inch or two (approximately 2 to 5 cm) of total clearance, so when the analysis showed that more than a couple of inches of motion could occur in a high wind, there was a potential for damaging the rocket. The KSC Applied Physics Laboratory was asked to install a system in the VAB that could measure the motion of the building in high winds to determine the actual building sway. The motion of the VAB roof under wind load was measured optically, and under analysis, it was determined that a relatively large-aperture optical system would be required to reduce diffraction effects to less than a small fraction of an inch (approximately mm) at a distance of 500 ft (150 m). A 10 -in. (approximately 250 mm) telescope was placed on the floor of the building, looking at the ceiling. On the ceiling, a flat plate with three white LEDs was mounted in an "L" shape, such that the telescope was essentially looking at three stars. Software was written to track the motion of these three points using an image processing system. This provided a better than 1 / 10 -in.

The crew did not notice any other abnormalities leading up to, or for the remaining 1 hour of flight and made an uneventful landing. Upon taxi into the chocks, the recovery ground crew noticed the high frequency long wire antenna had become disconnected from the vertical stabilizer and was trailing over the left inboard wing, and that the left engine upper center removable cowling panel was missing, with noticeable damage to the left engine inboard cowling fixed structure. The missing cowling panel was never recovered. Each engine cowling panel is attached to the engine nacelle using six bushings made of 17 - 4 PH steel.
