Staggered tuning also increases the steepness of passband skirts and hence improves selectivity.The value of staggered tuning is best explained by first looking at the shortcomings of tuning every stage identically. This method is called synchronous tuning. Each stage of the amplifier will reduce the bandwidth. In an amplifier with multiple identical stages, the 3 dB points of the response after the first stage will become the 6 dB points of the second stage. Each successive stage will add a further 3 dB to what was the band edge of the first stage. Thus the 3 dB bandwidth becomes progressively narrower with each additional stage.|$|E

5000|$|Hazeltine's {{innovation}} was to add {{a circuit}} to each radio frequency amplifier stage which fed back {{a small amount of}} energy from the plate (output) circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite phase to cancel ("neutralize") the feedback which was causing the oscillation. This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets. A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured [...] "Neutrodyne" [...] receivers throughout the 1920s. [...] At the time, RCA held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong regenerative and superheterodyne circuits. The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior superheterodyne the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early superhets. After manufacture each <b>tuned</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage had to be neutralized, adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the parasitic oscillations which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in North America.|$|E
