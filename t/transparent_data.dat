50|$|In {{computer}} science, an opaque {{data type}} is a data type whose concrete data structure is not defined in an interface.

The concrete representation of the type is hidden from its users, and the visible implementation is incomplete. A data type whose representation is visible is called <b>transparent.</b> Opaque <b>data</b> types are frequently used to implement abstract data types.|$|R

50|$|<b>Transparent</b> <b>Data</b> Encryption (often {{abbreviated}} to TDE) is a technology employed by Microsoft, IBM and Oracle to encrypt database files. TDE offers encryption at file level. TDE solves {{the problem of}} protecting data at rest, encrypting databases both on the hard drive and consequently on backup media. It does not protect data in transit nor data in use. Enterprises typically employ TDE to solve compliance issues such as PCI DSS which require the protection of data at rest.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the scalability (in {{terms of the}} number of nodes) of a packet-switched WDM all-optical bi-directional ring for metropolitan area networks. The nodes enable adding/dropping packets to/from all WDM channels on the ring. The nodes are optically <b>transparent</b> to <b>data</b> packets that bypass them. At a linespeed of 2. 5 Gbps using directly modulated DFB lasers separated by 400 GHz, EDFAs to compensate for optical power loss and Phasars for wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing it has been experimentally observed that a single ring can support upto 8 transparent nodes. 1...|$|R

50|$|Using {{a special}} design allows the reuse {{of the old}} wayside signals - the <b>transparent</b> <b>data</b> balises are {{connected}} to the older distant and stop signals. Given the lower maximum speed of the rapid transit system the Eurobalises can be placed at shorter distance (every four sleepers). The cab computer software is much simpler as the weight of the train can be inferred from an assumed maximum. The sum of advantages makes the system faster and cheaper than using a plain ECTS level 1 train protection system.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent clients from {{depending}} on the implementation, an ADT is often packaged as an opaque data type {{in one or more}} modules, whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations. The implementation of the module—namely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure used—can then be hidden from most clients of the module. This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. If the implementation is exposed, it is known instead as a <b>transparent</b> <b>data</b> type.|$|E
5000|$|Enterprise requirements: These will {{generally}} include such elements as economical and effective system expansion, acceptable performance levels (especially system access speed), transaction reliability, and <b>transparent</b> <b>data</b> management. In addition, {{the conversion of}} raw data such as transaction records and image files into more useful information forms through such features as data warehouses is also a common organizational requirement, since this enables managerial decision making and other organizational processes. One of the architecture techniques is the split between managing transaction data and (master) reference data. Another one is splitting data capture systems from data retrieval systems (as done in a data warehouse).|$|E
