This study was carried out on this material for achieving mirror finish and minimizing profile error.

The surface roughness and profile accuracy were significantly affected by <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius, feed rate, and spindle speed and depth of cut had insignificant effect.

Increased <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius caused a ripple like effect on the machined surface as compared to a digging effect with low or no <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius and thus showed a better surface finish. The profile error, however, increased with <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius. Subsequently, both surface roughness and profile accuracy were optimized together using grey relational grade to obtain a globally optimized solution.

It {{is a process}} of {{mechanical}} machining of precision elements using lathes or derivative machine tools (e.g., turn-mills, rotary transfers) equipped with natural or synthetic diamond-tipped tool bits. The term single-point diamond turning (SPDT) is sometimes applied, although as with other lathe work, the [...] "single-point" [...] label is sometimes only nominal (radiused <b>tool</b> <b>noses</b> and contoured form tools being options). The process of diamond turning is widely used to manufacture high-quality aspheric optical elements from crystals, metals, acrylic, and other materials. Plastic optics are frequently molded using diamond turned mold inserts. Optical elements produced by the means of diamond turning are used in optical assemblies in telescopes, video projectors, missile guidance systems, lasers, scientific research instruments, and numerous other systems and devices. Most SPDT today is done with computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. Diamonds also serve in other machining processes, such as milling, grinding, and honing.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new three {{dimensional}} cutting process model. The basic features and improvements over previously developed models include: (1) Cutting force calculations {{based on the}} concept of equivalent orthogonal cutting process (EOC), which converts the modelling of three dimensional cutting processes into the modelling or orthogonal cutting processes. In the model, both cutting force coefficient and chip load are considered as the functions of cutting conditions, tool geometry, and machine-tool structural vibrations. (2) Microstructure hardness variation of workpiece material has been taken into consideration. (3) The regenerative mechanism and mode coupling effect in machining are included. The structural dynamics equations, which include five vibration modes, are {{in the form of a}} set of simultaneous differential equations. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is applied to solve these equations numerically. Based on the proposed model, systematic simulation of turning processes has been conducted. The simulation results show that feed and <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius are the primary cutting parameters in determining surface finish. Surface finish improves with the decrease of feed. The effect of <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius is not monotonic: surface finish improves with the increase of <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius when the <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius is below a certain limit. However, above that limit, surface finish becomes worse with the further increase of <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius. Cutting speed, depth of cut and tool geometrical angles are secondary parameters in determining surface finish, and have much smaller influences. The simulation results of surface finish are verified experimentally. The simulated surface finish are in agreement with the experimental results.

Increasing the cutting edge angle for these tools generally resulted in an increase in the magnitude of thermal stresses. Qualitative criteria for film fracture was also applied, which revealed that film failure is most likely to occur in thick films and for cutting tools with large cutting edge angles and r/h ratios less than 1. 0.
