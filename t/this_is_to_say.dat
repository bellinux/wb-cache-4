Transfer, between bodies, of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies.

2500|$|In 1988 a study {{published}} in Annals of Neurology reporting findings from post-mortem examinations on 137 elderly persons unexpectedly revealed that there was a discrepancy between the degree of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and the clinical manifestations of the disease. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that some participants whose brains had extensive Alzheimer's disease pathology, clinically had no or very little manifestations of the disease. Furthermore, the study showed that these persons had higher brain weights and greater number of neurons as compared to age-matched controls. The investigators speculated with two possible explanations for this phenomenon: these people may have had incipient Alzheimer's disease but somehow avoided the loss of large numbers of neurons, or alternatively, started with larger brains and more neurons and thus might be said to have had a greater [...] "reserve".

2500|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} are {{the major}} source of human-generated neutrinos. The majority of energy in a nuclear reactor is generated by fission (the four main fissile isotopes in nuclear reactors are , , [...] and [...] ), but the resultant neutron-rich daughter nuclides are below the neutron drip line, and therefore rapidly undergo additional beta decays, each converting one neutron to a proton and releasing an electron antineutrino (...) [...] [...] Including these subsequent decays, the average nuclear fission releases about [...] of energy, of which roughly 95.5% is retained in the core as heat, and roughly 4.5% (or about [...] ) is radiated away as antineutrinos.

2500|$|If a team loses {{resource}} {{in the middle}} of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 overs and 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% [...] 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it lost the resources available between 40 overs and 8 wickets (77.8%) and 20 overs and 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% [...] 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% [...] 25.4% = 74.6%.|$|E

2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon {{assert that}} the {{organizing}} model has several key advantages that distinguish it from the servicing model, such {{as the fact that}} the organizing model promotes [...] "systematic," [...] proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union's goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved. More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the [...] "...core role of trade unions". <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the British union members felt the organizing model adhered to what unions should be doing in regard to their members.|$|E
