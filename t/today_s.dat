This increase in Gerdeme due mainly to flood the whole country fleeing Bulgarians. It is possible that the village is to be scaled according to legend, by combining several small villages that have suffered from Turkish robber bands. Here are the names of these settlements, located 4-5 km around the village today: Gulefirchevo, Pelifirchevo, Gerenya, Clapp, Irushtentsi, Evdzhika, Armudli (Krushevo today Sakartsi).

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{collection}} of papers presented at a workshop in 1999 on the evolution and effects of economic regulation in several industries. Countries around the world have been undergoing seemingly constant regulatory changes for the past decade. In the 1990 s industrialized countries began a process of deregulation, which many believe has gone too far, leading to renewed pressure for increased regulation. Developing countries, meanwhile, are liberalizing sectors once dominated by the state and struggling to develop effective regulations and regulatory agencies amidst competing interests. This collection of papers provides important and refreshing context to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> issues, reminding us that the debate over effective regulation is not new and that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> regulations have historical roots. The path-dependent nature of regulatory changes mean that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> regulations and industry structures are shaped in part by conditions put in place many years ago, and rationales for these rules are often ad-hoc and bear little relation to the reasons given {{at the beginning of the}} path. ...|$|E

This arises since the individual anticipates that, from <b>today</b> <b>s</b> perspective, she will make biased use of future subsidies. Hence, {{in order to create}} the same incentive effect, a future subsidy must be higher in present value terms...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} conclusions from the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Higher Volume Operations (HVO) Flight Experiment which NASA conducted to determine pilot acceptability of the HVO concept for normal conditions. The SATS HVO concept improves efficiency at non-towered, non-radar airports in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) while achieving a level of safety equal to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system. Reported are results from flight experiment data that indicate that the SATS HVO concept is viable. The success of the SATS HVO concept is based on acceptable pilot workload, performance, and subjective criteria {{when compared to the}} procedural control operations in use today at non-towered, non-radar controlled airfields in IMC. The HVO Flight Experiment, flown on NASA's Cirrus SR 22, used a subset of the HVO Simulation Experiment scenarios and evaluation pilots in order to validate the simulation experiment results. HVO and Baseline (<b>today</b> <b>s</b> system) scenarios flown included: single aircraft arriving for a GPS non-precision approach; aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft; and aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft and then conducting a missed approach. Results reveal that all twelve low-time instrument-rated pilots preferred SATS HVO when compared to current procedural separation operations. These pilots also flew the HVO procedures safely and proficiently without additional workload in comparison to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system (Baseline). Detailed results of pilot flight technical error, and their subjective assessments of workload and situation awareness are presented in this paper...|$|E
