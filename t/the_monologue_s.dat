In {{the course of the}} fifth performance, during a particularly dramatic <b>monologue,</b> <b>the</b> play’ <b>s</b> star, Yevgenya Dodina, tripped and broke her ankle. As a result of the main actress’s injury the theater was forced to cancel the play for many months.|$|R

5000|$|A study {{examining}} {{memory and}} embodied cognition illustrates that people remember {{more of the}} gist of a story when they physically act it out. [...] Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were [...] "Read Only," [...] "Writing," [...] "Collaborative Discussion," [...] "Independent Discussion," [...] and [...] "Improvisation." [...] All participants received a monologue about teen addiction and were told {{to pay attention to}} details about the character and action in <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> Participants were given 5 minutes to read <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> twice, unaware of a future recall test. In the [...] "Read Only" [...] condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> In <b>the</b> [...] "Writing" [...] condition participants responded to 5 questions about the story {{from the perspective of the}} character in <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> They had 6 minutes to answer each question. In the [...] "Collaborative Discussion" [...] condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the [...] "Writing" [...] group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women. They were also given 6 minutes per question and everyone participated in answering each question. The [...] "Independent Discussion" [...] condition was the same as the [...] "Collaborative Discussion," [...] except 1 person answered each question. In the [...] "Improvisation" [...] condition participants acted out 5 scenes from <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> in groups of 5 women. The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory for <b>the</b> <b>monologue.</b> Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once. Participants were given short prompts from lines in <b>the</b> <b>monologue,</b> which were excluded from the memory test. Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations. The recall test was <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> with 96 words or phrases missing. Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>monologue</b> is {{emblematic of}} the {{generation}} gap among older Norwegian atonal modernist composers and the younger generation of composers, who are more open to other, including traditional, musical styles. Thommessen had previously been Paus' teacher at the Norwegian Academy of Music. In his letter Thommessen chastised Paus for his tonal music. A long monologue on why Paus has misunderstood everything about music ends with the words [...] "I do not want any more verbal contact with you." [...] At the time <b>the</b> opera <b>monologue</b> premiered, <b>the</b> [...] "Teacher" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>monologue</b> remained anonymous. <b>The</b> <b>monologue</b> {{played an important role}} in an extensive debate on musical aesthetics in the music journal Ballade in 2015, during which the formerly anonymous [...] "Teacher" [...] was revealed by Paus to be Olav Anton Thommessen.|$|R
