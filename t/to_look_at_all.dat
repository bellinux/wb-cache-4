5|$|Suddenly, Shawn and Gus {{are locked}} in the library and it is lit on fire, but they are rescued by Father Peter Westley (Ray Wise). Bob, who is {{revealed}} to be Paula's biological father, explains that after World War I, his great-grandfather established the town with two other soldiers, intending to create a secluded utopia. After the sawmill fire in 1958, the town began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> outsiders as a threat. When Doc Gooden and Sheriff Jackson enter and hold him at gunpoint, Shawn deduces {{that they are the}} leaders of the other two founding families. Due to Gooden's infertility and Jackson's terminal cancer, Randy was the only known direct descendant and therefore the sole future leader. To stop Randy from leaving town with a paranoid Paula, the sheriff and doctor drowned her. After Lassiter and O'Hara arrive and arrest Gooden and Jackson, the group celebrates at the diner, only to be repulsed by a number of oddities referencing Twin Peaks.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage {{and puts it on}} her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

25|$|The airline {{suffered}} from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans generally did not trust any shipowners, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys. The Norwegian authorities in exile were also distrustful of DNL, because the airline had taken initiative to operate a route, essentially helping the German forces. There was also an uncertainty {{as to whether the}} national airline of Norway should continue to be private, or if a state-owned airline should be established. To look at the issue, the Norwegian authorities-in-exile established the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> matters regarding civil aviation. It was this board which was permitted to negotiate traffic rights with other countries, make purchase rights of aircraft and participated in the foundation of the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Swedish intercontinental airline, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik managed to purchase ten Douglas DC-4 {{at the end of the}} war; they had initially planned on selling some to DDL and DNL, but were not permitted to negotiate any agreements with DNL.|$|E
25|$|In Norway, DNL was {{permitted}} to operate a limited route in Northern Norway, until the pilots fled to Britain in 1941 to join the resistance. The airline suffered from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans regarded Norwegian shipowners as highly suspicious people, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys.

500|$|David Sims, also {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, {{called it a}} fitting end to the season, [...] "leaving {{absolutely}} everyone salivating for season two." [...] Writing for the Star-Ledger, Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ("I have to say, it’s a pleasure just <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister's tent") and {{the authenticity of the}} baby dragons ("And wow, HBO, seamless special effects here. Baby Dragon looks every bit as real as the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming. And if the creative team can keep up this level of quality, it's hard to imagine HBO shutting things down anytime soon, even with a budget that only figures to get higher. Dragons aren't cheap, but they're also amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Money was {{borrowed}} from Britain {{to fund the}} state's programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were [...] "conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook" [...] and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly our problems are becoming national in character... Our financial resources are curtailed {{and there is an}} immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. I am more convinced that we have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> our problems with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the cooperation of the Commonwealth {{for the benefit of the}} States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.|$|E
500|$|Following the cliffhanger of the first-season finale, Kindler {{worked to}} figure out how to {{conclude}} the story and managed to write the outlines of the first two episodes in two days. He also consulted with the writing team <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the problems on how to conclude the story. [...] "Eulogy" [...] was conceived as an important episode in the lives of the main characters following the aftermath of [...] "End of Nights", as well as dealing with the loss of Ashley. Kindler said of the episode [...] "it's one thing to end on a terrible tragic cliffhanger, it's another in a satisfactory manner lay all things to rest appropriately." [...] In writing the episode Cooper was knowledgeable on [...] "medical jargon," [...] as she once wrote for the medical drama series House. In writing his first script [...] "Hero", McCullough was initially concerned that it would be met by resistance from the producers because of the special effects that would be involved, but was [...] "floored" [...] to find out it was entirely possible because of Anthem Visual Effects. The producers were originally hesitant in including [...] "Hero" [...] as the fourth episode, as it was considered lighter in tone as Magnus was trying to get over Ashley's death from [...] "Eulogy". [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] came early in the development of the season, as Kindler wanted to show an episode about Magnus' work going [...] "horribly wrong," [...] and explore the opportunity to have the heroes warned that their work has consequences. Described as the [...] "darkest, scariest, creepiest episode ever" [...] by Tapping, it also featured scenes Kindler was never comfortable with, and did not want to show again, including the assault of naked women, and child killings.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asking whether}} God's works are perfect, I ought <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of them together, not at one isolation.

[...] Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven't established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider God's immense power, I can't deny that He has made — or, in any case, that He could have made — many other things, and I must therefore view myself as having a place in a universe.

2500|$|On 11 June, Carpenter warned {{he might}} need to invoke {{emergency}} powers and take control of all of WA's gas and electricity supplies, which would result in rolling stoppages, blackouts and brownouts. He also said he had discussed accessing emergency diesel supplies stored by the Department of Defence at Garden Island with Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard. [...] The state's Energy Minister, Fran Logan, said the decommissioned Muja AB coal-fired power station at Collie would be returned to service to supply 25 terajoules to industry. He estimated it would take up to six weeks before the plant was operational, and said, [...] "These units are old and not as environmentally friendly as new generators. However, the state is facing a significant gas shortage and we need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> avenues".|$|E
2500|$|Computing a {{lower bound}} [...] for [...] usually {{requires}} exhibiting a blue/red colouring of the graph [...] with no blue [...] subgraph and no red [...] subgraph. Such a counterexample {{is called a}} Ramsey graph. Brendan McKay maintains a list of known Ramsey graphs. Upper bounds are often considerably more difficult to establish: one either has to check all possible colourings to confirm {{the absence of a}} counterexample, or to present a mathematical argument for its absence. A sophisticated computer program does not need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> colourings individually in order to eliminate all of them; nevertheless it is a very difficult computational task that existing software can only manage on small sizes. Each complete graph [...] has [...] edges, so there would be a total of [...] graphs to search through (for [...] colours) if brute force is used. Therefore, the complexity for searching all possible graphs (via brute force) is [...] for [...] colourings and an upper bound of [...] nodes.|$|E

2500|$|Moore-Bick {{is seen as}} aloof {{and lacking}} empathy; he {{concerned}} residents by suggesting only the technical causes of the fire would be investigated. Dent Coad said she still had less than “total confidence” in Moore-Bick, but “we {{have to work with}} the system we have, unfortunately.” Sources close to the inquiry suggest Moore-Bick is thinking of proposing an advisory panel. He is also inclined to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first stage investigating the immediate causes of the fire, the second investigating broader issues over a longer period. Dent Coad said there must be a legal commitment to a second stage. [...] "We need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the broader issues. One of the concerns about a two part inquiry – like with Hillsborough – is if it’s held off for too long and then it doesn’t happen at all, so that's a concern."
