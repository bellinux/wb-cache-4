500|$|It {{is claimed}} that Stoke Ramblers {{was formed in}} 1863 when former pupils of Charterhouse School formed a {{football}} club while they were apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-on-Trent. However, Stoke Ramblers' first documented match was five years later, on 17 October 1868, at the club's original home, the Victoria Cricket Club ground against E.W May's XV, the 15-a-side match ended in a 1–1 draw. [...] In the game, the club's first goal was scored by Henry Almond, Stoke's founder and captain. Stoke played four further fixtures in 1868, recording their first victory with a 2–0 win against Newcastle-under-Lyme. In 1875, to cope with rising attendances, the club switched to a ground at Sweetings Field, {{not far from the}} Victoria Cricket Ground. At this time, the only fixtures were friendly matches; this changed in 1877 when the Staffordshire Football Association was formed and created a new competition, the County Cup, which Stoke won in the inaugural season, beating <b>Talke</b> Rangers 1–0 in the final. In an earlier round, Stoke had recorded what is still the club's record victory, a 26–0 triumph over Mow Cop. Stoke retained the County Cup in the following season with a 2–1 win over Cobridge and established themselves as the largest club in the area.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five studies on empirical {{aspects of the}} market microstructure on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (StSE). The first study presents a stock pricing model which <b>talkes</b> trading and non-trading time effects into account. The model provides a framework for an empirical analysis of daily returns as well as trading/non-trading time returns of the OMX-index. The {{results show that the}} process generating the OMX-prices seems to be non-normal, discontinuous and serially correlated. Most noteworthy {{is the fact that the}} behaviour of the Monday returns appear to deviate from other weekday returns. The analysis shows that the OMX-index returns appear to be generated by a more complicated process than is usually assumed in e. g. conventional option pricing theory. In the second study, it is argued that the interplay between stock market participants and trading mechanisms gives rise to friction in the market prices. This makes the observed market prices differ from the intrinsic equilibrium values of the stocks. A model for explaining the process by which prices adjust towards their equilibrium values is presented. Accordingly the presence of friction causes the returns to be more volatile and serially correlated. The theoretical model is used to emphasise the persistence of the friction on an intradaily basis on the StSE. A set of data, comprised of OMX-prices obtained evay 15 th minute during the daily trading session, i used. Daily 24 -hour returns are calculated in different time intervals during the day: open-to-open, intraday-to-intraday and close-to-close. Evidence of different OMX-return generating distributions is found. In particular, the variances of the returns terminating at the beginning of the day are higher compared to the variances of the returns terminating during the middle and towards the end of the day. This implies that there is comparatively more noise in the pricing process just after the opening of the StSE. The third study investigates the profitability and riskiness of stock index arbitrage between the StSE and the OM. Transactions prices of standarised forward contracts, with the OMX-index as the underlying security, and minute-by-minute transactions prices as well as bid-ask quotes of the OMX-index are observed. Several deviations from the cost-of-carry relationship are reported. However, these arbitrage signals do not always give rise to realised profits. Instead, the specific structures of the stock and forward market impose restrictions on index arbitrage The results show that the size of an observed arbitrage signal appears to be a poor predictor of the actual outcome. The restrictions on index arbitrage, especially the settlement risk, are shown to make the strategies risky rather than riskless. The fourth study examines the effects of the extended trading session at the StSE. The variance of OMX-index stock returns is estimated over trading and non-trading time periods, as well as on a 24 -hour basis, before and after this event. The variances of the corresponding OMX-forward returns are also estimated and used as a benchmark. The results show that the ratio of trading/non-trading time return variances has increased. It is argued that this increase is due to the extended trading time period pes se, since the same phenomenon can not be observed at the forward market. Since the development of the overall 24 -hour variance appears to be unaffected by the extension, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that information is the main source behind the variance of stock returns and inconsistent with the idea that noise trading genrates some of the variance. The fifth study investigates the dynamic behaviour of trading and non-trading time conditional variance of the OMX-index stock and forward returns, using a dynamic GARCH specification. The results show that the conditional variance during both trading and non-trading time depend mainly on the return shocks eminating from trading time. Evidence of a leverage effect in the conditional variance is found during both trading and non-trading time. The study also investigate the effects on the GARCH specification of the trading time extension at the StSE. The extension of the trading hours has affected the relative levels of the unconditional index return variances for trading and non-trading time, but not their dynamic GARCH processes...|$|R

6000|$|Occasionally {{these letters}} give us {{interesting}} glimpses of persons and things in England. In {{the letter of}} Williams just cited, there is a lesson for all parties raised to power by exceptional causes. [...] "Surely, Sir, youre Father & {{all the people of}} God in England ... are now in the sadle & at the helme, so high that non datus descensus nisi cadendo: Some cheere up their spirits with the impossibilitie of another fall or turne, so doth Major G. Harrison ... a very gallant most deserving heavenly man, but most highflowne for the Kingdom of the Saints & the 5th Monarchie now risen & their sun never to set againe &c. Others, as, to my knowledge, the Protector ... are not so full of that faith of miracles, but still imagine changes & persecutions & the very slaughter of the witnesses before that glorious morning so much desired of a worldly Kingdome, if ever such a Kingdome (as literally it is by so many expounded) be to arise in this present world & dispensation." [...] Poor General Harrison lived {{to be one of the}} witnesses so slaughtered. The practical good sense of Cromwell is worth noting, the English understanding struggling against Judaic trammels. Williams gives us another peep through the keyhole of the past: [...] "It pleased the Lord to call me for some time & with some persons to practice the Hebrew, the Greeke, Latine, French & Dutch. The secretarie of the Councell (Mr Milton) for my Dutch I read him, read me many more languages. Grammar rules begin to be esteemed a Tyrannie. I taught 2 young Gentlemen, a Parliament man's sons, as we teach our children English, by words, phrazes, & constant <b>talke,</b> &c." [...] It is plain that Milton had talked over with Williams the theory put forth in his tract on Education, and made a convert of him. We could wish that the good Baptist had gone a little more into particulars. But which of us knows among the men he meets whom time will dignify by curtailing him of the [...] "Mr.," [...] and reducing him to a bare patronymic, as being a kind by himself? We have a glance or two at Oliver, who is always interesting. [...] "The late renowned Oliver confest to me in close discourse about the Protestants aifaires &c that he yet feard great persecutions to the protestants from the Romanists before the downfall of the Papacie," [...] writes Williams in 1660. This [...] "close discourse" [...] must have been six years before, when Williams was in England. Within a year after, Oliver interfered to some purpose in behalf of the Protestants of Piedmont, and Mr. Milton wrote his famous sonnet. Of the war with Spain, Williams reports from his letters out of England in 1656: [...] "This diversion against the Spaniard hath turnd the face & thoughts of many English, so that the saying now is, Crowne the Protector with gould,[138] though the sullen yet cry, Crowne him with thornes." ...|$|E
