50|$|The {{majority}} of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern {{is removed from}} a package, you can either cut the pattern based on the size you will be making or you can preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A tracing wheel is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric can then be cut to match the outlines on the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Vintage <b>patterns</b> may come with small holes pre-punched into the <b>pattern</b> <b>paper.</b> These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths {{to serve as a}} guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.|$|R
40|$|Joseph Campbell's classic work, The Hero With A Thousand Faces, {{traces the}} archetypal {{pattern of the}} hero from obscure origins, the call to adventure, the {{crossing}} of the threshold, encounter with dark forces, the winning of a boon, the re-crossing of the threshold, the re-entry of the ordinary world and the hero's re-integration with his community. The present <b>paper</b> <b>traces</b> this <b>pattern</b> in the Triliogy of Yaşar Kemal entitled The Other Face of the Mountain, following the hero Tashbash through the various phases of this archetypal-heroic journey.

50|$|<b>Tracing</b> <b>paper</b> {{is named}} as such {{for its ability}} for an image to be traced onto it. When <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is placed onto a picture, the picture is easily {{viewable}} through the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Pure cellulose fiber is translucent, {{and it is the}} air trapped between fibers, that makes paper opaque and looks white. If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting sheet will be translucent. Translucent papers are dense and contain up to 10% moisture at 50% humidity. This type of paper is roughly 25% lighter than regular paper.|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits {{the issue}} of intra-industry foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI). This issue was considered in Stephen Hymer's early work, but was not subsequently developed, and was largely ignored in the literature for some time. Using {{the example of the}} UK, this <b>paper</b> <b>traces</b> the <b>patterns</b> of intra-industry FDI, both across countries and industries, for both the manufacturing and service sectors. Despite the undoubted increase in the integration of goods and factor markets since the time of Hymer's writing, the analysis presented here shows that the pattern has changed little in the last 40 years. The paper then goes on to discuss the motives for intra-industry FDI, relating it to technology flows and factor cost differentials. Finally, we present some analysis relating intra-industry FDI to uneven development, both between developed and developing countries, and between regions of a developed country. It is clear that intra-industry FDI is still very much a developed country phenomenon, as Hymer suggested, with both developing countries and poorer regions of developed countries unlikely to reap any of the benefits. In this context, one-way and two-way FDI must be seen as different phenomena within the debate on globalisation. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Twelve paper patterns(9 kameez & 3 salwar) were {{standardized}} for pre adolescent girls. To {{study the}} opinion of the trainees regarding drafting and <b>paper</b> <b>pattern</b> technique, four trainings each of one-week duration in cutting and stitching of kameez-salwar for pre-adolescent girls were conducted. Two trainings were conducted in urban area and two in rural areas of Hisar. Opinion of trainees regarding <b>paper</b> <b>patterns</b> highlighted that with the use of <b>paper</b> <b>patterns,</b> trainees were able to stitch kameez-salwar independently at home. The trainees also opined that garment construction can be taken up as an income generating activity if <b>paper</b> <b>patterns</b> of different sizes are easily available. Majority of trainees had high opinion about <b>paper</b> <b>patterns</b> on the other hand 63. 33 % had low opinion about drafting technique because illiterate ladies with low educational level could not do calculations for drafting and taking body measurements was also a difficult task hence drafting of kameez-salwar could not be done properly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{proposed}} and experimentally demonstrated a cost-efficient and easy-to-fabricate flexible thin-film {{nanocrystal quantum dot}} (NCQD) photodetector, by sandwiching a piece of NCQD-soaked <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> between two PEDOT:PSS elec-trodes. The highly conductive and transparent multilayer poly-mer electrodes are printed with an office inkjet printer without further patterning on commercial unmodified transparency films. The <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is able to act as both the bed for NCQD attachment and the interspacing layer to prevent short-circuiting in vertical devices. Consistent increase in device performance is observed when the bending radius becomes smaller. Linear I–V characteristics are obtained, which show our device structure works as a photoconductor.

50|$|For {{traditional}} media (such as paint), {{the division}} between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for computer-generated art. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) {{to see how it}} would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.|$|R
