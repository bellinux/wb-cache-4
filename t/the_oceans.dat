5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E

5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt {{was released from}} volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. <b>The</b> <b>oceans</b> are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E

50|$|After {{the ice age}} <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> {{was about}} 150 meter higher in this area. <b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> {{stretched}} like a fjord passed Heddalsvatnet {{all the way to}} Hjartdal. The firs humans in central Telemark presumably travelled by boat deep inland along the fjords that are now gone. Post-glacial rebound eventually separated Heddalsvatnet from <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> {{and turned it into a}} freshwater lake. In neolithic times Heddalsvatnet was still a saltwater fjord connected to <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> and was separated from <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> around 1500 BC.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> {{formed when}} Pannotia disintegrated, Proto-Laurasia (Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia) rifted {{away from a}} supercontinent that would become Gondwana. Proto-Tethys formed between these two supercontinents. <b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> was bordered by Panthalassic <b>Ocean</b> to <b>the</b> north, {{separating}} it from Panthalassa by island arcs and Kazakhstania. The Proto-Tethys expanded during <b>the</b> Cambrian. <b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> was at its widest during the Late Ordovician to Middle Silurian. <b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> was situated between the Siberia to the west, and Gondwana to <b>the</b> east. <b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> began to shrink during the Late Silurian, when North China, and South China moved away from Gondwana and headed north. In the late Devonian, the microcontinent of Kazakhstania collided with Siberia, shrinking <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> even more. <b>The</b> <b>ocean</b> closed when <b>the</b> North China craton collided with Siberia-Kazakstania continent in the Carboniferous, while <b>the</b> Paleo-Tethys <b>Ocean</b> expanded.|$|R

5|$|At {{the global}} scale {{and in the}} {{broadest}} sense environmental management involves <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> freshwater systems, land and atmosphere, but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 1031 viruses on Earth. Most of them are bacteriophages, and most are in <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Microorganisms constitute more than 90 per cent of the biomass in the sea, {{and it has been}} estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 per cent of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life, and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine blue-green algae, and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth.|$|E
40|$|We {{think of}} <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> as {{being driven by}} a variety of forces: tides, wind, surface {{buoyancy}} fluxes associated with heating, cooling, evaporation, precipitation and ice formation, and geothermal heating. Apart from tidal forces, which act throughout <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> geothermal plumes that rise far into <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> interior, and locations of deep convection, these driving forces communicate their influence to <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> via boundary layers that are thin compared to <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> depth. In a sense, therefore, the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> is controlled by what happens in these boundary layers. The response of the boundary layers to forcing sets boundary conditions of fluid injection or removal that force a response in the rest of <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> We are familiar, for example, with the role of “Ekman suction ” as th...|$|R

5|$|Lithic peaks: a {{far smaller}} {{proportion}} of lithics (3,000 vs. 6,000 grains per gram) is observed in H3 and H6, {{which means that}} the role of the continents in providing sediments to <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> was relatively lower.|$|E
5|$|Normally, {{an ocean}} {{temperature}} of 26.5°C (79.7°F) spanning {{through at least}} a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone. These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. This value is well above 16.1°C (60.9°F), the global average surface temperature of <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oil spills are {{recorded}} both {{in case of}} maritime routes and pipeline routes to the main refineries. Oil spills, amounting {{to as much as}} 7.56 billion liters of oil entering <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> every year, occur due to damaged equipment or human error.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions.

5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E

50|$|Some {{of these}} lakes were salt after {{the ice age}} but later cut off from <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> during <b>the</b> post-glacial rebound.
