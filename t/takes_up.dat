40|$|Symbiotic Mnstigias from Eil Malk Jellyfish Lake and P&u lagoon <b>take</b> <b>up</b> {{and retain}} {{ammonium}} during both day and night. Uptake {{is due to}} symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae). Nitrate is not <b>taken</b> <b>up,</b> and is barely detectable in the environment. Nonsymbiotic Aurelia in the same lake excrete rather than <b>take</b> <b>up</b> ammonium. Mnstigias migrates vertically repeatedly at night, periodically visiting the nutrient-rich chemocline at about 15 m where, together with that <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> at ambient concentrations, the animals may <b>take</b> <b>up</b> enough ammonium to satisfy the total daily nitrogen requirement of their symbiotic algae. These observations are consistent With the hypothesis that repeated vertical migration by Mnstigias is a behavioral adaptation in the animal that facilitates nutrient acquisition by its algal symbionts. Reef corals which contain symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) can <b>take</b> <b>up,</b> retain, and recycle dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and thus minimize the loss of nitrogen from excretion. These features are viewed as adaptations for conserving nitrogen in characteristically nitrogenpoor tropical environments (e. g. Franziske...|$|R

5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk <b>takes</b> <b>up</b> 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk <b>takes</b> <b>up</b> about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments {{are most likely to be}} affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture <b>takes</b> <b>up</b> valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E

Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
