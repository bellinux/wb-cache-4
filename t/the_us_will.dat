5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>will</b> be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer {{asserts that}} China's rise {{will not be}} {{peaceful}} and that <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>will</b> seek to contain China and prevent it from achieving regional hegemony. He believes that China will attempt to dominate the Asia-Pacific region just as, he asserts, the U.S. set out to dominate the western hemisphere. The motivation for doing so would be to gain a position of overwhelming security and superiority against its neighbors which it sees as potential challengers to its status. Additionally, he maintains that <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>will</b> attempt to form a balancing coalition that consists primarily of India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia to counter the growing strength and power projection capabilities of China. He points to increased alliances and warming U.S.–Vietnam and U.S.–India relations as evidence of this.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} {{in the developing world}} have the problem of too few physicians.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>US</b> {{economic}} base starts at 150 BRPs, but besides the usual percentage growth process grows automatically by 10 BRP per turn, then 20 BRP per turn after entering the war, so by 1944-5 <b>the</b> <b>US</b> economy <b>will</b> {{have grown to}} colossal size. American SR and initial deployment capacity {{are linked to the}} size of her base, while her forcepool increases in three tranches, at annual intervals after the USA enters the war (so most of <b>the</b> <b>US</b> forces <b>will</b> not reach Europe until 1944). US involvement, before and after her formal entry into the war, is thus a gradual process.|$|R

25|$|August 27 - The United States Congress enacts the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act, which imposes {{much higher}} tariffs on sugar.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} responses of East Asian currencies to <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar depreciation {{in the near}} future.

Second, we show that the responses of the East Asian currencies to a sudden and sharp depreciation of <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar <b>will</b> differ with countries because of the different degree of linkages of the East Asian currencies to <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar. Based on the above analyses, a regional coordination of the exchange rate policy is necessary to the East Asian countries to response appropriately to a possible depreciation of <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar in <b>the</b> near future...|$|R
