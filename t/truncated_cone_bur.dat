40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of autoclave process on the stiffness properties of thermoplastic composite <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> made by automated fiber placement technique (AFP), two short <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were made out of advanced thermoplastic composite material (carbon fiber/PEEK). Then, the <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were tested by impulse excitation of vibration to get experimental natural frequencies. Tensile and compression test coupons were made {{out of the same}} material using hand layup and autoclave process, and stiffness properties were characterized experimentally. Furthermore, finite element analysis was performed to extract theoretical natural frequencies using material properties obtained from coupon testing. Comparison between the natural frequencies obtained using the finite element method and experimental modal analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the two <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were treated inside the autoclave, and changes in the thickness and density were measured. After autoclave treatment, experimental modal analysis was repeated {{to investigate the}} possible changes in natural frequencies. The finite element model was also updated upon the changes in thickness and density of the <b>truncated</b> <b>cones,</b> and consequently, comparison between the theoretical and experimental natural frequencies was carried out again. Also, micrographs of two <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were taken before and after autoclave treatment to examine the autoclave effect {{on the quality of the}} samples.

40|$|Surfaces of {{revolution}} belong {{to an important}} class of geometric models with simpler shape characteristics and useful geometric properties. In CAD and geometric modeling systems, solid models are often composed of planes and surfaces {{of revolution}}. Thus, {{it is important to}} develop efficient algorithms that compute the intersection of planes and surfaces of revolution and the intersection between two surfaces of revolution. Despite their importance, {{there seems to be a}} lack of reported work in this area. In this thesis, we propose two efficient algorithms to compute the intersection set: (1) planar sections of a surface of revolution and (2) the intersection between two surfaces of revolution. These algorithms first subdivide the i-th surface of revolution into a series of consecutive coaxial <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> Tij or revolute quadrics according to a user supplied error bound. Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the intersections between <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> and planes or revolute quadrics and planes. Our planar intersection algorithm detects intervals of consecutive <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> or revolute quadrics that contain non-empty intersections using a bounding volume tree. Then, it finds planar sections of each resulting <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> or revolute quadric that would intersect the plane. Finally joining them together into complete intersection curves. Our representations of complete intersection curves (piecewise conics, piecewise quadratic rational Bezier arcs, NURBS curves) facilitates 2 D operations on the intersection plane and generates 3 D points quickly on demand. We compare our representation with the exact planar intersection representation we derived. Our surface-surface intersection algorithm detects intervals of consecutive <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> that contain non-empty intersections using binary search. Then, for each <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> T 1 i within the valid intersection interval of the first revolution surface, we find the intersection curves Sij between T 1 i and all <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> T 2 j within the valid intersection interval of the other revolution surface. Finally, we join all Sij together into a complete curve representation which generates 3 D points quickly on demand...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{and body}} {{composition}} are indices of overall animal health and energetic balance {{and are often}} used as indicators of resource availability in the environment. This study used morphometric models and isotopic dilution techniques, two commonly used methods in the marine mammal field, to assess body composition of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, N = 111). Findings indicated that traditional morphometric models that use a series of circular, <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> to calculate marine mammal blubber volume and mass overestimated the animal’s measured body mass by 26. 961. 5 % SE. However, we developed a new morphometric model that uses elliptical <b>truncated</b> <b>cones,</b> and estimates mass with only 22. 861. 7 % error (N = 10). Because this elliptical <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> model can estimate body mass {{without the need for}} additional correction factors, {{it has the potential to}} be a broadly applicable method in marine mammal species. While using elliptical <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> yielded significantly smaller blubber mass estimates than circular cones (10. 260. 8 % difference; or 3. 560. 3 % total body mass), both <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> models significantly underestimated total body lipid content as compared to isotopic dilution results, suggesting that animals have substantial internal lipid stores (N = 76). Multiple linear regressions were used to determine the minimum number of morphometric measurements needed to reliably estimate animal mass and body composition so that future animal handling times could be reduced. Reduced models estimated body mass and lipid mass with reasonable accuracy using fewer than five morphometric measurements (root-mean-square-error: 4. 91 % for bod...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{experimental}} tests concerning scour phenomena {{have been carried out}} on a particular shape of the already effective circular piers in order to determine if any improvement is verified in their shape coefficient (with a corresponding decrease in scour). The circular pier foundation has been shaped as a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone,</b> partially or totally sunk into the mobile bed. In the experimental tests a preliminary comparison has been effected between scour at simple circular pier and non uniform piers with two different values of bevel angle β for the <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> foundation. Experimental results have showed that, for both values, the scour depth has been lower than that identified in experimental tests conducted on circular piers of the same diameter but without the <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> foundation. The reduction in scour detected in the tests with the <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> base {{can be attributed to the}} modification of the complex distribution of velocity within the scour, which is characterized by components that are vertical and transverse to the flow direction, with fluid involved in vortex movements (horseshoe-vortex and wake-vortex). The pressure field deriving from the presence of the pier results in gradients that tend to concentrate whirling thread and then release them as dissipating vortexes that essentially cause localized erosion. On passing the pier, the wake-vortex oscillates over time towards the sides: the non-uniform distribution of velocity then gives rise to vertical components. The <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> foundation spatially modifies the whirling phenomena of the horseshoe-vortex (especially the counter-vortex) which in this case partly occur on solid surfaces; moreover the <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> accompanies the fluid threads into the area where the horseshoe-vortex is shed: the different pattern of the hydrodynamic phenomenon on the one hand leads to a reduction in scour depth while, on the other, it creates a limited extension in the surface subject to erosion. In actual fact, the modification of vortex phenomena is evidenced by the different position for the onset of erosion. Hager and Oliveto (2005) pointed out that scour occurs around the pier in an area about 70 ° from the pier axis and then extends on the whole front section where the horseshoe-vortex is located. In the experimental tests conducted with the <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> foundations it was observed that scour originates in an area close to an angle from the channel axis ranging between 70 ° and 90 ° for the various geometries before extending all over the pier front. The early tests of comparison and the results obtained with the particular foundation shape of the studied pier (which can also be adapted to more complex foundation geometries, i. e. like the ones reported in the Manual of the State of Florida) show a favourable shape coefficient and suggest that the test schedule should be extended by including a larger number of diameters and varying the dynamic conditions of the stream flow, the height and angle β of the <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> base, and the duration of the tests...|$|R

30|$|One of the {{important}} aspects about the model is the consideration of a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> shaped CF [176 – 179]. Majority of the models we have encountered till now consider the CF as a symmetrical cylinder which {{is more of a}} simplifying assumption [91, 92]. This is because {{it has been shown that}} the CF can grow [39, 51, 55] from one end of either electrode to the other depending on the active electrode. So, it is quite possible that the CF in this case might not be a perfect cylinder. So, a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> is equipped to account for any variability and fluctuations arising due to the shape of the CF. Shapes other than simplified geometrical shapes are not considered in the models because of algebraic complexities. In previous models [91, 92], we noticed that device to device and cycle to cycle variability’s have a significant effect on the application of particular models to devices. So, by taking a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> as the CF shape provides this model more flexibility than the others.|$|R
