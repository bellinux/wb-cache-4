5|$|Adams {{considered}} {{writing a}} third radio series {{to be based}} on his novel Life, the Universe and Everything in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining Hitchhiker's Guide novels So Long, and <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> the Fish and Mostly Harmless. These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005.|$|E

25|$|A sequel, The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, was {{published}} a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since So Long, and <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> the Fish.

25|$|In So Long, and <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> the Fish (published in 1984), Arthur {{returns home}} to Earth, rather {{surprisingly}} {{since it was}} destroyed when he left. He meets and {{falls in love with}} a girl named Fenchurch, and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about it all before expiring.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptation}} of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series {{in comparison to the}} second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in a different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly Harmless are now foreshadowed in the {{adaptation of}} So Long and <b>Thanks</b> <b>For</b> <b>All</b> The Fish, while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase. While Mostly Harmless originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.|$|E
50|$|Anthony, wearily, bids Vincent farewell. Vincent <b>thanks</b> Anthony <b>for</b> <b>all</b> {{his efforts}} and the comfort Vincent has taken from Anthony's counsels. Vincent {{says he will}} write down what was {{discussed}} in Hungarian and German. Anthony ends by praying that God will breathe His Holy Spirit into the reader's breast, so that he may teach the reader inwardly in his heart. Anthony then prays that God will reunite them once more either here or in Heaven(XXVII).|$|R

25|$|In 1992, Kevin Davies {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a documentary entitled The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Davies had previously worked on the stage show at the Rainbow Theatre, and, while working for Pierce Animation Studios in 1980, had introduced Alan Bell to Rod Lord, leading to the animation for the TV series. For the documentary, Davies used many photographs and home movies he shot during the 1980 production of the series and recorded new interviews in October 1992 with the cast and crew. New footage of Simon Jones, David Dixon and Michael Cule, in character, were shot at the farm in Sussex used as Arthur Dent's house, and incorporated into the documentary with some references to So Long, and <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> the Fish, such as Arthur finding his home intact, and placing his (animated) Babel fish into a goldfish bowl. BBC video released the sixty-minute documentary on VHS in 1993. Footage {{not included in the}} original documentary was included in the 2002 DVD release of the series. The documentary itself has not (as of 2005) been transmitted on TV.|$|E

Jackson autographed a picture of himself and his niece Nicole for Barbera with the words: [...] "To my hero of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, with many <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the many cartoon friends you gave me as a child. They were all I had. – Michael" ...|$|E
500|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have appeared}} in novels. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy {{and one of its}} sequels, So Long, and <b>Thanks</b> <b>For</b> <b>All</b> the Fish, the dolphins try to warn humans of Earth's impending destruction, but their behavior was misinterpreted as playful acrobatics. Bottlenose dolphins are central to David Brin's series of Uplift Universe novels, particularly Startide Rising, where they are one of the four Earth species (along with chimpanzees, gorillas, and dogs) to have been 'uplifted' to sentience. Bottlenose dolphins are primary characters in Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, especially The Dolphins of Pern. Bottlenose dolphins are incorporated into the science fiction video game series Ecco the Dolphin. Delphineus, a dolphin, is featured in the video game , helping the boy, Adam, to find the sea king Cetus (a sperm whale), as well as assisting in cleaning up the underwater environment where he lives. [...] Bottlenose dolphins were mentioned in various Star Trek novels and other materials as serving as navigation specialists on board various Federation starships.|$|E
