25|$|Rita Gross states, {{that the}} view of Parvati only as ideal wife and mother is {{incomplete}} symbolism {{of the power of}} the feminine in mythology of India. Parvati, along with other goddesses, are involved with <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>range</b> of culturally valued goals and activities. Her connection with motherhood and female sexuality does not confine the feminine or exhaust their significance and activities in Hindu literature. She is balanced by Durga, who is strong and capable without compromising her femaleness. She manifests in every activity, from water to mountains, from arts to inspiring warriors, from agriculture to dance. Parvati's numerous aspects, states Gross, reflects the Hindu belief that the feminine has universal range of activities, and her gender is not a limiting condition.|$|E

25|$|The time {{resolution}} needed depends on brain processing time for various events. An example of <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>range</b> here {{is given by}} the visual processing system. What the eye sees is registered on the photoreceptors of the retina within a millisecond or so. These signals get to the primary visual cortex via the thalamus in tens of milliseconds. Neuronal activity related to the act of seeing lasts for more than 100ms. A fast reaction, such as swerving to avoid a car crash, takes around 200ms. By about half-a-second, awareness and reflection of the incident sets in. Remembering a similar event may take a few seconds, and emotional or physiological changes such as fear arousal may last minutes or hours. Learned changes, such as recognizing faces or scenes, may last days, months, or years. Most fMRI experiments study brain processes lasting a few seconds, with the study conducted over some tens of minutes. Subjects may move their heads during that time, and this head motion needs to be corrected for. So does drift in the baseline signal over time. Boredom and learning may modify both subject behavior and cognitive processes.|$|E

500|$|Within {{weeks the}} Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C.

Three huge new commands were created by Executive Order Number 9082 of 28 February 1942, [...] "Reorganizing the Army and the War Department": the Army Air Forces under Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the Army Ground Forces under Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair and the Services of Supply, under Somervell. As such, he was not only promoted to the rank of lieutenant general over the heads of many more senior officers, but some of them, including Reybold, now found themselves his subordinates. He was answerable to two men: Marshall, and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Somervell built up a good working relationship with both. Senator Harry S. Truman of the Truman Committee disapproved of Somervell's cost overruns, declaring: [...] "I will say this for General Somervell, he will get the stuff, but it is going to be hell on the taxpayer. He has a WPA attitude on the expenditure of money." [...] The Services of Supply were renamed the Army Service Forces in March 1943, as the term [...] "supply" [...] was felt to be too narrow a description of <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>range</b> of logistic activities carried out by the organization.
