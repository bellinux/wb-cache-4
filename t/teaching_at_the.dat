5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience {{gave him a}} sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E

His death, from a single gunshot while in his home, remains an unsolved mystery.|$|E
5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{university}} ebbed {{in his final}} years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have}} a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
