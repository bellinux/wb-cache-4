The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently, banking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{regulated}} activities in the world, because banks are the most important institutional units engaged in financial intermediation and affects not only the whole national eco-nomy of the country, but the global financial market as well. One of the key components of banking regulation are requirements expected for the bank capital, which prevent the bank from various unforeseen risks incurring substantial losses and are a sort of guarantee to maintain the financial system stability. For this reason, it is useful to find out what factors affect <b>the</b> capital <b>adequacy</b> ratio, and what measures the banks are going to take in order to meet the new capital requirements. The present research reveals the options of the implemen-tation of the new system and the main problems faced by banks. The paper consists of four main parts: review of theory and literature, the research methodology of the factors influencing <b>the</b> capital <b>adequacy,</b> <b>the</b> study of factors influencing <b>the</b> capital <b>adequacy</b> ratio, and <b>the</b> capital <b>adequacy</b> management problem areas accor-ding to the Basel III requirements and conclusions.
