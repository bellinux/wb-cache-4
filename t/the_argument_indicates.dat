40|$|The {{revelation of}} God – a rhetorical-critical {{interpretation}} of Romans 1 : 18 - 32 M. A. Kruger’s 1983 doctoral thesis caused serious discussion in GKSA circles {{with regard to}} the differentiation between “general revelation” and “specific revelation”. Romans 1 : 18 - 32 seems to be a central pericope in the understanding of the revelation of God. A project of the Faculty of Theology, PU for CHE, focusing on this specific problem, gave birth to this article as a component of the interpretation of this pericope. The issue addressed in this article is how this pericope can be interpreted from a rhetorical-critical point of view. In my own interdisciplinary and interactional approach to rhetorical criticism, the purpose is to interpret the communicative function(s) of this pericope. It turns out that the letter to the Romans was addressed to those in Rome in order to convince them that the reason for their acceptance as God’s people lies in God’s work only and not in their imitation of the Jews. Romans 1 : 18 - 32 seems {{to be part of the}} opening of the letter body intended to be a warning for all people, including an example of what may happen if this warning is not taken seriously.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{existence}} of a minimum interval of space and time may imply the existence of gravity as a geometric property of spacetime described by general relativity. The origin of gravity is still a controversial issue. The solution of this problem may have important implications for a complete theory of quantum gravity. On the other hand, independent of the nature of gravity, the existence of a minimum interval of space and time has been widely argued and acknowledged as a model-independent result of the proper combination of quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR) (see, e. g. [1] for a review). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>indicates</b> that the minimum time interval and the minimum length are of the order of Planck time (PT) and Planck length (PL), respectively. The model-independence of the argument strongly suggests that discreteness is probably a more basic feature of spacetime, and it may have a firmer basis beyond QM and GR 1, which are still based on continuous spacetime. Therefore, it may be appropriate to re-examine the relationship between the discreteness of spacetime and the existing fundamental theories from the opposite direction. In this essay, we will analyze the possible implications of spacetime discreteness for the origin of gravity. Since the formulations and meanings of discrete spacetime are different in existing theories and arguments, we only resort to its minimum explanation here, namely that spacetime is not infinitely divisible, and a spacetime interval shorter than the minimum interval of spacetime (i. e. the Planck scale) is physically meaningless. For example, the localization length of a pointlike particle should be not shorter than the minimum length. According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in QM we have p x Δ≥Δ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} civil society and democracy through {{a case study of}} the revival of the Catholic Church in the post-communist Czech Republic. I use an ideal typical conception of civic organisations that emphasises three characteristics: civility, independence, and autonomy. I ask how each of these characteristics is related to democracy and how {{the degree to which the}} Czech Catholic Church approximates each characteristic can be explained. Civility - my research challenges the contemporary consensus around the work of Robert Putnam that there is an inverse relationship between civility and associational hierarchy. I show how the organisations and networks in which the Bishops were involved during Communism functioned as schools of democracy, producing the strong civil values of Czech Bishops still in evidence today. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>indicates</b> that Putnam and other social capital theorists should move beyond the formal level of associations in their search for the causes of civic virtue. Independence - The failure of the church to restitute its property and its continued dependence on the Czech state is conventionally explained by reference to either an historic anti-Catholicism or the contemporary exigencies of justice. I reject these arguments, and show how Church restitution is artificially created as an issue by politicians seeking to build distinct party identities in the difficult circumstances of a society still awaiting the consolidation of new social cleavages. Autonomy - the Church's weak links to the public sphere are generally explained by reference to a communist legacy of anti-political attitudes, or to poor political skills on the part of civic associations. Instead, I argue that the strongest explanatory factor lies with the political programme of the Klaus administration and its post-communist inspired concerns to limit power to the Parliament, and more particularly to the executive, where Klaus' party was dominant. 1 show how Klaus' success was greatly facilitated by the speed of the 'transition', which allowed the easy implementation of a radical ideology by a political entrepreneur who faced little opposition from parliamentary colleagues unable to find 'partners' in a post-Communist atomised society...|$|E

40|$|David Strauss’s Das Leben Jesu (1835) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} and controversial theological works of the nineteenth century. It was first translated into English by Mary Ann Evans (“George Eliot”) in 1860, and is said to have been an important early influence on Friedrich Nietzsche. Strauss (1808 - 1874) applied the methods of German “higher criticism” or textual criticism to the Gospels, and argued that their accounts of Jesus’ miracles and prophecies were to be understood “mythically”—as products of the early church 2 ̆ 7 s use of Jewish messianic ideas and expectations to underscore the conviction that Jesus was the Messiah. Parker’s long (20, 000 words) review recaps Strauss’s arguments regarding the birth, genealogy, career, and miracles of Jesus, and places Strauss’s work in the context of German and English theology and philosophy. He writes: “It is not our aim to write a polemic against the author of the “Life of Jesus,” but to describe his book or “define his position,” as the politicians are wont to say. The work in question comprises, first, an Introduction, relating to the formation of “the Mythical stand-point,” from which the Evangelical history is to be contemplated; second, the main work itself, which is divided into three books, relating respectively to the History of the Birth and Childhood of Jesus; his Public Life; his Sufferings, Death, and Resurrection; third, a conclusion of the whole book, or the doctrinal significance of the life of Jesus. … [A] more descriptive title would be, A Fundamental Criticism on the Four Gospels; … it is not a history, but a criticism and collection of materials, out of which a conjectural history may be constructed. … The general manner of treating the subject, and arranging the chapters, sections, and parts of <b>the</b> <b>argument,</b> <b>indicates</b> consummate dialectical skill; while the style is clear, the expression direct, and the author’s openness in referring to his sources of information, and stating his conclusions in all their simplicity, is candid and exemplary. ” While Parker does take issue with the “presuppositions” with which Strauss approached his materials, he nonetheless concludes: “The wonderful ability with which it is written, the learning, so various and exact, wherewith it is stored, are surprising in any one, but truly extraordinary in so juvenile an author; born 1808. For our own part, we rejoice that the book has been written, though it contains much that we cannot accept. May the evil it produces soon end! But the good it does must last forever. To estimate it aright, we must see more than a negative work in its negations. Mr. Strauss has plainly asked the question, ‘What are the historical facts that lie at the basis of the Christian movement?’ Had he written with half this ability, and with no manner of fairness, in defence of some popular dogma of his sect, and against freedom of thought and reason, no praise would have been too great to bestow upon him. ” Controversies over the literal-historical status of the miracles and prophecies of the New Testament played an important role in the evolution of Unitarianism and Transcendentalism. Parker’s review brought the European debate into American homes and pulpits and was an important factor in the development of liberal theology in New England...|$|E

This condition can be satisfied with Hawking-Unruh mechanism.
