5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E

5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster {{that can take}} a high polish, and which is so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|E
5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> had any military utility. Robert Redhead, the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because {{of the strength of}} local feeling.|$|E
5|$|While {{the league}} struggled, the Grey Cup game itself {{retained}} its popularity and remained a national institution. The {{strength of the}} contest allowed the league to endure its challenges. The CFL survived into 1997 and was buoyed by a new television deal with The Sports Network which, along with the launch of its popular Friday Night Football program, has been credited with saving the league. That year's Grey Cup, held in Edmonton and won by Toronto, drew nearly 22,000 more fans than the previous year. The CFL restored its reputation over time, enjoying new popularity into the 2000s such <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{had to rely on}} an exciting Grey Cup final to achieve stability for the next season.|$|E

5|$|The {{costs of}} salvage, clean-up, and {{compensation}} {{are believed to}} have totalled around US$120 million. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid by insurance companies and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened the terminal and a feasibility study in 1985 showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used the terminal (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic oil reserve. Initially, oil movement to and from the terminal was carried out by road. In 1990, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf war, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker to offload at the terminal on a one-off basis. In 1996, an unloading buoy was installed and this has been used since that time.|$|E

5|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the EU. This was supported by the Labor Party and the right-winged Conservative Party and Progress Party. The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be deregulated from 1 January 1993, with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July. Full, domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997. SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997, which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines, rather than these two, until then. SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993, while Braathens SAFE stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> was in favor of competition, despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company's history. The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes, that were being cross-subsidized, being closed. SAS stated that with competition, prices would fall 20–30%, and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, No.1 SFTS came {{under the control of}} Southern Area Command, {{headquartered}} in Melbourne. The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, Avro Ansons, Hawker Demons, and a deHavilland Tiger Moth. Group Captain John McCauley served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander Roy King, who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October. As of July, No.1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including Gipsy Moths, deHavilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides, Douglas C-47 Dakotas, CAC Wirraways and Airspeed Oxfords, the last two being the mainstays. In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed No.1 Training Group. By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets. It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School. Wing Commander Charles Read held command of No.1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated. Among these were Nicky Barr, who became one of Australia's leading fighter aces in North Africa, and Bill Newton, awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30June numbered 3,000 Australians.|$|E
5|$|No.1 EFTS {{relocated}} to Tamworth, New South Wales, during 17–28May 1944, reportedly {{to allow for}} the expansion of civil aviation at Parafield. Training units in New South Wales came under the control of No.2 (Training) Group. On 10September, a student was killed when his Tiger Moth crashed south of Tamworth aerodrome. All flying training at No.1 EFTS came to an end on 15September, by which time a total of 1,991 students had passed through the school. Pilots still undergoing instruction were posted to No.8 Elementary Flying School at Narrendera, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required EATS graduates for the war in Europe.

No.1 EFTS was officially disbanded on 12December 1944. Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Tamworth was formed the same day, utilising some of No.1 EFTS's staff. It was one of many CMUs that the RAAF raised for the storage and upkeep of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal after the war. CMU Tamworth was disbanded on 5July 1947.|$|E
