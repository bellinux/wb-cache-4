40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{the effects of}} avenues of trees in urban street canyons on <b>traffic</b> pollutant <b>dispersion.</b> We describe various wind-tunnel experiments with different tree-avenue models in combination with variations in street-canyon aspect ratio W/H (with W the street-canyon width and H the building height) and approaching wind direction. Compared to tree-free street canyons, in general, higher pollutant concentrations are found. Avenues of trees do not suppress canyon vortices, although the air ventilation in canyons is hindered significantly. For a perpendicular wind direction, increases in wall-average and wall-maximum concentrations at the leeward canyon wall and decreases in wall-average concentrations at the windward wall are found. For oblique and perpendicular wind directions, increases at both canyon walls are obtained. The strongest effects of avenues of trees on <b>traffic</b> pollutant <b>dispersion</b> are observed for oblique wind directions for which also the largest concentrations at the canyon walls are found. Thus, the prevailing assumption that attributes the most harmful dispersion conditions to a perpendicular wind direction does not hold for street canyons with avenues of trees.

The traffic and rainfall intensity data were collected by a selected video traffic detector and its nearest rainfall station in Hong Kong, respectively. The coefficient of variation of speed (CVS) was employed to measure the vehicular <b>traffic</b> speed <b>dispersion.</b> The analysis shows that the empirical values of CVS typically range from 0. 05 to 0. 2 at different traffic densities and rainfall intensities, and the exponential function provides a good fit to traffic speed data under both dry and rain conditions.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{bandwidth}} allocation and routing in Virtual Path (VP) based Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks was studied. As an {{efficient way to}} facilitate the network management, VP concept has been proposed in the literature. Traffic control and resource management are simplified in VP based networks. However, a priori reservation of resources for VP 2 ̆ 7 s also reduces the statistical multiplexing gain, resulting in increased Call Blocking Probability (CBP);The focus of this study is on how to reduce CBP (or equivalently, how to improve the bandwidth utilization for a given CBP requirement) by the effective bandwidth allocation and routing algorithms. Equivalent capacity concept was used to calculate the required bandwidth by the call. Each call was represented as a bursty and heterogeneous multimedia traffic;First, the effect of <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion</b> was explored to achieve more statistical gain. Through this study, it was discovered how the effect of <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion</b> varies with different traffic characteristics and the number of paths. An efficient routing algorithm, CED, was designed. Since <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion</b> requires resequencing and extra signaling to set up multiple VC 2 ̆ 7 s, it should be used only when it gives significant benefits. This was the basic idea in our design of CED. The algorithm finds an optimal dispersion factor for a call, where the gain balances the dispersion cost. Simulation study showed that the CBP can be significantly reduced by CED;Next, this study provides analysis of the statistical behavior of the traffic seen by individual VP, as a result of <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion.</b> This analysis is essential in estimating the required capacity of a VP accurately when both multimedia traffic and <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion</b> are taken into account. Then analytical models have been formulated. The cost effective design and engineering of VP networks requires accurate and tractable mathematical models which capture the important statistical properties of traffic. This study also revealed that the load distribution estimated by equivalent capacity follows Gaussian distribution which is the sum of two jointly Gaussian random variables. For the analysis of load distribution when CED is used, we simplified multiple paths as identical paths using the idea of Approximation by Single Abstract Path (ASAP), and approximated the characteristics of the traffic seen by individual VP.

40|$|This paper investigates two {{strategies}} {{to reduce the}} communication delay in future wireless networks: <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion</b> and network densification. A hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance. For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i. e., {{the probability that the}} delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in terms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival traffic for mmWave systems, the effective capacity, i. e., the service capability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The derived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated through simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given average system gain, <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion,</b> network densification, and the hybrid scheme exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For instance, <b>traffic</b> <b>dispersion</b> outperforms network densification, given high average system gain and arrival rate, while it could be the worst option, otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the performance gain is related to the arrival rate and average system gain, jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize the delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and system service capability...|$|E

And then the patterns of flow and dispersion within three different kinds of street canyon configuration under the perpendicular approaching flow were numerically studied. The result showed that the width and height of building can dramatically affect the pollution level inside the street canyon. As the width or height of building increases, the pollution at the pedestrian level increases. And the asymmetric configuration (step-up or step-down street canyon) could provide better ventilation.

An individual 2 ̆ 7 s exposure experience is greatly influenced by where they live as emission concentrations are much higher closer to roads. A systematic review was conducted using the MOOSE guidelines in order to synthesise studies published 1989 - 2009 which investigated pregnancy outcomes in relation to residential exposure to traffic emissions. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were consequently reviewed. We identified exposure assessment methods and the scope of health endpoints that have been investigated.

40|$|Binary {{decisions}} of agents coupled in networks {{can often be}} classified into two types: “coordination,” where an agent takes an action if enough neighbors are using that action, as in the spread of social norms, innovations, and viral epidemics, and “anticoordination,” where too many neighbors taking a particular action causes an agent to take the opposite action, as in <b>traffic</b> congestion, crowd <b>dispersion,</b> and division of labor. Both of these cases can be modeled using linear-threshold–based dynamics, and a fundamental {{question is whether the}} individuals in such networks are likely to reach decisions with which they are satisfied.

This holds for every network topology and every distribution of thresholds, for both asynchronous and partially synchronous decision-making updates. These results reveal that irregular network topology, population heterogeneity, and partial synchrony are not sufficient to cause cycles or nonconvergence in linear-threshold dynamics; rather, other factors such as imitation or the coexistence of coordinating and anticoordinating agents must play a role...|$|R
