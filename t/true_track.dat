30|$|Tracks are {{initialized}} {{and updated}} using the measurements obtained in each scan. Track initialization in a cluttered environment results in both <b>true</b> <b>tracks</b> and false <b>tracks.</b> <b>True</b> <b>tracks</b> always follow the target measurements, whereas false tracks {{do not follow}} the target measurements. A technique called false track discrimination (FTD) is used to confirm the <b>true</b> <b>tracks</b> and terminate the false tracks. Almost all target-tracking algorithms employ track quality measures to achieve FTD. But the standard probabilistic data association (PDA) [1] {{does not provide a}} track quality measure for FTD. The multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) [2] uses a sequential probability ratio as a track quality measure for FTD. In [3], the authors proposed a track-oriented MHT algorithm and applied a smoothing velocity vector for reduction of the false track establishment.|$|R

It is specifically oriented towards solving the combinatorial problems in multitarget tracking. In Part 3, analytical derivations are presented for quantitatively assessing, a priori, the performance of a track-while-scan radar system (<b>true</b> <b>track</b> initiation, false track initiation, <b>true</b> <b>track</b> continuation and false track deletion characteristics).

50|$|Note {{that there}} are some non-powered tracked {{transports}} (i.e. trailers that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a drive sprocket. There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, Tucker Sno-cat and Mattracks rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks {{in the shape of a}} triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the drive sprocket at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one drive sprocket (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-axle truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic half-track system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on <b>true</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} make radar target track {{simulation}} more realistic in simulation test-bed of C 3 I system, a new method which utilizes data mining techniques based on historical radar data is proposed. This method includes two stages: The first is “filtering separation - piecewise fitting - feature clustering". In this stage, the radar historical data is divided into the actual <b>true</b> <b>track</b> and noise. Through computing the second-order discrete curvature, the actual <b>true</b> <b>track</b> is decomposed into several segments, such as straight line and arc, which are fitted with multinomial subsequently. On this basis, after analyzing the characteristic vector of radar historical data, the clustering database can be established; the second is “feature association-track recombination”. The track in pre-deigned air scenario is segmented by the second-order discrete curvature. After the correlative feature information of the segmented scenario is searched, matched and associated with the information in clustering database, a new track will be restructured by using this output results.

30|$|The core {{objective}} for {{the remote}} sensing target localization and tracking is to generate target state estimates using measurements processed by the sensors, {{such as the}} radar [1 – 3]. The measurements can originate from targets or from clutter and lead to both true tracks (following the targets) and false tracks (following the clutter) existing in the surveillance area. Therefore, false track discrimination [4], involving <b>true</b> <b>track</b> confirmation and false track termination, is crucial for tracking algorithms.
