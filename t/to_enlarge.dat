5|$|Due to {{his having}} overtly {{undermined}} the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately {{upon his return}} from Germany. However, despite high hopes {{on the part of}} the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in the St. Lawrence river, and <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E

5|$|With its oak {{panels and}} other decor recalling an earlier time, {{the heyday of}} cabaret, the Oak Room was small, intimate, and {{expensive}} (at least $100 per person, more if one had dinner, except for matinees), and was not a big moneymaker for the Algonquin. Part of the space occupied by the former Oak Room was used <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the Blue Bar, the rest was converted into a private breakfast room for Marriott Reward Elite customers.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> {{the village to}} house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E

Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. She believed that women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{ended in}} 11th place overall, {{receiving}} 6,555 votes nationwide out of over 125 million cast. He thus missed, {{by a large}} margin, the 5 percent needed to qualify the Socialist Party USA for federally distributed public funding in the next election. His best showings were in Tennessee, where he received 1,326 votes out of over 2 million votes cast, and in Ohio, where he managed to receive 2,731 votes. His weakest showings were in Kentucky and Minnesota, where he managed to gain 7 votes in each state. Moore was not able <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the party's voter base, but instead the voter base shrunk by over 4 thousand votes nationwide from the previous election fronted by Walt Brown.|$|E
5|$|Renovations {{included}} {{adding a}} new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand quarried stone from the walls <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> a window opening. The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and {{to comply with the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.|$|E

5|$|The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary {{was founded}} in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, south of Rochester. In 1850, it was {{resolved}} <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming Genesee College. However, the location was soon thought {{by many to be}} insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support.|$|E
5|$|The main portion (the center) {{contains}} the entrance, facing west. To its {{left is the}} chapel and to its right is the schoolroom. Both rooms originally were smaller, with bedrooms located {{at the ends of}} building, but a 1910 restoration eliminated those walls <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the rooms. Two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen (which was added at a later date), and the servants' dining room are in the north wing, while the south wing has three bedrooms and the family dining room. The house is topped by a cupola from which bullfights and festivals in the adjacent plaza could be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.|$|E

5|$|While still {{partnered with}} his brother, McNary began {{teaching}} property law at Willamette University College of Law {{in the spring}} of 1899 and courting Jessie Breyman. In 1908, he was hired as its dean to replace John W. Reynolds. As dean, he worked <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the school and secure additional classroom space. He recruited prominent local attorneys to serve on the faculty and increased the size of the school from four graduates in 1908 to 36 in 1913, his last year as dean. In his drive to make Willamette's law school one of the top programs on the West Coast, he had it re-located from leased space in office buildings to the university campus.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} mockup {{was completed in}} June 1945 by Factory No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for static load testing. This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to be reinforced, and the opportunity was taken <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|From the Communist perspective, {{even though}} South Vietnam {{was plagued by}} {{political}} instability, it still had a strong army to resist the Viet Cong. So shortly after the Binh Gia campaign, North Vietnamese leaders reached a resolution to launch a summer offensive, to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military. During {{the early stages of}} the Communist summer campaign, Viet Cong forces in Quảng Ngãi Province successfully destroyed a South Vietnamese task force, led by the ARVN 51st Infantry Regiment, in the village of Ba Gia. Following their victory at Ba Gia, the National Liberation Front (known in America as Viet Cong) turned its attention to the Mekong Delta region. To prepare for their next offensive, Major-General Le Trong Tan was given the task of directing Viet Cong military operations in the provinces of Phước Long, Bình Phước. For the first time, the newly created Viet Cong 273rd and 274th Regiments was ordered to join the 271st and 272nd Regiments on the battlefield; their objective was to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military, and eliminate the strategic hamlets <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> what North Vietnam viewed as 'liberated zones'.|$|E
