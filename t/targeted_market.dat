50|$|However, {{there are}} several {{disadvantages}} that {{can be associated with}} <b>Target</b> <b>Marketing.</b> Firstly, finding your <b>Target</b> <b>Market</b> is expensive. Often businesses conduct primary research to find whom their <b>Target</b> <b>Market</b> is, which usually involves hiring a research agency, which can cost “tens of thousands of dollars” (Suttle, R. 2016). Finding ones <b>Target</b> <b>Market</b> is also time-consuming, as it often “requires a considerable amount of time to identify a target audience” (Suttle, R. 2016). Also focusing on finding your <b>Target</b> <b>Market</b> can make you overlook other customers that are interested in your product. Businesses/ Individuals may find that their ‘average customer’ might not include those that fall just outside of the average customers “demographics” (Suttle, R. 2016), which will limit the sale of their products. The last disadvantage to note is the ethical ramifications that are associated with <b>Target</b> <b>Marketing.</b> An example of this would be a “beer company that may target less educated, poorer people with larger-sized bottles” (Suttle, R. 2016).|$|R

50|$|Target Market Share: Based on {{the above}} analysis, it is {{possible}} to arrive at the overall market size for the assessment period, and thereby decide on the volume of business the firm targets to achieve during the period.

50|$|Product {{management}} {{is crucial to}} a high market penetration in the <b>targeted</b> <b>market</b> and by {{improving the quality of}} products, businesses are able to attract and out-quality the competitors' products to match customers' requirements and eventually lead to more sales made.

40|$|Businesses {{may not be}} in a {{position}} to satisfy all of their customers, every time. It may prove difficult to meet the exact requirements of each individual customer. People do not have identical preferences, so rarely does one product completely satisfy everyone. Many companies may usually adopt a strategy that is known as <b>target</b> <b>marketing.</b> This strategy involves dividing the market into segments and developing products or services to these segments. A <b>target</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy is focused on the customers’ needs and wants. Hence, a prerequisite for the development of this customer-centric strategy is the specification of the <b>target</b> <b>markets</b> that the companies will attempt to serve. The marketing managers who may consider using <b>target</b> <b>marketing</b> will usually break the market down into groups and to target the most profitable segments. They may adapt their marketing mix elements, including; products, prices, channels, and promotional tactics to suit the requirements of individual consumers. In sum, this chapter explains the three stages of <b>target</b> <b>marketing,</b> including; market segmentation (ii) <b>market</b> <b>targeting</b> and (iii) <b>market</b> positioning. peer-reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Market {{penetration}} {{is a way}} {{to determine}} successfulness of the business model and marketing strategy for a product.
