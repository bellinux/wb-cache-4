40|$|The {{literature}} on team cooperation has neglected {{the effects of}} relative kindness intention on cooperation, which we measure by comparing the kindness intentions of an agent to her group members to the kindness shown by other members to this same agent. We argue that the agent's emotional reaction to material payoff inequity is not constant, but rather affected by her relative kindness intention. Then, we apply the model to team projects with multiple partners and investigate how inequity-aversion and relative kindness intention jointly influence team cooperation. We first {{consider the case of}} homogeneous agents, where their marginal productivity levels and <b>technical</b> <b>capacities</b> are the same, and then consider the case of heterogeneous agents, where their marginal productivity levels and <b>technical</b> <b>capacities</b> are not the same. Our results show that inequity-aversion has no effect on effort expenditure in the former case, but does affect it in the latter case. The consideration of relative kindness intention may impact the agents' optimal cooperative effort expenditure when their <b>technical</b> <b>capacities</b> are different. In addition, it is beneficial for team cooperation, and might not only reduce the negative impact but also enhance the positive impact of inequity-aversion on the agents' effort expenditures...|$|R

25|$|The Government of Argentina (GoA) with World Bank {{assistance}} has {{aimed to}} reduce industrial wastewater discharge (organic {{as well as}} toxic effluents) that directly enter the MR River. Over the next 15–20 years these efforts {{will contribute to the}} environmental recovery of the river. They will focus on the 50 main industrial polluters that contribute ~95% of the total industrial organic load (approximately 70 percent of the total organic load) discharged to the MR River and a further 170 industries with the highest toxic load currently discharged into the MR River. A combination of technical assistance to improve monitoring, control, and enforcement by the MR Basin Authority will be instituted. The idea is to help in collecting baseline data and carry out diagnostic exercises. Support will be provided for private sector investments in pollution control and cleaner production processes, targeting small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) that typically pollute more per unit of output and have weaker financial and <b>technical</b> <b>capacity</b> to comply with environmental regulations.|$|E
2500|$|An Involved {{society is}} a highly {{advanced}} group that has achieved galaxy-wide involvement with other cultures or societies. There are a few dozen Involved societies and {{hundreds or thousands of}} well-developed (interstellar) but insufficiently influential societies or cultures; there are also well-developed societies known as [...] "galactically mature" [...] which do not take a dynamic role in the galaxy as a whole. In the novels, the Culture might be considered the premier Involved society, or at least the most dynamic and energetic, especially given that the Culture itself is a growing multicultural fusion of Involved societies. The Involved are contrasted with the Sublimed, groups that have reached a high level of technical development and galactic influence but subsequently abandoned physical reality, ceasing to take serious interventionist interest in galactic civilization. They are also contrasted with what some Culture people loosely refer to as [...] "barbarians", societies of intelligent beings which lack the <b>technical</b> <b>capacity</b> to know about or take a serious role in their interstellar neighbourhood. There are also the elder civilisations, which are civilizations that reached the required level of technology for sublimation, but chose not to, and have retreated from the larger galactic meta-civilization.|$|E
