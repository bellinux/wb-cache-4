Medication labels contain important information to help you take your medications the right way and prevent medication interactions and other medication-related problems.

Labels for over-the-counter (OTC) medications have detailed information to assist in their proper use without the advice of a health care professional. However, over-thecounter medications are not without risks. The use of these medications is relatively safe only when the proper dosage is followed.

Some examples include: ■ If you have high blood pressure or diabetes (high blood sugar), you should not take decongestants without <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> or pharmacist. By reading the label, or asking your pharmacist, you can find out if an OTC cold medicine is safe for you. ■ If you have high blood pressure, or are on a low sodium or salt-free diet, you should avoid products containing sodium bicarbonate (a common antacid) or other forms of sodium.
