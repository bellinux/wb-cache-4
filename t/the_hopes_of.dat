5000|$|In the end, that's {{what this}} {{election}} is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics <b>of</b> <b>hope?</b> John Kerry calls on us to hope.

I'm not talking about blind optimism here [...] - [...] the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial.

It is not <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> God, but <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> man; that is, it is not <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> God's working, but <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> that standeth in natural abilities.

With Adirondack, McGrattan abandoned fighting and tried to play an all-round game in <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>of</b> returning to the NHL.|$|E

At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He often rose at 4a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market.
