This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 1938, White {{represented}} Australia at an inter-governmental {{conference on}} Jewish refugees held at Évian, France, {{to discuss the}} growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories. [...] He expressed remorse after listening to stories from refugees during the conference, but ultimately hedged his offer of support, saying that, [...] "As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration". [...] Australia {{would go on to}} accept 15,000 refugees over three years. White's reaction to the Australian government's support for the Munich Agreement was to diarise: [...] "I think we should hang our heads <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> stand up to the bully of Europe... It may yet mean peace but at what price?" [...] He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war, including the introduction of conscription. On 8November 1938, he resigned his portfolio, having discovered that Joseph Lyons had established an inner cabinet from which he was excluded. Lyons' response in parliament to White's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP. White stood for the UAP's leadership after Lyons' death the following year but was eliminated early in the balloting, and Robert Menzies eventually became leader.|$|E

2500|$|Clarence Hickman {{was born}} on a farm {{established}} by his grandfather Leak on August 16, 1889. The nearest town was Lizton, Indiana to the south. Clarence and his siblings attended the Leak country school until 1898, when the family moved northward to the Job Hadley farm, where the children attended another country school. In both residences, Clarence pursued an interest in archery, playing with bows and arrows made by his father. By his own account, The arrows had heavy heads so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> need feathers to guide the arrow.... We boys shot fish with bows, using umbrella staves as arrows.

2500|$|The actual {{question}} of Goren's radicalism remains controversial. One widely-repeated story about Goren claims that {{shortly after the}} Israeli capture of the Temple Mount, the rabbi either argued that Israel should destroy the al Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock, or simply {{said that it would}} have been a [...] "good thing" [...] if they had been accidentally destroyed. The charge, made by General Narkiss, an eyewitness, in an interview with Haaretz [...] that Rabbi Goren calling for the destruction of the mosques has been used to claim there is a Jewish extremism comparable to Islamic extremism. Goren's close assistant Rabbi Menachem Ha-Cohen who was with Rabbi Goren throughout that historic day denied ever hearing Goren make such a remark. Goren himself personally denied this charge several times. However Goren did make a speech later that year to a military convention, recorded and later broadcast on Israel's army radio in which he said of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque that: ‘Certainly we should have blown it up. It is a tragedy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> do so.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving {{because of its}} scope and severity.... By the beginning of 1997, {{it was clear to}} Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> currently hold.) Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but {{finished}} 5–11, {{with several}} close losses {{coming down to}} the 4th quarter.
