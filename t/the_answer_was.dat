5|$|The Red Bull Air Race was {{conceived}} in 2001 in the Red Bull sports think-tank {{which has been}} responsible for creating a range of new sports events across the world. The aim was to develop a new aviation race that would challenge the ability of the world's best pilots, creating a race in the sky that was not simply about speed, but also precision and skill. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> to build a specially designed obstacle course which the pilots would navigate at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

25|$|In {{the work}} of Niels Abel and Carl Jacobi, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> formulated: this would involve {{functions}} of two complex variables, having four independent periods (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an abelian variety of dimension 2 (an abelian surface): what would now be called the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.|$|E
25|$|When Franz Joseph {{received}} the telegram informing him of Elisabeth's death, his first {{fear was that}} she had committed suicide. It was only when a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, that he was relieved of that notion. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that whatever procedures were prescribed by Swiss Law should be adhered to.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism. Surprisingly, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that all criteria were of roughly equal importance. No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the number and frequency of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated). In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.|$|E

25|$|When {{the inquiry}} {{concerning}} {{the reputation of}} sanctity (super fama) had arrived in Rome, it was opened (as already described in speaking of the ordinary processes, and with the same formalities in regard to rescripts), then translated into Italian, summarized, and declared valid. The documents super fama in general were prepared by the Advocate, and at the proper time, in an ordinary meeting of the cardinals of the Congregation of Rites, the question was discussed: whether there was evidence of a general repute for sanctity and miracles of this servant of God. If <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> favourable, a decree embodying this result was published.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Ole Kassow, a {{resident}} of Copenhagen, wanted to help the elderly get back on their bicycles, {{but he had to}} find a solution to their limited mobility. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> a cycle rickshaw, and he started offering free cycle rickshaw rides to residents of a nearby nursing home. He then got in touch with a civil society consultant at the City of Copenhagen, Dorthe Pedersen, who was intrigued by the idea, and together they bought five cycle rickshaws and launched an organization called Cycling Without Age, which has now spread to all corners of Denmark, and since 2015 to another 28 countries around the world.|$|E
25|$|The Second Vatican Council {{assembled}} approximately 2500 major prelates {{from all}} five continents. It {{soon became clear}} that a dividing up of this large body was necessary. But how to go about carrying out this division? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> by resorting to the already partly existing structures, i.e., the Bishops' Conferences. These would normally coincide with national boundaries, as had long been the case with the German Episcopal Conferences which had existed for over 100 years. A hurried establishment of such entities, willed by the Holy See to be ad hoc, was effected {{for the sole purpose of}} facilitating the working out of common stands on the Council documents. Any bishop who presented a paper in the Council aula in the name of such a conference was granted priority.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} bombers {{had a slight}} {{performance}} advantage over fighters due to having multiple engines and streamlined, but heavy, cantilever wing designs, so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position {{in front of the}} bombers. Before World War II and the invention of radar, detection systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs these systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. This balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little that could be done about it. For Britain, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a deterrent force.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Air New Zealand's {{financial}} position was deteriorating, and Ansett was losing market share to both Qantas {{and a new}} entrant on the Australian domestic market, Virgin Blue. The Air New Zealand board decided that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> to spend still more money, and buy Virgin Blue as well as Ansett. On condition that that deal went through, SIA was prepared to fund the purchase of 32 new aircraft for the Air New Zealand group. Virgin Blue, however, was growing fast, largely {{at the expense of}} Ansett; the initial A$120 million offer was deemed insufficient and in August Virgin Blue owner Sir Richard Branson, with his customary gift for publicity, put an end to negotiations when he tore up on television what he claimed was a A$250 million Air New Zealand cheque. Although the offer may have been genuine the cheque was not - it was actually a cheque from a book of one of the airport managers drawn on a Qantas' staff credit union account.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{described}} {{the size of}} Haldane’s planned Expeditionary Force (six divisions of three brigades each and a cavalry division of four brigades) as simply a “reshuffle” of the troops available in Britain, and often declared that “there was no military problem to which <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> six divisions”. Foch {{is supposed to have}} told Wilson that he would be happy for Britain to send just a corporal and four men, provided it was right {{from the start of the}} war, and that he promised to get them killed, so that Britain would come into the war with all her strength. Foch, recently returned from a visit to Russia, was concerned that France might not be able to count on Russian support in the event of war, and was more keen than ever to enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter’s wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.|$|E

25|$|In October 1991, Chrétien first {{gave his}} views {{about how best}} to end the {{recession}} which had begun in 1990. Chrétien argued that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> a policy of slow devaluation where the dollar would be allowed to decline against other major world currencies, which would have the effect of both pricing out foreign imports and by giving Canadian firms a competitive advantage in world markets, boost exports. However, Chrétien concluded that his planned export offensive powered by a low dollar would come to nothing if other nations maintained tariffs to keep Canadian goods out of their markets. In order to make his plans to export Canada back into prosperity work, Chrétien decided that the solution was globalization. Besides for globalization, Chrétien also argued to combat the recession, the federal government needed to make the system of unemployment insurance less generous, and to end the policy of high interest rates maintained by the Bank of Canada governor John Crow to achieve his target of 0% inflation, which Chrétien argued was needlessly crippling the economy.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{was born}} in Riyadh, growing up there in a working-class environment, to a family of Hadhrami descent from the Hadhramaut Governorate. His father Abdulrahman Ahmed was a former player, he the {{youngest}} of two sisters and three older brothers, Ahmad, Khaled and Mohammed. He began playing football {{at a very young}} age and was playing most of his time in Riyadh neighborhoods. He drew attention from scout Abdulrahman Eissa, who saw him by chance at Al Malaz yard near Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and admired his talent and asked about the club that he played for. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that he was not playing for any club and also did not hold Saudi nationality. After Abdulrahman Eissa began to contact him and his brother, he then began participating in tournaments and courses alongside Yahya Al-Shehri. In 2000, he went on a trial with Al Hilal who were very interested in signing him. However, as full Saudi nationality was only offered to him and not his entire family, his father rejected the offer. Then a call came to Abdulrahman Eissa's friend Ahmed Al Garoon from Honorary member of Al Ain, Nasser bin Thaloub who was searching for young talented players. Abdulrahman Eissa told him about Omar's talent and his brothers Mohammed and Khalid. He asked for their passports and they joined the external Al Ain camp in Germany. Al Ain agreed to grant citizenship to his whole family who then moved to the United Arab Emirates. Omar joined the club with two of his brothers and enrolled in the club's youth academy.|$|E

500|$|Working with Barrett {{eventually}} {{proved too}} difficult, and matters {{came to a}} conclusion in January while {{en route to a}} performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett.

Waters later admitted, [...] "He was our friend, {{but most of the time}} we now wanted to strangle him". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.|$|E
500|$|O'Neill became {{interested}} in the idea of space colonization in 1969 while he was teaching freshman physics at Princeton University. His students were growing cynical about the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the Vietnam War.
