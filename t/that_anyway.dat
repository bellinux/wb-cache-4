5|$|In 1960, Szilard was {{diagnosed}} with bladder cancer. He underwent cobalt therapy at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital using a cobalt 60 treatment regimen that he designed himself. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The doctors tried {{to tell him that}} the increased radiation dose would kill him, but he said it wouldn't, and <b>that</b> <b>anyway</b> he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} Grant whether Cameron had {{encouraged}} the Metropolitan Police to [...] "drag their feet" [...] on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, {{and stated that}} police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: [...] "20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with <b>that,</b> <b>anyway?</b> It doesn't hurt anyone particularly." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian divided the personal effects of the departed loyalists among the remaining crew and threw the breadfruit plants into the sea. He recognised that Bligh could conceivably survive to report the mutiny, and <b>that</b> <b>anyway</b> the non-return of Bounty would occasion a search mission, with Tahiti as its first port of call. Christian therefore headed Bounty towards the small island of Tubuai, some [...] south of Tahiti. Tubuai had been discovered and roughly charted by Cook; except for a single small channel, it was entirely surrounded by a coral reef and could, Christian surmised, be easily defended against any attack from the sea.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Somethin' like <b>that,</b> <b>anyways.</b> Can't ye fancy ould Barber Brady wid {{a bullet}} in his lungs, coughin' like a sick monkey, an' sayin', [...] "Bhoys, I do not mind your gettin' dhrunk, but you must hould your liquor like men. The man that shot me is dhrunk. I'll suspend {{investigations}} for six hours, while I get this bullet cut out, an' then--"' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he agreed, [...] "I guess <b>that's</b> so. <b>Anyway,</b> {{the game}} can't last much longer; they'll {{have to use}} our guns {{in the next few}} days." ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do <b>that.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't say so! Well, <b>that's</b> good, <b>anyway.</b> Why! didn't you' get it changed?" [...] {{demanded the}} young man with painful {{surprise}} as his mate handed him the bank-note.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear, don't you {{remember}} what I said before? Of course I-' 'But how can you?--the wash-up?' 'Do you think <b>that</b> worries? <b>Anyway,</b> I'll give the job to Father Roubeau, here.|$|R

6000|$|The girl's laugh rang harshly {{through the}} roar of the hail. [...] "I don't know. What does <b>that</b> matter, <b>anyway?</b> Can't you understand? The wheat will all be cut down. I have ruined Charley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a {{dangerous}} man," [...] Payne said thoughtfully. [...] "Pat, you came near being a----ass <b>that</b> day. <b>Anyway,</b> it's {{time we went}} in, and as Larry's here I shouldn't wonder if we saw Courthorne again before the morning." ...|$|R
3000|$|I was surprised. There {{was nothing}} {{specific}} to the municipality, but more regional issues, topics we feel we cannot affect <b>that</b> much <b>anyway,</b> because other actors – the regional cooperation body and PTA itself – have overall responsibility for all the municipalities together.

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jim, decisively, [...] "I wasn't quite doing <b>that.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> it {{was your}} money. I got only a share of it; and you didn't figure I'd stay back there {{weighing}} out flour and sugar {{when there was a}} gold strike on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least. Nothing {{will ever}} do any good. As for {{offending}} him, {{you might as}} well swear at a tree, and think to offend it. There's comfort in <b>that,</b> <b>anyway.</b> I wonder whether he'd talk to you if I went away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but those}} are all for curing the skin, and I suppose we're really dying of heart disease, aren't we? Derek feels <b>that,</b> <b>anyway,</b> and, you see, he's not a bit wise, not even patient--so I expect he'll have to go. I mean to be ready, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Verbal," [...] Shorty snapped him short. [...] "It's your say-so against theirs, <b>that's</b> all. Well, <b>anyway,</b> what's your name, pardner?" ...|$|R
50|$|Humidity has a {{comparatively}} small {{effect on the}} speed of sound. Going from zero to 100% relative humidity should change the frequency by less than a two-degree-Celsius change in room temperature. As the player's breath has ~100% relative humidity, the humidity can't vary <b>that</b> much <b>anyway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Wanganui and Rangitikei {{electorate}} {{was formed}} for the [...] Dr Isaac Featherston {{was the first}} representative; he had been elected unopposed. Featherston resigned on 9 August 1855, but this did not cause a by-election, as the next election was to be held later <b>that</b> year <b>anyway.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{particular}} about <b>that,</b> <b>anyway,</b> a forty-four Winchester," [...] he said. [...] "The fellow had long boots on with one heel down, {{and he stood}} right here waiting for Harry. Harry was coming along yonder with the deer, forty yards I make it, and he jumped when the fellow started shooting." ...|$|E

50|$|The 1902 Coronation Honours were {{announced}} on 26 June 1902, the date originally {{set for the}} coronation of King Edward VII.

6000|$|... 'Oh! I didn't mean that; but anybody may outlive anybody for <b>that</b> matter. <b>Anyway,</b> there's {{no chance}} {{of any of these}} schemes coming to pass while we are young enough to care, even if they ever do; and if they unsettle us now, it would be unmitigated damage.' ...|$|R
50|$|Carpenter and Kirkland (1998) listed 12 {{additional}} teeth {{from the}} same area as the holotype tooth, and tentatively added a robust tibia (USNM 9154) to the genus.

6000|$|... "Heard about a fellow," [...] {{continued}} Tom--" [...] {{fellow named}} Gene Wolf, I think it was--that was so broke {{he was sleeping}} in Bryant Park, {{and he made a}} hundred thousand dollars on his first play--or, no; tell you how it was: he sold it outright for ten thousand--something like <b>that,</b> <b>anyway.</b> I got that right from a fellow that's met him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know.

40|$|I defend an {{argument}} from Lauren Ashwell and Eric Marcus {{to the effect}} that the zombie idea is meaningless.
