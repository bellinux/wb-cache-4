5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> started using the building in January 1821.|$|E

5|$|While {{moving through}} the Florida Keys, Irene {{produced}} a storm surge of up to 2.3feet (0.7m) in Key Vaca, while Key West reported a surge of 1.5feet (0.5m). The hurricane produced sustained winds peaking at 79mph (127km/h); it also produced strong gusts, the strongest of which was clocked at 102mph (164km/h) at Big Pine Key. Irene produced heavy rainfall in <b>the</b> <b>Keys,</b> including 12inches (305mm) of rain in Key West. The rainfall flooded roads throughout <b>the</b> <b>Keys,</b> prompting officials to close 50miles (80km) of U.S. Highway 1. Irene spawned a tornado in Islamorada, causing heavy damage to three houses. Moderate wind gusts caused power outages throughout <b>the</b> <b>Keys,</b> but damage was overall minor.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E

5|$|Once a {{particular}} level has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. <b>The</b> <b>keys</b> that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> that unlock the portal to the fourth level are found in the second level, <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> that unlock the portal to the fifth level are found in the third level, and <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> that unlock the last level are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.|$|E
5|$|Saint Peter was {{represented}} holding keys {{as early as}} the fifth century. As the Roman Catholic Church considers him the first pope and bishop of Rome, <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> were adopted as a papal emblem; they first appear with papal arms in the 13th century. Two keys perpendicular were often used on coins, but beginning in the 15th century were used to represent St. Peter's Basilica. Perpendicular keys last appeared in the shield of the papacy in 1555, after which the crossed keys are used exclusively. <b>The</b> <b>keys</b> are gold and silver, with the gold key placed to dexter (viewer's left) on the personal arms of the Pope, although two silver keys or two gold keys were used late into the 16th century. <b>The</b> <b>keys</b> as a symbol of Saint Peter may be found within many coats of arms; the coat of arms of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen displayed two argent (silver) crossed keys as Saint Peter is the patron saint of the Bremian archiepiscopal cathedral.|$|E
