In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|Alive or Just Breathing is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just Breathing was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities. Alive or Just Breathing has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{initially}} {{is typically}} with pain medications. It is generally recommended that people continue with activities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities. Often {{all that is}} required is time: in about 90% of people the problem goes away in less than six weeks. If the pain is severe and lasts {{for more than six}} weeks then surgery may be an option. While surgery often speeds pain improvement, long term benefits are unclear. Surgery may be required if complications occur such as bowel or bladder problems. Many treatments, including steroids, gabapentin, acupuncture, heat or ice, and spinal manipulation, have poor evidence for their use.|$|E
25|$|To help Tyler Thigpen {{prepare for}} the game against the Jets, the Chiefs {{implemented}} the spread offense to help Thigpen {{and the rest of}} the younger players play <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities, and also following the absence of RB Larry Johnson due to suspension. The Chiefs made a huge gamble by doing so, as most in the NFL believe that a spread offense cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans. Prior to the Chiefs implementing the spread offense, Thigpen had been playing erratically with the Chiefs, and he suddenly became poised and effective running the new offense.|$|E
25|$|In March, Brig. Gen. P.G.T.

Beauregard made repeated demands that the Union force either surrender or withdraw and took steps to ensure that no supplies from the city were available to the defenders, whose food was running low. He also increased drills amongst the South Carolina militia, training them to operate the guns they manned. Ironically, Major Anderson had been Beauregard's artillery instructor at West Point; the two had been especially close, and Beauregard had become Anderson's assistant after graduation.

25|$|In Islam, {{there are}} four sources from which Muslim {{scholars}} extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwa. The first is the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the Sunnah, which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific question from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs {{what is known as}} ijtihad. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning {{to come up with the}} best answer according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability.|$|E
25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} cut off outside resupply of {{the protesters}} on June 19, 2008.

In response to the cutting off of supplies the City Council voted to send two city officials to the grove to check on the welfare of the protesters on June 24, 2008. The two officials, the Assistant City Manager and the Assistant Fire Chief, reported to the City Council on June 25, 2008, the protesters did indeed have sufficient food and water, and would refuse any supplies offered by the UCPD. Later that same day Mayor Tom Bates and City Manager Phil Kamlarz met with university officials to discuss the health of the tree-sitters.|$|E

25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the ERs, an in vitro study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, {{at a variety of}} other steroid hormone receptors. Whereas the study found EC50 values of 0.18nM and 0.06nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the drug showed significant glucocorticoid activity at a concentration of 1μm that surpassed that of 0.1nM dexamethasone as well as significant antagonism of the androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, at a concentration of 1μm). It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of PPARγ and LXRα at a concentration of 10μm. The researchers stated that, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed). However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in animal models at pharmacologically relevant doses.|$|E
25|$|Spice Planet is an {{alternate}} Dune story written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson {{based upon the}} original story outline that Frank Herbert made for Dune. It features House Linkam (a version of House Atreides) temporarily taking control of Duneworld from their rivals, House Hoskanner (the forerunner of the Harkonnens), to settle a dispute between them. The Hoskanners had received a monopoly concession on the recently discovered Duneworld, but as melange had grown in popularity in the Empire, other Houses had begun to dislike the Hoskanner's wealth and pushed House Linkam to challenge House Hoskanner. The Emperor, secretly allied with the Hoskanners, orders Linkam to take over Duneworld for two years with the promise that if they produce more melange, then they will receive the concession — else it will go permanently to the Hoskanners. Much like in Dune, the Hoskanners sabotage and thwart <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities, although the Linkams enlist {{the help of the}} Imperial Planetologist to devise a way to neutralize the sandworms and vastly increase the efficiency of operations.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{planned for}} December, {{a variety of}} {{problems}} delayed the first Steinbock raid until the night of 21/22 January 1944. Using every trick the RAF had developed, Luftwaffe pathfinders dropped white marker flares along the route and marked London in green. Throughout the raid the attackers dropped large quantities of Düppel, which successfully jammed the 1.5m band radars. A number of newer centrimetric sets had recently been deployed, and these were able to continue guiding the fighters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities given operator overload. Mosquitos of ADGB claimed 16 bombers destroyed or probable, while the new centimetric guided anti-aircraft artillery added another 9. A further 18 German aircraft never returned, having become lost or crashing while landing. This represented about 10% of the attacking force of 447 bombers. This sort of loss exchange ratio was greater than the Luftwaffe typically managed to achieve against the RAF, and great enough that continued missions with these sorts of losses would quickly deplete the force. For all of this effort, the bombers dropped a total of only 30 tons on the city, causing 14 killed and 74 injured, {{a tiny fraction of}} the nightly load during The Blitz. Hitler was apoplectic.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

500|$|Since he {{was working}} with a largely non-professional cast, Forman's {{operating}} procedure was never to share the script with any of the performers, because if he had given them the screenplay, [...] "they’ll take it home to read, and their wives will end up directing your movie". [...] Instead, he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes, reciting the dialog from memory only one time, so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to try to remember {{as much as they could}} of what he had told them and then improvise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability what they had forgotten or only half-understood.

Fraser McAlpine of BBC regarded the song as a [...] "dancefloor-friendly tune with an insistent chorus that echoes around your head", and compared it to the group's music from previous years.

500|$|As {{in other}} Eastern Bloc countries, {{there was a}} Soviet-style {{political}} purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of [...] "nationalist" [...] or other [...] "deviationist" [...] tendencies. In September, Władysław Gomułka who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together {{with a group of}} communist leaders who like Gomułka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from Leninism, and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary. Gomułka, accused of [...] "right-wing nationalist deviations", had indeed emphasized the Polish socialist traditions and severely criticized Rosa Luxemburg's SDKPiL party for belittling Polish national aspirations. More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomułka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy. Following Bolesław Bierut's order, he was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by Romkowski and Fejgin, as demanded by the Soviets. Gomułka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, Jakub Berman and other Stalin's associates. Under interrogation he defiantly conducted his defense, threatened to reveal [...] "the whole truth" [...] if put on a trial, and remained unbroken. Gomułka was thus placed in prison without a typical show trial until released in December 1954. Bierut, heading the victorious PPR faction whose members spent the war in the Soviet Union, replaced Gomułka as the PPR (and then the PZPR) leader. Gomułka remained protected by his Polish comrades <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability and the record of his sometime defiance came in handy when in 1956 there was an opportunity for the Polish party to reassert itself.|$|E
