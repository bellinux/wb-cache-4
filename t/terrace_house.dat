5|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 March 1997, Sylvia Sheils and Mary Callinan were found dead in No.1 Orchard View, Grangegorman, Dublin 7. They were found by Ann Mernagh, another {{resident}} of the house, who raised the alarm at No.5 Orchard View. The house was a two story end of <b>terrace</b> <b>house</b> owned by the Eastern Health Board, and was used to provide sheltered accommodation for outpatients of St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital. The entire Orchard View area was completely demolished 15 years after the murders and is now an empty plot surrounded by a wall.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built <b>terrace</b> <b>house</b> at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E

She and James Lingwood of Artangel looked at houses to be torn down in North and East London in 1992, but without success in securing one. During this period in 1992 and 1993 Whiteread had an artist residency in Berlin with a scholarship from the DAAD Artist's Programme. While in Berlin, she created Untitled (Room), {{the cast of}} a generic, anonymous room that she built herself. She finished {{the interior of a}} room-size box with wallpaper, windows and door before casting. The sculpture is {{in the collection of the}} Museum of Modern Art in New York.|$|E
25|$|During the ten-year {{project to}} build the Elan Valley dams, the navvies (workers) lived in a village of wooden huts near the site. This settlement, which was {{strictly}} controlled to keep order and health, would eventually become Elan Village (see Elan Valley). Guards controlled access in and out; this was done to reduce illness and to stop liquor smuggling. All new workers were deloused and examined for infectious diseases before being admitted. To keep order, {{a man and his}} wife shared a <b>terrace</b> <b>house</b> with eight single men. A school was provided for under-11-year-olds, who were expected to work on attaining that age. The camp also had a hospital for injuries, an isolation hospital for infectious cases, and a bath house. Men were allowed to drink beer at a pub, though women were not. Other facilities included a library, public hall, shop and canteen.|$|E

25|$|A new wing, {{called the}} Millennium Wing, was opened in 2002. Unlike the {{previous}} two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson & Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland Stone façade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian <b>terrace</b> <b>house</b> and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Pleanála, required that they be retained. The Millennium Wing {{is not without its}} critics: it is unforgiving of poor maintenance and the compromise in the design as required by An Bord Pleanala resulted in a final design diluted from the original competition winning building concept. The circulation space also lacks clarity, but it is generally considered that these flaws are trivial details set against the drama of the building. In line with its Brutalist style, the interior concrete walls are still unsealed.|$|E
500|$|Kate Elizabeth Winslet {{was born}} on 5 October 1975 in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Sally Anne (née Bridges) and Roger John Winslet. Her mother worked as a nanny and waitress, and her father, a {{struggling}} actor, took labouring jobs to support the family. Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We never felt like the poor kids, which is absolutely a credit to my parents. We lived in a lovely <b>terrace</b> <b>house</b> and we all had each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward {{appeared}} on Independent Television News, where he endorsed Profumo's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as [...] "baseless". Ward's own activities {{had become a}} matter of official concern, and on 1 April the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and tapped his telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester <b>Terrace</b> <b>house.</b> The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.|$|E

500|$|Born in {{the western}} Melbourne suburb of Sunshine on 28 November 1919, Keith Ross Miller was the {{youngest}} of Leslie (Les Sr) and Edith (Edie) Miller's four children. He had two older brothers and a sister. Sister Gladys was 12 when Miller was born, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven respectively.Perry, p. 11. Miller was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers Keith and Ross Smith, who were half-way through their historic flight from England to Australia {{at the time of his}} birth.Perry, p. 10. Miller's two Christian names reflected his Scottish heritage; his father's family originated from the dock area of Edinburgh and Dundee, and his paternal grandfather arrived in Australia in April 1849. The family lived in a one-level <b>terrace</b> <b>house</b> in Sunshine, which at the time was a separate town of 900 people, [...] west of Melbourne's city centre. The area was and remains a working-class area. The town's lifeblood was the farm machinery maker H. V. McKay, which employed a large proportion of the population. Miller's father started as a teacher in Warracknabeal in rural Victoria, before working as an engineer for McKay in Ballarat until a transfer brought him to Sunshine.|$|E

He continued to send money home and purchased for his family 150 acre (607,000m²) of farmland in East Lyme, Connecticut. Babbitt started after hours [...] "Action Analysis" [...] classes and brought in Don Graham to teach. Tytla was an eager participator in these classes (later to become officially sanctioned by Disney) which have been credited with some of the phenomenal leaps in the quality of animation during this period.|$|E

2500|$|The {{layout of}} the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern, cut through by wide radial boulevards and parklands {{surrounding}} the central city was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s.

Melbourne quickly became a major finance centre, home to several banks, the Royal Mint, and Australia's first stock exchange in 1861.
