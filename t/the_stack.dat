5|$|For the {{algorithm}} to be correct, {{it must be}} the case that popping and merging the top two clusters from {{the algorithm}}'s stack preserves the property that the remaining clusters on <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> form a chain of nearest neighbors.|$|E
50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of <b>the</b> current <b>stack</b> and generates <b>the</b> next state, <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> to be pushed and popped onto <b>the</b> embedded <b>stack,</b> <b>the</b> pushing and popping of <b>the</b> current <b>stack,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> to be considered <b>the</b> current <b>stacks</b> in <b>the</b> next transition. More conceptually, <b>the</b> embedded <b>stack</b> is pushed and popped, <b>the</b> current <b>stack</b> is optionally pushed back onto <b>the</b> embedded <b>stack,</b> and any other stacks one would like are pushed on top of that, with <b>the</b> last <b>stack</b> being <b>the</b> one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can be pushed both above and below <b>the</b> current <b>stack.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} of hydrogen solubility and the hydrogen embrittlement of high strength, high performance {{face centered cubic}} alloys to <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> fault energy of the alloys was investigated. <b>The</b> <b>stacking</b> fault energy is inversely related to {{the distance between the}} two partial dislocations which are formed by the dissociation of a perfect dislocation.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:42a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot high stack, {{consisting of}} about 5000logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58students and former students working on <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> 12 {{were killed and}} 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies.|$|E
5|$|In its later years, {{students}} building Bonfire used logs {{donated by}} local landowners who wanted their land cleared for construction or farming.

40|$|We {{report the}} effects of {{accumulated}} strain by <b>stacking</b> on <b>the</b> surface and optical properties of stacked 1. 3 mu m InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) structures grown by MOCVD. It is found that the surface of <b>the</b> <b>stacked</b> QD structures {{becomes more and more}} undulated with <b>stacking,</b> due to <b>the</b> increased strain in <b>the</b> <b>stacked</b> QD structures with <b>stacking.</b> <b>The</b> photoluminescence intensity from the QD structures first increases as <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> number increases from 1 to 3 and then dramatically decreases as it further increases, implying {{a significant increase in the}} density of crystal defects in <b>the</b> <b>stacked</b> QD structures due to the accumulated strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strain can be reduced by simply introducing annealing steps just after growing the GaAs spacers during the deposition of <b>the</b> <b>stacked</b> QD structures, leading to significant improvement in the surface and optical properties of the structures.

5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. <b>The</b> <b>stack</b> is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland.

5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20.

The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the rear wall of the firebox. The attic once housed a large loom that was later moved down to the west side of the cellar. Amos G.

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
