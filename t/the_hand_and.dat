There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of <b>the</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>and</b> Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes).

40|$|Ride {{quality in}} {{vehicles}} can {{be influenced by}} multiple-input vibration: vibration simultaneously transmitted to the body via multiple vibrating surfaces, such as steering wheels, seats, and floors. Standardised methods of predicting the discomfort of multiple-input vibration (ISO 2631 - 1, 1997) do {{not take into account}} vibration of <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> or <b>the</b> phase between vibration input to <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> feet, <b>and</b> the seat. This research seeks to understand the mechanisms associated with discomfort caused by multiple-input vertical vibration, examining the effect of vibration frequency, vibration magnitude, input location, and phase between vibration at <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> seat, <b>and</b> the feet, at frequencies between 2 and 12. 5 Hz. A total of four psychophysical laboratory experiments were conducted. Three studies were designed to expand knowledge of the absolute and relative sensitivity to vibration at the inputs, or between the three inputs, by determining: (i) absolute thresholds for perception of vibration (minimum levels of vibration that can be detected) at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> feet (Experiment 1); (ii) equivalent comfort contours for vibration (levels of vibration that produce similar discomfort across the range of frequencies) at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> feet (Experiment 2); and (iii) the equivalence of vibration sensation (vibration magnitudes required to produce equivalent discomfort) between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet (from 2 to 12. 5 Hz), between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seat (from 4 to 12. 5 Hz), and between the seat and the feet (from 4 to 12. 5 Hz) (Experiment 3). The findings indicate similar absolute thresholds at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet between 2 and 5 Hz, with the thresholds having constant velocity. At frequencies between 5 and 12. 5 Hz, absolute thresholds have constant acceleration at the feet while continuing to have constant velocity at the hands: an indication that different mechanisms may be involved in the detection of threshold levels of vibration at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet between 5 and 12. 5 Hz. Contours of equivalent comfort at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet between 2 and 12. 5 Hz resemble the shapes of the absolute thresholds, with little dependence in vibration magnitude. The relative magnitudes of vibration required to produce equivalent discomfort at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet, or at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seat, depend on the frequency of vibration and indicate greater sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat than at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet over the frequency range investigated. A clear difference in the frequency-dependence of sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat from those at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet suggests a separate mechanism for detecting supra-threshold vibration of the seat. The final study (Experiment 4) concerned the perception and discomfort of multiple-input vertical vibration with various phases between vibration at pairs of inputs, so as to determine: (a) difference thresholds (just noticeable differences, JNDs) for the detection of phase differences, (b) the effect of phase on discomfort, and (c) the localisation (i. e. body location) at which phase differences are detected. The results suggest that phase differences between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet at frequencies greater than 5 Hz are unlikely to be detected, and that any phase differences between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet over the range 2 to 12. 5 Hz are unlikely to influence discomfort. Phase differences between <b>the</b> seat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> or between <b>the</b> seat and the feet, over the range 4 to 12. 5 Hz were detected by some subjects and increased discomfort up to 50 % (when changing phase only, with no change in vibration magnitude). Over the three inputs (i. e. <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> feet, <b>and</b> the seat) sensitivity to vertical vibration was greatest at the seat <b>and</b> least at <b>the</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>The</b> phase between the inputs can affect discomfort, but only when vibration is applied at the seat. Changes in discomfort due to vibration frequency, vibration magnitude, or phase differences between the inputs may be partly associated with changes in the body locations experiencing greatest discomfort, due to different paths for the transmission of vibration into the body. The research has increased understanding of how multiple-input vibration applied simultaneously at <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> seat, <b>and</b> the feet contribute to produce an overall sensation of discomfort. <br/...|$|R
5|$|However, {{his career}} turned sour in a match against Victoria in January 1930. After {{contributing}} three not out in Western Australia's first innings of 187, Halcombe opened the bowling for Western Australia from the pavilion {{end of the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground. He delivered the first three balls to Clive Sindrey who took a single from the third ball. Leo O'Brien then faced Halcombe and umpire Andrew Barlow no-balled Halcombe six times in succession from square leg. One of the balls struck O'Brien in <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> forced him to retire with a burst blister on the palm, while another went for four byes. After the first two no ball decisions, the Western Australian captain Richard Bryant conferred with Barlow, but when Halcombe resumed, the umpire continued to call him for throwing. After the sixth no ball, Halcombe threw the ball to his skipper in disgust. After another discussion, he bowled at significantly reduced pace and completed his over. Victoria took a lead of 22, before Western Australia compiled 311, with Halcombe scoring 10 not out. With Halcombe out of the attack, Victoria {{went on to win}} by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from <b>the</b> <b>hand)</b> <b>and</b> metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. <b>The</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cartilaginous tumors {{involving}} the small bones of <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet are usually benign such as enchondroma, chondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma. The small bones of <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet are rarely involved by primary chondrosarcoma. Proximal phalanges {{are the most}} common sites in <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> but <b>the</b> fourth digit is the least common site. Case Presentation: We report a case of a 76 -year-old Greek female who presented to our hospital with a painful swollen mass measuring 4. 5 × 2. 6 cm on the fourth digit of <b>the</b> left <b>hand.</b> <b>The</b> radiograph showed a destructive, permeative lytic tumor of the proximal phalanx with extension into soft tissue. The patient underwent curettage, and the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed grade 2 chondrosarcoma. Conclusion: Cartilaginous tumors {{involving the}} small bones of <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet are usually benign such as enchondroma, chondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma. Primary chondrosarcoma is the third most common malignancy of bone after myeloma and osteosarcoma, but the small bones of <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet are very rarely involved by chondrosarcoma (1 % of all chondrosarcoma). However, in these cases differentiation between a benign lesion and chondrosarcoma may be difficult.

5|$|Three days later, Admiral Coligny {{was walking}} back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> arm. A smoking arquebus was {{discovered}} in a window, but the culprit had made his escape {{from the rear of}} the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.|$|E
5|$|Upon the resumption, Crapp {{began to}} accelerate, hitting a six—which flew {{directly}} {{back over the}} bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three driven boundaries from the off spin of Ian Johnson. This was {{a stark contrast to}} Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—leg before wicket for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a single to get off the mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain Norman Yardley came in and played the fast bowling of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow himself more time to play his shots. Edrich was struck on <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, {{the players were}} greeted by sunshine, and a large Saturday crowd had arrived from afar to watch proceedings; as a result, the gates were closed by 9:00 {{in the morning with}} the ground already filled. The large gallery again encroached on the playing arena, which was not fenced. In the first hour, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball. Miller was beaten three times in one over by Bedser before Pollard trapped him for 31, after Australia had added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Bedser removed Morris for 51, leaving Australia 139/5. It had been a slow morning for Morris, who took 21 minutes to add to his overnight total and reached his half-century 45 minutes into the day's play, having added only four runs to his overnight score. At the same time, Barnes had come out to bat upon Miller's dismissal, despite having collapsed while practising in the nets due to the aftereffects of his rib injury. He batted after refusing to stay in hospital and returning to the ground in spite of his bruised and discoloured ribs. He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before the injury became too much and he had to be taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, before being sent to hospital to be put under observation. Barnes would eventually miss {{two and a half weeks}} of cricket. Tallon and Loxton added a further 33 before the former was caught behind from Edrich with the score at 172/6. Lindwall came into bat with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on. He received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> caused visible pain, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, still five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Pollard in the direction of Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold on to the ball at full stretch, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Lindwall was the last man out for 23, while Toshack was unbeaten without scoring. Australia were thus bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.|$|E
