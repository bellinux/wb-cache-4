After learning of the attack, Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police, and Exley goes into hiding.|$|E

After managing in the minors for one season, Gromek retired from <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>baseball,</b> {{and worked as a}} car insurance sales representative. He and his wife, Jeanette, had three sons, Carl, Greg and Brian. Greg and Carl both pitched for the Florida State Seminoles baseball team, and Greg, who pitched in the Tigers' organization for four years, made the transition from infielder to pitcher after college just as his father had.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>baseball,</b> the {{official}} scorer {{is a person}} appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send {{the official}} scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E
5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>baseball.</b> Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> was {{introduced}} to the island in the late 19th century, by Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States.

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>baseball</b> began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for {{recreation}} into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E
