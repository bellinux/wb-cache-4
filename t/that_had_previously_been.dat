5|$|As the war progressed, Temple was {{promoted}} to colonel and became governor of Tilbury Fort in Essex, a post <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>previously</b> <b>been</b> held by his father. The fort was close to Temple's childhood home at Longhouse Place and was of strategic importance because it controlled the approach to London by river.

The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>previously</b> <b>been</b> classified as vitamins, as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B-complex.|$|E
