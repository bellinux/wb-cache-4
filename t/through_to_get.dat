Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It {{never occurred to me}} to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, like most of the movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> somebody else to do it." ...|$|E

[...] Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – [...] "what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing."

He ended his review by giving the episode 9.5 out of 10, the highest rating he had given for the second season. Stephen Lackey of Mania gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] grading, though he felt it was [...] "rushed overall" [...] and thought the virus story was not as powerful as the explosion story in season one. Jason Hughes of TV Squad also felt that the stage was set for a good third volume, which he hoped would [...] "get even darker and more dangerous". Sean Elliott of If gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] grading, saying it was an [...] "anti-climactic ending to an uninspired second season". He liked Kristen Bell's character Elle, saying she was [...] "interesting", and [...] "worth exploring and developing". He said that his favourite part of the episode was that the [...] "season [...] finally over", and that it was [...] "time to clean the slate and start with something better". Robin Brownfield of SyFy Portal called it a [...] "great finale" [...] and said that [...] "there were lots of twists [...] did not see coming". Sean O'Neal of The A.V.

2500|$|Shared {{situation}} awareness {{can be defined}} as [...] "the degree to which team members possess the same SA on shared SA requirements" [...] (Endsley & Jones, 1997, p.47; 2001, p.48). As implied by this definition, there are information requirements that are relevant to multiple team members. A major part of teamwork involves the area where these SA requirements overlap—the shared SA requirements that exist {{as a function of the}} essential interdependency of the team members. In a poorly functioning team, two or more members may have different assessments on these shared SA requirements and thus behave in an uncoordinated or even counter-productive fashion. Yet in a smoothly functioning team, each team member shares a common understanding of what is happening on those SA elements that are common—shared SA. Thus, shared SA refers to the overlap between the SA requirements of the team members, as presented in Figure 3. As depicted by the clear areas of the figure, not all information needs to be shared. Clearly, each team member is aware of much that is not pertinent to the others on the team. Sharing every detail of each person's job would only create a great deal of [...] "noise" [...] to sort <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> needed information. [...] It is only that information which is relevant to the SA requirements of each team member that is needed.|$|E
2500|$|Giving {{it three}} out of five stars, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized Damita Jo saying it {{featured}} [...] "a slew of the gooey, structureless sex ballads that have become Janet's staple." [...] Cinquemani also called the songs [...] "Like You Don't Love Me" [...] and [...] "Moist" [...] "two of the album's best." [...] Entertainment Weekly rated it a 'C+' saying [...] "The tracks, many produced by her longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, have the sumptuous, homogenized creaminess we've come to expect from her." [...] Angus Batey of Yahoo! Music UK gave it four out of ten stars, saying [...] "Numerous explanatory spoken word asides seek to reassure us that Janet, as she approaches 40, is seeking love rather than reveling in lust." [...] However, she called [...] "R Junkie" [...] "a delicious throwback, like a glorious 'Rhythm Nation'", [...] "I Want You" [...] "a peculiar post-modern waltz with a '40s supper club vibe, being the ear-catcher", and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] "another precision-tooled winner, with Jackson using an almost ethereal higher-pitched vocal delivery." [...] Neil Strauss of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, saying Damita Jo [...] "smacks of trying too hard. [...] {{the truth is that}} Jackson is just trying to humanize herself, as she did so well on her breakthrough 1986 album, Control [...] Jackson has had eighteen years of monster hits, so it's hard to fault her instincts. [...] but there's too much of Jackson's moistness to wade <b>through</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Damita Jo's solid ground." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music -- as with anything, it all depends on the artist. [...] Damita Jo proves that she was merely flirting with modesty, since it's as explicit as pop music gets." [...] Ian Wade of BBC Music had mixed feelings, saying that [...] "While there's nothing outwardly bad about Damita Jo, at 22 tracks over 65 minutes, your attention does start to wander and you almost forget it's playing. But after a third or fourth listen, the slick grooves of [...] "Spending Time With You" [...] and [...] "Island Life" [...] gain more identity. [...] Damita Jo heralds no real major leap forward, but it's no pig's ear either. A bit of editing and a couple of killer dance tracks would've made it even better." ...|$|E
