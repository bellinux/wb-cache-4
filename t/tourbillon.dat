Santos implemented a new tactical formation based on the 4–4–2 diamond. Benfica played their first game against Swiss second-tier side Stade Nyonnais, beating them by a comfortable margin. They followed this with a win against Shakhtar Donetsk in Yverdon-les-Bains, and a loss against FC Sion at the Stade <b>Tourbillon</b> on 15 July. Benfica returned to Portugal on 16 July; they played a presentation match against Bordeaux on 22 July.

Arnold appears to have experimented with this idea but died in 1799, before he could develop it further.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} century or so vortex {{dynamics}} matured as a subfield of fluid mechanics, always commanding at least a major chapter in treatises on the subject. Thus, H. Lamb's well known Hydrodynamics (6th ed., 1932) devotes a full chapter to vorticity and vortex dynamics as does G. K. Batchelor's Introduction to Fluid Dynamics (1967). In due course entire treatises were devoted to vortex motion. H. Poincaré's Théorie des <b>Tourbillons</b> (1893), H. Villat's Leçons sur la Théorie des <b>Tourbillons</b> (1930), C. Truesdell's The Kinematics of Vorticity (1954), and P. G. Saffman's Vortex Dynamics (1992) may be mentioned.

[...] They also began burying their dead in Chablandes-type stone burial cists with engraved anthropomorphic stelae. [...] The individual graves changed at the beginning of the third Millennium BC in large, dry stone wall communal tombs (such as the Dolmen of Le Petit-Chasseur). [...] During the Beaker culture period in the second half of the third Millennium, dolmens were built once again, but they were smaller and had no podium. [...] Stelae continued to be carved, though these were rich with geometric patterns and sometimes built out of old dolmen.
