40|$|As compeition in many {{industries}} {{becomes increasingly}} global, MNEs {{have found that}} import-substitution subsidiaries, focusing on the supply of national markets, are much less viable. In the pursuit of enhanced competitiveness through export-oriented subsidiaries, MNEs are also finding that relying on low-cost host-country inputs to produce established productss is also a limited strategy. The more dynamic strategy of allowing subsidiaries to use {{a wider range of}} creative local inputs to take full responsibility for the development, production and international marketing of distinctive new products is a more effective approach. Such an upgrading of the subsidiaries' role within the MNE often parallels the aims of host-country governments to achieve a more individual and dynamic basis for their country's evolving comparative advantage. It is thus argued that MNE subsidiaries and host countries can go through a mutually supportive period of creative transition, endowing both with a new level of <b>technological</b> dynamism and <b>independence.</b> The paper tests aspects of these arguments by analysing the host-country determinants of the degree of export-orientation of US MNEs' overseas subsidiaries.

Current Impact Index (CII) is an index that represents technological excellence {{measured by the}} number of citations of one patent by other patents in the previous five years. A higher CII indicates that a patent has high technological capability (Chang et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2007; Chiu and Chen 2007). Technological Strength (TS) demonstrates the excellence of technology by indicating the scale of a company’s influence in a specific technological field. A higher TS means that the company has higher market competitiveness. Therefore, a company with the higher TS in its alliance portfolio may enjoy a dominant position in the market. Another index is <b>Technological</b> <b>Independence</b> (TI) that implies technological innovation is the degree of citations of internal patents developed in an alliance portfolio.

40|$|AbstractTechnology {{transfer}} is a promising approach to increase vaccine production at an affordable price in developing countries. In {{the case of}} influenza, {{it is imperative that}} developing countries acquire the technology to produce pandemic vaccines through the transfer of know-how, as this will be the only way for the majority of these countries to face the huge demand for vaccine created by influenza pandemics. Access to domestically produced influenza vaccine in such health crises is thus an important national defence strategy. However, technology {{transfer is}} not a simple undertaking. It requires a committed provider who is willing to transfer a complete production process, and not just the formulation and fill-finish parts of the process. It requires a recipient with established experience in vaccine production for human use and the ability to conduct research into new developments. In addition, the country of the recipient should preferably have sufficient financial resources to support the undertaking, and an internal market for the new vaccine. Technology transfer should create a solid partnership that results in the joint development of new competency, improvements to the product, and to further innovation.

40|$|Geospatial regions have {{different}} requirements for energy development due to variations in environmental, economic, social, and political constraints which influence their energy demand profiles and generation capacities. These constraints determine the policy, strategy, and implementation priorities for sustainable energy consumption, generation, and distribution. This PhD research project {{focuses on the}} role of interfaces between sustainable energy policy and appropriate technology; and its iterative feedback loop mechanism to encourage the implementation of sustainable energy systems in a vulnerable society. As a novel contribution to knowledge and practice, this PhD work concludes that: 1. Establishing a local business case for indigenous, appropriate technology, utilising a solid network which receives committed, political support, is an effective intervention strategy to fast track the deployment of sustainable energy systems, which breaks the cycle of vulnerability through social transformation and community empowerment. 2. Being aware of their own Western-Educated-Industrialised-Rich-Democratic (WEIRD) mindsets is a first step for knowledge exchange practitioners to overcome cultural differences and to introduce the intervention strategy. This was synthesised from the following new understandings which were obtained as the outputs of this PhD research: 1. Re-interpretation of the theory of vulnerable societies in relation to sustainable energy; 2. Re-interpretation of the theory of sustainable energy in relation to the proposed fourth dimension of sustainability; 3. Re-interpretation on the theory of appropriate technology in relation to <b>technological</b> <b>independence</b> and indigenous wisdom; 4. Novel conceptual model of a vulnerable society’s problem system; 5. Novel conceptual model of the interfaces between sustainable energy policy and appropriate technology in vulnerable societies. It is expected that the outcome of this PhD research can bridge the gaps identified in theoretical sustainable energy policies whilst in practice provide sound advice and confidence for policy makers and initiative implementers in grounding equal access to energy as a fundamental agent of change towards sustainable societal development...|$|E
40|$|China’s {{industrial}} policy for high-technology industries combines key {{features of the}} policies adopted elsewhere in East Asia: judicious opening to foreign investors and support for local firms. However, unlike the developing economies of East Asia, China is a transition economy that already had a relatively well-developed, if somewhat dated, technology base of its own before its opening to outside investors {{at the end of}} the 1970 s. Although the initial technology level of individual firms was low, a network of universities and government research institutes provided a strong foundation for future developments. Like the other high-growth economies of East Asia, China has attracted foreign investment to rapidly expand its industries. But China has been able to leverage the enormous attractiveness of its domestic market to obtain technology transfers from its foreign investors on a scale that was unattainable in the regions other countries. Today, revamped state-owned firms and a host of newly-minted private ones are steadily building local competitive advantage. China’s effort to move beyond dependence on foreign know-how to develop its own intellectual property (IP) in the electronics industry has been moving forward on several fronts, including optical storage, digital television, semiconductor design, and cellular telephony. The indigenous development of IP is a point of national pride, secures China a measure of <b>technological</b> <b>independence</b> and may serve a role in reducing burdensome royalty payments by local producers of high-tech goods.

The article proves that the increase in the speed of changements, instability of socio-economic systems, the diverse risks predetermine the need to develop new methodological approaches to predictive research. The studies aimed at developing a technology for the design of the desired image of the future and the methodology for its evaluation are of high importance. For the initial stage of the research, the authors propose the methodological approach for assessing the desired image of the future of metallurgy as one of the most important industry of the region. We propose the term of «technological image of the regional metallurgy». We show that repositioning the image of the regional metallurgical complex is quite a long process.

The proposed methodology of the evaluation of desired future includes the methodological provisions to quantify the characteristics of goals achieved at the respective stages of the repositioning of the metallurgy. The methodological approach to the design of the desired image of the future implies the following stages: the identification of the priority areas of the technological development of regional metallurgy on the basis of bibliometric and patent analysis; the evaluation of dynamics of the development of the structure of metal products domestic consumption based on comparative analysis and relevant analytical methods as well as its forecasting; the design of the factor model, allowing to identify the parameters quantifying the technological image of the regional metallurgy based on the principal components method,; systematization of predicted values of the parameters defining the stages of repositioning and designing the new technological image of the regional metallurgy; the development of mathematical model for the recognition of the technological image of a regional metallurgy on the basis of neural networks...|$|E
