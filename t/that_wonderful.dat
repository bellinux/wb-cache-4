His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the track}} for AOL Radio Blog, Voerding wrote [...] "Michele's voice {{is among the}} cast's most versatile, striding {{confidently}} through growls and whispers, proclamations and wavering cries. This single, with the drive of its melody and narrative, is no exception." [...] Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Michele's voice on the song [...] "phenomenal," [...] and commented [...] "I love how her vocals are reined in, and then build up to <b>that</b> <b>wonderful</b> glory note. I seriously got chills while listening to it." [...] She also commented how the song's narrative fit Michele's storyline on the show. Christopher Rosen of Movieline wrote [...] "If you love Lea Michele’s voice, you’ll like [...] "Get It Right." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said [...] "This one, compared to the instantly catchy “Loser Like Me”, {{is a bit more}} underwhelming, though Lea kills it." [...] Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said [...] "Lea Michele's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad, but without that secret ingredient, lyrics like [...] "my best intentions keep making a mess of things" [...] are best left to Rachel's diary." [...] Although she called it [...] "boring" [...] and said it was like every other reflection-ballad performed by Michele, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio. Melinda Newman of HitFix said the song was [...] "lovely, but a bit dull." ...|$|E

Jason Damas from PopMatters praised the track for being [...] "a sure contender for future single release", in addition to calling it his [...] "favorite song on the album". He further added: [...] "No Doubt fans who always secretly suspected that Stefani may someday move to become a Madonna-like dance diva will find their proof in this cut, which plagiarizes Kylie Minogue's [...] "Fever" [...] but makes the song even bigger and catchier." [...] Winnie McCroy of The Villager claimed that [...] "Serious" [...] has staying power; he continued: [...] "Despite your best attempts to shake it, you will find yourself humming the chorus", later comparing the track to Madonna's 1992 single [...] "Erotica", and Falco's 1985 single [...] "Rock Me Amadeus". Also in a highly positive review, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine favored [...] "Serious" [...] for [...] "flawlessly recreat the throwaway lyrics, vocal phrasing and background vocals, and synth sounds of the '80s". A critic from Sputnikmusic awarded the recording five out of a five stars, calling it [...] "one of the better songs on the album". The reviewer noted Kanal's role in the song's production: [...] "this song wouldn't be <b>that</b> <b>wonderful</b> without him". Another highly positive review came from Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound; in his review of the parent record, he called it [...] "another catchy melody and addictive arrangement from the platinum blonde star".

2500|$|Swamiji {{elaborated}} on {{the reasons}} for the near total elimination of the Buddhist religion (Mahayana Buddhism) from India. He said that [...] "At the present day there is not one who calls oneself a Buddhist in India, the land of its birth." [...] This was because Buddha's philosophy clashed with the [...] "eternal rocks of the Vedas" [...] to which people, Brahmin's in particular, were wedded {{and did not want to}} accept change. Thus Buddhism could not survive in India. When Buddha was asked by his Brahmin disciples to translate his works, which were in the local language of the people, to Sanskrit, his reply was [...] "I am for the poor, for the people; let me speak in the tongue of the people."
