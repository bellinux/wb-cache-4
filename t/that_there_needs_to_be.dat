According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research {{there would be little}} medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes {{we do not have the}} moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E

For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if nonimaging optics are used. For higher concentrations, however, if the mirrors or lenses do not move, then {{the focus of the}} mirrors or lenses changes (but also in these cases nonimaging optics provides the widest acceptance angles for a given concentration). Therefore, it seems unavoidable <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar photovoltaic a solar tracker is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.|$|E

Some of the photos showed naked bodies with blindfolds and hands tied behind their backs. They appear to have been executed. Al Jazeera could not verify the authenticity of the photographs. It had obtained them from Tamils who said they had obtained the photos from someone in the Sri Lankan military. The Sri Lankan government reacted by calling the photos lies and fabrications.

In the subsequent [...] "Venom War" [...] storyline, Venom confronts Jefferson at his home, where Spider-Man repels the creature.

By {{the end of the}} brawl, Marcus killed by police gunfire, as is Rio, who tells Miles not to reveal his secret to his father before dying. Miles quits being Spider-Man as a result. A year later he has a girlfriend named Katie Bishop, and is planning on telling her about his former life as Spider-Man. Though he has not engaged in heroics in a year, he is pressured to return to that life by S.H.I.E.L.D. He reluctantly does so, after Ganke and Spider-Woman convince him <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Spider-Man.

500|$|For season three, Mack {{wanted the}} {{character}} {{to be given}} a major obstacle to overcome, something that would help the character mature. The obstacle in question became Lionel's control over Chloe, after she made a deal to spy on Clark. Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the Torch, as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel's control to that of a [...] "caged animal". When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three's [...] "Truth", after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe's maturity; it is the moment that she realizes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a line she should never cross. After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe's acceptance of her place in Clark's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more [...] "genuine" [...] and [...] "selfless".|$|E
