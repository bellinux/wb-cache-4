5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such {{as child}} subsidies and cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> <b>In</b> addition, when developing policies related to paid work, {{it is important to}} do gender impact assessments in order {{to assess the impact of}} a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector.|$|E
5|$|As Toronto's suburbs {{began to}} {{encroach}} on the family's {{property in the}} late-1800s, Jesse's wife, Elizabeth, began subdividing the lot in 1893. A second storey in Second Empire style was added to <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> 1900, with a mansard roof, while maintaining the original veranda. The house was built {{to the east of}} the old frame home, which was demolished in 1913. Elizabeth continued to live in the home until her death in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Ben married Miriam Patterson of Omaha, Nebraska, on June 11, 1912. Both Boyce and {{his first}} wife {{attended}} the ceremony. At this time Boyce's first wife, Mary, exchanged some of her Chicago property for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa, which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might reconcile. The next year they remarried on June 14, 1913, in Ottawa. They then departed on a honeymoon to Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, Panama, and Cuba, with their daughter Happy, son Ben, and his wife Miriam.|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> case of an accident. This {{had a profound effect}} on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of â€œprivacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> this case was a trailer.|$|E

5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared {{with other members of the}} colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment outside <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same}} time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E

5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{completed}} in 1828, but not immediately occupied. Tayloe had a strong political disagreement with the newly elected President, Andrew Jackson, and refused {{to move into the}} home. Tayloe leased the building to Thomas Swann, Sr., a lawyer (and the father of Thomas Swann, Jr., who became Governor of Maryland in 1866). Swann vacated <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> November 1829, at which time Tayloe and his wife occupied it. The house was an important social gathering place for important Washingtonians in the four decades following its construction. In 1829, when Henry Clay left the office of Secretary of State, much of the furniture in his home was acquired by the Tayloes and used to decorate their home. Tayloe House was the last house in Washington visited by President William Henry Harrison before he death in 1841.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{the couple}} {{purchased}} a house together located on Burlington Crescent in Toronto, near Edith's clinic and lived there until their retirement. In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family in Burlington, Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with groups of women on camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in daily from Burlington to visit Williams. She died in 1979, after a series of additional strokes and Fraser returned to <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Burlington where she remained until three weeks before her death, when her family placed her in a nursing home.|$|E

5|$|Sashadhar Mukherjee, an {{assistant}} sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because {{both of them}} were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the household expenses for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things {{would never be the same}} between husband and wife again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode.|$|E
