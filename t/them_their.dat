5|$|Galileo {{initially}} {{named his}} discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius.

5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail cars for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among <b>them</b> <b>their</b> tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E
5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender.

The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After the Series, Ruth and {{teammates}} Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in a}} barnstorming tour in the Northeast.

Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined <b>them</b> <b>their</b> 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.|$|E

5|$|Ernuszt and {{his younger}} brother, John Ernuszt, made several {{attempts}} to regain the estates that Matthias Corvinus had confiscated from their father in the early 1470s.

Soon after, they leased the mines to John and George Thurzó for 10 years. They also regained Szklabonya (Sklabiná in Slovakia) from Anton Poki, a retainer of John Corvinus. The Ernuszt brothers, who held more than 3,500 peasant households, were among the wealthiest landowners in Hungary in 1494.|$|E
5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under {{instruction}} from their manager José Pastoriza, began {{to sit back}} in their own half inviting Liverpool to attack <b>them.</b> <b>Their</b> plan worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball.

5|$|German {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in North America in the mid-seventeenth century.

5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication.
