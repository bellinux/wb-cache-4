5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed amongst critics {{that the differences}} between these two passages represents authorial revision as opposed to faulty reporting, leading one <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of why Shakespeare removed the references to Salisbury, and why he wrote the preceding lines where Warwick re-introduces Montague as his brother. There is no definitive answer to this question, {{nor is there any}} {{answer to the question of}} why Shakespeare changed the character's name from Salisbury to Montague and then, after Act 1, equated him with another personage entirely.|$|E

[...] She was removed to the house of a Mr Bray, where on 14January, in the presence of two unidentified nobles, more knocking sounds were heard. [...] A few days later she was returned to Cock Lane, where on 18January another séance was held. [...] In attendance were Kent, the apothecary, and local parish priest and incumbent of St John Clerkenwell, Stephen Aldrich. [...] On that occasion, when a clergyman used a candle to look under the bed, the ghost [...] "refused" [...] to answer, Frazer claiming [...] "she [...] loving not light". [...] After a few minutes of silence the questioning continued, but when Moore asked if the ghost would appear in court against Kent, Frazer refused <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Peter Drucker was a {{prolific}} management theorist {{and author of}} dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. He addressed fundamental strategic questions in a 1954 book The Practice of Management writing: [...] "... the first responsibility of top management is <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> 'what is our business?' {{and to make sure}} it is carefully studied and correctly answered." [...] He wrote that the answer was determined by the customer. He recommended eight areas where objectives should be set, such as market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial resources, worker performance and attitude, profitability, manager performance and development, and public responsibility.|$|E

Drawing the rules in different Wolfram classes in these slices of the rule space show that class 1 rules tend to have lower number of bit-1's, thus located in one region of the space, whereas class 3 rules tend to have higher proportion (50%) of bit-1's.|$|E

2500|$|Although Fermi's name is most {{commonly}} associated with the paradox, {{he was not the}} first <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. He noted [...] "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" [...] because [...] "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence." [...] This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. [...] Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. That Tsiolkovsky himself {{may not have been the}} first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.|$|E
