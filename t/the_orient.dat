5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

Some reviewers of Murder on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express criticized the game because of the repetitive nature of tasks the player must complete, and also complained about the inefficient and cumbersome inventory system. Others have praised it for improved graphics compared to And Then There Were None, as well as convincing voice acting and audio effects.

40|$|Self-organization of {{nanoparticles}} is a {{major issue}} to synthesize mesoscopic structures. Among the possible mechanisms leading to self-organization, <b>the</b> <b>oriented</b> attachment is efficient yet not completely understood. We investigate here <b>the</b> <b>oriented</b> attachment process of ZnO nanocrystals preformed in the gas phase. During the deposition in high vacuum, about 60 % of the particles, which are uncapped, form larger crystals through <b>oriented</b> attachment. In <b>the</b> present conditions of deposition, no selective direction for <b>the</b> <b>oriented</b> attachment is noticed. To probe {{the driving force of}} <b>the</b> <b>oriented</b> attachment, and more specifically the possible influence of the dipolar interaction between particles, we have deposited the same nanocrystals {{in the presence of a}} constant electric field. The expected effect was to enhance the fraction of domains resulting from <b>the</b> <b>oriented</b> attachment due to the increased interaction of the particle dipoles with the electric field. The multiscale analytical and statistical analysis (TEM coupled to XRD) shows no significant influence of the electric field on the organization of the particles. We therefore conclude that the dipolar interaction between nanocrystals is not the prominent driving force in the process. Consequently, we argue, in accordance with recent theoretical and experimental investigations, that the surface reduction, possibly driven by Coulombic interaction, may be the major mechanism for <b>the</b> <b>oriented</b> attachment process...|$|R
5|$|The idea of <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express {{came from}} two sources: Fleming had {{returned}} from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew {{of the story of}} Eugene Karp and his journey on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{changes to}} the Turkish city of Istanbul ten years later. The game's protagonist, a devoted junior clerk at the Istanbul offices of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits, Antoinette Marceau, {{receives}} instructions from her employer Marcel Bouc, the Director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits, {{to attend to the}} wishes of his good friend Hercule Poirot. He tasks Marceau with ensuring that Poirot's journey on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express is favourable. Marceau begins her adventure in Sirkeci Terminal, Istanbul, where she becomes acquainted with Poirot, whom she admires, {{as well as the other}} characters who later accompany her aboard <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express.|$|E
5|$|The story centres on a plot by SMERSH, the Soviet {{counter-intelligence}} agency, {{to assassinate}} Bond {{in such a}} way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of The Sunday Times to report on an Interpol conference; he returned to Britain by <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express. From Russia, with Love deals with the East–West tensions of the Cold War, and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights) posthumously. Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the Cold War. The plot of From Russia, with Love uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had {{its roots in the}} wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot device of spies on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of <b>the</b> <b>Orient,</b> the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to <b>the</b> <b>Orient,</b> Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and <b>the</b> <b>Orient</b> was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E
