2500|$|Because newborn {{screening}} programs test {{for a number}} of different conditions, a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used, as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. [...] Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s. [...] With this <b>testing</b> <b>methodology,</b> {{newborn screening}} required one test to detect one condition. [...] As mass spectrometry became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot. [...] This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening. [...] Enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency. [...] Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. [...] Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The testing {{system was}} {{originally}} developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in Los Angeles during that era. Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures {{calculated from the}} test. [...] In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or UDDS) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports. In December 2006 the updated <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.|$|E

However, under the new NHTSA <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|E

40|$|Repeatable and {{accurate}} tests are important when designing hardware and algorithms for solar-powered {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). Since no two days are exactly alike with regard to energy harvesting, tests {{must be carried out}} indoors. Solar simulators are traditionally used in replicating the effects of sunlight indoors - however, solar simulators are expensive, have lighting elements that have short lifetimes, and are usually not designed to carry out the types of tests that hardware and algorithm designers require. As a result, hardware and algorithm designers use tests that are inaccurate and not repeatable (both for others and also for the designers themselves). In this article we propose an indoor <b>test</b> <b>methodology</b> which does not rely on solar simulators. The <b>test</b> <b>methodology</b> has its basis in astronomy and photovoltaic (PV) cell design.
