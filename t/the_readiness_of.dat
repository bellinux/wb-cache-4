5|$|As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was {{responsible}} to the First Lord for <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the fleet and {{the preparation of}} naval strategy, {{as well as the}} development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.|$|E
5|$|Generals Alfred Keller and Adolf Galland had {{scheduled}} {{an inspection}} at Achmer {{for the afternoon}} of 7November1944. Galland had already visited Kommando Nowotny several times and was deeply concerned over the high attrition rate and meager success achieved by the Me 262. After inspecting the two airfields at Achmer and Hesepe, {{he stayed in the}} Penterknapp barracks discussing the problems of the past few weeks. Several pilots openly expressed their doubts as to <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Me 262for combat operations.|$|E

Comments Romney made about <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press. Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E

5|$|SOE agent Richard Lippett had {{obtained}} employment with the shipping company John Holt & Co (Liverpool), which had business offices on the island. Having {{taken up the}} post he started to make preparations for the raid. He became aware that the crew of Duchessa d'Aosta were {{in the habit of}} accepting invitations to parties ashore and had held their own party aboard ship on 6 January 1942. Under the guise of a party-goer Lippett managed to gain information about <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the ship for sea, crew numbers, and the watch arrangements.|$|E
5|$|As AOC Training Command in 1954, Murdoch {{headed a}} program to {{determine}} aircraft purchases for the RAAF; his recommendations included the C-130 Hercules transport, {{considered one of the}} most important acquisitions in the Air Force's history. His term as CAS coincided with increased commitment to the Vietnam War, and he came into conflict with Australian Army commanders over the employment of helicopters in battle. He was also involved in assessing <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the General Dynamics F-111C for RAAF service. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1960 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966, Murdoch was the fourth in a series of CASs who had been cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. He retired from the Air Force in December 1969, and died in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Recent data show variations in <b>the</b> material <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> different types of ships, but do not reveal any clear trends of improvement or decline for the period from 2008 to 2012. The Navy uses a variety of means to collect, analyze, and track <b>the</b> material <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> its surface combatant and amphibious warfare ships. Three data sources the Navy uses to provide information on <b>the</b> material <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> ships are: casualty reports, which reflect equipment malfunctions; Defense Readiness Reporting System-Navy (DRRS-N) reports; and Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) material inspection reports. These data sources {{can be viewed as}} complementary, together providing data on both the current and life cycle material <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface force. INSURV and casualty report data show that <b>the</b> material <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> amphibious warfare ships is lower than that of frigates and destroyers. However, there is no clear upward or downward trend in material <b>readiness</b> across <b>the</b> entire Navy surface combatant and amphibious warfare ships. From 2010 to March 2012, INSURV data indicated a slight improvement in <b>the</b> material <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface combatant and amphibious warfare fleet, but over that period casualty reports from the ships increased, which would indicate a decline in material readiness. DRRS-N data also show differences in material readiness between ship types, but the precise differences are classified and therefore are not included in this report. ...|$|R

5|$|On 14August 1928, Wackett married Doreen Dove; {{the couple}} would have {{two sons and}} a daughter. In 1933, Wackett was posted to England to attend RAF Staff College, Andover. Returning to Australia, he was {{promoted}} squadron leader and became Director of Technical Services, an organisation within the RAAF's Supply Branch, in May 1935; the appointment made Wackett the Air Force's senior engineer. The same year, he {{took charge of the}} Resources Committee for Electrical Equipment, Scientific and Optical Instruments, one of several subcommittees on the federal government's Defence Resources Board set up to investigate and report on <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> Australian industry to provide munitions for defence in the event of international conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Texian {{army was}} {{a force of}} 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any {{military}} training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were {{not yet ready to}} engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just {{on the other side of}} the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, with {{demobilisation}} of Australia's wartime army complete, {{the decision}} was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions, an armoured brigade and various corps-level support units. During this time the 3rd Division was re-raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades—the 4th, 6th and 9th Brigades—it was once again based in central Victoria, although subunits were also based in South Australia and Tasmania. Once again the division's component units bore little resemblance to those that had fought with it during the two World Wars. Service in the post war CMF was initially on a voluntary basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Australian military during the Korean War. The 3rd Division was not deployed during this time, however, and although national service was instituted, service in Korea was undertaken on a voluntary basis, and conscription was used only as a means to expand the CMF and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{the number}} of active {{personnel}} remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited. After 1936, however, the Army attempted to improve the conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate the training program, while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns. Nevertheless, {{it was not until}} 1938, as tensions grew in Europe and the prospect of war became more likely, that an attempt was made to expand the establishment of the Militia. At this time an effort was made to determine <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Militia to expand if mobilised. During the continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938, each component unit was assessed with mixed results. The following year, 1939, saw further expansion {{and by the end of}} April of that year, the division's posted strength had grown to 9,589 personnel. As a part of this expansion, the divisional artillery was expanded by the re-raising of the batteries that had been disbanded in 1922.|$|E

25|$|While the Australian Government was {{reassured}} by Britain's {{assessment of the}} situation, the Allied military units stationed in Western Australia made preparations to resist a possible Japanese attack. The Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) Western Area Command improved <b>the</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> its forces stationed near Perth and Exmouth Gulf in the north-west of the state. It also stockpiled bombs at Cunderdin to the north-east of Perth for use by any heavy bombers sent as reinforcements. <b>The</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Army garrison units in the Fremantle-Perth area were also increased. The Fremantle Fortress command, which {{was responsible for the}} defence of the port against naval bombardment or air attack, was placed on alert and ordered to station additional heavy anti-aircraft guns near the city's docks. On 4 March the local Volunteer Defence Corps personnel were also ordered to be able to man their assigned anti-aircraft and coast defence positions within six hours, rather than the normal warning time of 24 hours.|$|E
