5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{at the age}} of 20, he {{was sent}} to the frontline, where he took {{photographs}} of life in the trenches with a lightweight camera (a Goerz Tenax). Most of these photographs were destroyed during <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Revolution of 1919. Wounded in 1915 by a bullet, Kertész suffered temporary paralysis of his left arm.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 1951, PFC Edward Gomez (1932–1951), an Ammunition Bearer in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, voluntarily {{moved down}} an {{abandoned}} trench {{to search for}} a new location for his machine gun and, when a hostile grenade landed between himself and his weapon, he shouted a warning to those around him as he grasped the activated charge in his hand. Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion in his own body.|$|E

5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, {{but during the}} course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suppression, the {{government}} and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued {{to be worried about}} fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|Lenin {{was back}} in Galicia when the First World War broke out, an {{international}} situation that he had paid little attention to. The war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to his Russian citizenship, Lenin was deemed a spy by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In August, they arrested him and imprisoned him in Nowy Targ, although they released him once his anti-tsarist credentials were explained. To escape <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern front, Lenin and his wife moved to neutral Switzerland, settling in Bern, although in February 1916 they moved to Zurich, which was cheaper. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party had supported the German war effort, thereby contravening the Stuttgart resolution of the Second International that all socialist parties would oppose the international conflict. As a result, Lenin saw the Second International as defunct. In particular, he denounced German Marxist Karl Kautsky for supporting the German Social-Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, {{and these were}} applied to the occupied and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied selectively due to {{the transfer of the}} territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in the occupied territories were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate, but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.|$|E
5|$|In {{over half}} of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action. In the rest he played {{a wide range of}} characters, {{included}} doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (The Virginian). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (A Farewell to Arms). During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (Mr. Deeds, Meet John Doe, and For Whom the Bell Tolls). In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (The Fountainhead and High Noon). In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (Friendly Persuasion and Man of the West). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.|$|E
5|$|It is {{distinguished}} by its position against the French absolute monarchy, support for religious tolerance, including for Jansenism, support for democratic reforms {{such as the}} introduction of parliaments, support for the American independence and the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. The newspaper preferred to praise the changes in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) more than those in France, criticizing <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution, and contrasting it with the peaceful transformation in Poland. This relative lack {{of support for the}} French Revolution may explain why the paper was abolished on 23 April 1798, three years after the invasion of the Netherlands by France and the Batavian Revolution. It reappeared as the Nouvelles politiques publiées à Leyde in October, but it was seen as no longer independent. Under a new name—Journal politique publié à Leyde—it lasted from 1804 until 1811, but it never regained its audience and its quality, and disappeared after the annexation of Holland by the French Empire. A new Leyden Gazette briefly appeared after the liberation of Holland in 1814.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> {{performance}} <b>of</b> Saddam 2 ̆ 7 s trial, which {{culminated in}} <b>the</b> executions <b>of</b> Saddam {{and two of}} his co-defendants, we find both lawmaking and law-preserving <b>violence</b> at work. <b>The</b> new Iraqi State exercised its law-preserving violence when sitting in judgement on Saddam 2 ̆ 7 s own acts <b>of</b> law-preserving <b>violence.</b> Yet <b>the</b> trial was also an affirmation of its own legitimacy on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new regime, a performance designed to justify and uphold <b>the</b> lawmaking <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi war. <b>The</b> <b>violences</b> <b>of</b> law, <b>the</b> <b>violences</b> which found and reinforce <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, are anchored in performance. There is a symbiotic relationship between <b>violence</b> and play; <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> law requires play, and hence <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> state <b>violence</b> against Saddam and his co-defendants occurred in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule-bound, orderly performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial. Yet other forms of play, other more spontaneous performances, can disrupt <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> defiant performances <b>of</b> Saddam and his co-defendants suggest that play can be a strategy for negotiating <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R

5|$|The Disasters of War (Spanish: Los desastres de la guerra) is {{a series}} of 82 prints created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and {{printmaker}} Francisco Goya (1746–1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808–14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. During the conflicts between Napoleon's French Empire and Spain, Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers. Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath. He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons. In total over a thousand sets have been printed, though later ones are of lower quality, and most print room collections have {{at least some of the}} set.|$|E
