50|$|The Yamaha RX100 was {{launched}} in the mid 80's in India, and was produced until 1996. With the failure of Yamaha RD350 {{and the success of}} Ind-Suzuki's AX-100 in the market and masses, Yamaha realized the potential of Smaller Displacement Bikes in India. The RX-100 {{was launched}} in India in late 1985 shortly after the Ind-Suzuki AX-100 and Hero Honda CD-100 were launched. Kawasaki launched KB-100 a little later, in early 1986. It {{was one of the most}} reliable and peppiest smaller displacement bikes of the time. It gave tough competition to almost all bikes of that time. Many could not believe that a 100 cc engine, as claimed by the manufacturers, could deliver such raw power; people actually spread the rumor that it had a much bigger engine. It was also said that many race conductors and authorities double checked by opening the engine block to make sure it was actually 100 CC. This mean machine was used in many chain snatching and robbery incidents by some antisocial elements, which led to the banning of this bike by the state governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Racers recognized the potential of RX's on dirt & drag Races. Various modifications like expansion chambers, porting, tuning, sprocketing, wheel sizes(16", 17", 18") and upgrades like bigger carburettors, air filters, quick <b>throttle,</b> <b>disc</b> brakes, 5th gear, race pistons, racing CDI systems, grippier tyres and suspension dampening were done to extract the maximum potential out of the bike in races.|$|E
2500|$|The 1968 model saw {{the effects}} of burgeoning U.S. safety and {{emissions}} legislation. [...] For example, from a safety perspective, dual system (aka tandem) brakes were introduced along with a brake failure warning device. [...] The engine's state of tune was attenuated with a milder camshaft and a distributor with idle speed ignition timing retarded to address emissions. [...] The twin SU carburettors now included overrun valves in the <b>throttle</b> <b>discs</b> and anti-tampering features on carburettor fuel-air mixture nuts.|$|R
5000|$|On November 19, 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment {{announced}} that they finished editing the first Blu-ray Disc, a full-length movie, Charlie's Angels: Full <b>Throttle.</b> The <b>disc</b> uses MPEG-2 compression at a resolution of 1920&times;1080 (it was not announced {{whether it will be}} 1080p or 1080i) and claims to use a menu interface that would succeed current DVD-Video interfaces.|$|R
