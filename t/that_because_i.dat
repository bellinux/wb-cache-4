But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Chabon {{argued against}} the idea that genre fiction and {{entertaining}} fiction should not appeal to [...] "the real writer," [...] saying that the common perception is that [...] "Entertainment ... means junk.... maybe {{the reason for the}} junkiness of so much of what pretends to entertain us is that we have accepted—indeed, we have helped to articulate—such a narrow, debased concept of entertainment....

She developed a strong character. At the beginning of season two, the producers approached Benz about character growth. They wanted to make Rita stronger and less shattered than she was in the first season. Benz has said that she was [...] "Very sad to hear <b>that.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> loved playing her in season one where she was this very damaged, fragile bird who was just struggling so hard to make a better world for her kids, but just could not do it." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|American singer Christina Aguilera rose to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: [...] "Genie in a Bottle", [...] "What a Girl Wants", and [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, [...] "The label [...] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me," [...] Aguilera said. [...] "I really wanted to squirm away from <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about." ...|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious."

500|$|Everton {{chairman}} David Marsh {{was disappointed}} {{with the introduction of}} football on Monday nights, as it disrupted [...] "the social life of British society and the fans." [...] Liverpool were also critical; when asked if the club would refuse to play games scheduled on that particular day, chief executive Peter Robinson replied: [...] "I cannot answer <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't know whether we would be contractually able to refuse." [...] Both Merseyside clubs offered its season ticket holders a refund for matches rescheduled for Monday nights, provided fans gave a seven-day notice. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said the prospect of playing on Sunday and Monday was a disadvantage to his and other clubs' chances in Europe. He called for an urgent discussion with other managers about the game's future: [...] "A deal was stampeded without consultation with the most important people in the game, the managers and the players whose livelihoods are at stake.... It's the most ludicrous and backward decision football has taken. We managers must seriously question its wisdom." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 22, 2011, Lee went to Liberty Studios in Toronto {{in order}} to preview five {{mastered}} songs from the band's studio album—including [...] "My Heart Is Broken"—to a selected crowd of thirty people. During an interview with MTV News, the group revealed that they wanted the song to be included on the soundtrack of movie , with drummer Will Hunt saying, [...] "I've been screaming for [...] 'My Heart Is Broken' to land in <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think it would fit the story so well. I got sucked into the 'Twilight' vortex by the girls at home, so by default, I've got to watch it." [...] However, the recording was not included on the soundtrack, subsequently premiering online on September 27, 2011, two weeks prior to the album's release. When interviewed by NME, Lee confirmed that the song was to be released as the second single from Evanescence. Following this, it was sent to pop, hot adult contemporary and Hot/Mod/AC radio stations in the United States on October 31, 2011.

500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, I said <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think you can do it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, the IMAX Corporation {{announced}} that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D. Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the [...] "Shawarma scene" [...] in The Avengers, explaining, [...] "It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else. Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else. Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it." [...] However, Feige clarified, [...] "There will be a tag [...] But there's not a post––credit scene." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day?

The exhibition also featured a series of embroidered texts and hand-woven tapestries which continued Emin's interest in domestic and handcrafted traditions. Emin herself has said that, [...] "I called it <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw part of myself as drying and not there anymore and I wanted to question the whole idea of love and passion, whether love exists anymore...Why?
