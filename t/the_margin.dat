Ithasthepotential todefinelesionmarginsbeforesurgical therapy. OBJECTIVES To {{investigate the}} feasibility of RCM in defining themargins of basal cell carcinoma before surgery. METHODS <b>The</b> <b>margins</b> of 10 lesions were evaluated using RCM. Biopsies of <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> were used to confirm the results. A protocol was constructed to define margins. RCM was used to delineate preoperative surgical margins in 13 patients. Intraoperative frozen biopsy was used to confirm <b>the</b> <b>margins.</b> RESULTS In seven of 10 (70. 0 %) cases, <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> of <b>the</b> cancer were identified suing RCM. The tumor island was the critical feature in identifying <b>the</b> <b>margins.</b> In 12 of 13 (92. 3 %) cases, frozen biopsy corroborated that <b>the</b> surgical <b>margins</b> delineated by RCM were clear. CONCLUSION RCM imaging of <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> is feasible and demonstrates the possibility of preoperative mapping of cancer <b>margins.</b> <b>The</b> authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

40|$|This paper {{troubles}} research {{approaches in}} practical theology by exploring how attention to lived experiences of marginalization in postcolonial feminist theologies shapes theological methodologies. Drawing {{on the work}} of Walter Mignolo and Marcella Althaus-Reid, <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> are explored as epistemological and material sites that shape theological knowledge production. The complex intersections of experiences and identities of lives on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> require a resistance to taxonomic or technical theological methodologies. As discussed by Mayra Rivera and Ada María Isasi-Díaz, <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> are not sites of deprivation, but of critical praxis, so theological methodology must be attentive to everyday experiences of <b>the</b> <b>margins.</b> <b>The</b> paper highlights where postcolonial feminist theologies add to practical theology about poetics by attending to making meaning. The paper concludes by reflecting on academic engagement with postcolonial feminist theology and the lived experiences of <b>the</b> <b>margins...</b>|$|R
