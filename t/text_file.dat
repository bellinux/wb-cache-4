5|$|References to the Mommsen text {{is based}} on the Project Gutenburg e-text edition of the books. References are {{therefore}} given in terms of line numbers within the <b>text</b> <b>file,</b> and not page numbers as would be the case with a physical book.|$|E
5|$|Users {{must have}} either found {{decryption}} keys themselves or obtained them elsewhere for most versions of BackupHDDVD to work. The utility reads a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> containing volume or title keys {{and attempts to}} find a set of corresponding keys for the inserted disc. Through a standard AES library, it then decrypts each video file on the disc using the appropriate keys and writes the results to a location specified by the user. Direct file decryption allows the utility's functionality to remain unaffected by device key revocation and its performance unencumbered with AACS overhead.|$|E

2500|$|Being {{certified}} Unix, macOS uses POSIX {{format for}} <b>text</b> <b>files.</b> Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) used for <b>text</b> <b>files</b> in macOS is [...] "public.plain-text"; additional, more specific UTIs are: [...] "public.utf8-plain-text" [...] for utf-8-encoded text, [...] "public.utf16-external-plain-text" [...] and [...] "public.utf16-plain-text" [...] for utf-16-encoded text and [...] "com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text" [...] for classic Mac OS <b>text</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the Windows NT-based {{versions}} of Windows, Notepad can edit traditional 8-bit <b>text</b> <b>files</b> {{as well as}} Unicode <b>text</b> <b>files</b> (both UTF-8 and UTF-16, and in case of UTF-16, both little-endian and big-endian).|$|R
25|$|There is no {{standard}} {{file extension}} for a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> containing FASTA formatted sequences. The {{table below shows}} each extension and its respective meaning.|$|E
25|$|As the headers only include {{printable}} ASCII {{characters and}} line feeds, an archive containing only text files therefore still {{appears to be}} a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|A simple <b>text</b> <b>file</b> {{needs no}} {{additional}} metadata {{to assist the}} reader in interpretation, and therefore may contain no data at all, which {{is a case of}} zero byte file.|$|E
50|$|Most phlogs are {{maintained}} by hand {{as a series}} of <b>text</b> <b>files.</b> Open source software exists to convert posts from a WordPress blog into plain <b>text</b> <b>files</b> that can be accessed using the gopher protocol.|$|R

5000|$|... '''''' is {{a command}} in Unix-like {{operating}} systems that merges {{the lines of}} two sorted <b>text</b> <b>files</b> based {{on the presence of}} a common field. It is similar to the join operator used in relational databases but operating on <b>text</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
25|$|F06, F06a: Run by Russian intelligence. This {{station is}} {{transmitted}} from many locations, including Moscow, Eastern Russia, and Cuba. The variant, with no schedule, sends an ASCII <b>text</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arch Linux, {{a rolling}} release {{distribution}} targeted at experienced Linux users and maintained by a volunteer community, offers official binary packages {{and a wide}} range of unofficial user-submitted source packages. Packages are usually defined by a single PKGBUILD <b>text</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reference}} implementation assumes that TTM {{is given a}} <b>text</b> <b>file</b> containing some combination of ordinary text and TTM function calls (i.e. invocations). The text is scanned character by character. Any ordinary text is passed to the output unchanged (except for escapes).|$|E
50|$|Concatenation of text {{is limited}} to <b>text</b> <b>files</b> using the same legacy encoding, such as ASCII. cat {{does not provide a}} way to {{concatenate}} Unicode <b>text</b> <b>files</b> that have a Byte Order Mark or <b>files</b> using different <b>text</b> encodings from each other.|$|R
5000|$|Unicode <b>text</b> <b>files</b> {{encoded in}} UTF-16 often {{start with the}} Byte Order Mark to detect endianness ( [...] for big endian and [...] for little endian). And on Microsoft Windows, UTF-8 <b>text</b> <b>files</b> often start with the UTF-8 {{encoding}} of the same character, [...]|$|R
50|$|In practice, Darwin Core decouples the {{definition}} and semantics of individual terms from {{application of these}} terms in different technologies such as XML, RDF or simple CSV <b>text</b> <b>files.</b> Darwin Core provides separate guidelines on how to encode the terms as XML or <b>text</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
25|$|On Unix-like {{operating}} systems text files format is precisely described: POSIX defines a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> as a file that contains characters organized into zero or more lines, where lines are sequences of zero or more non-newline characters plus a terminating newline character, normally LF.|$|E
25|$|Because many {{encodings}} {{have only}} a limited repertoire of characters, they are often only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode {{is an attempt to}} create a common standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every ASCII <b>text</b> <b>file</b> is also a UTF-8 <b>text</b> <b>file</b> with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily auto-detectable. Thus, a common operating mode of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of unknown encoding, is to try UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when it definitely isn't UTF-8.|$|E
25|$|Stream: A stream, mainly {{used in a}} RecordSet object, is a {{means of}} reading and writing a stream of bytes. It is mostly used to save a {{recordset}} in an XML format, to send commands to an OLE DB provider {{as an alternative to the}} CommandText object and to contain the contents of a binary or <b>text</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
50|$|T4 {{is used by}} {{developers}} as part of {{an application}} or tool framework to automate the creation of <b>text</b> <b>files</b> with a variety of parameters. These <b>text</b> <b>files</b> can ultimately be any text format, such as code (for example C#), XML, HTML or XAML.|$|R

25|$|MS-DOS and Windows use {{a common}} <b>text</b> <b>file</b> format, with each line of text {{separated}} by a two-character combination: carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). It is common for {{the last line of}} text not to be terminated with a CR-LF marker, and many text editors (including Notepad) do not automatically insert one on the last line.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of this code {{is to be}} a bridge between a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> with a story and the code being tested. Note that the test code has access to the code being tested (in this case an instance of Game) and is very simple in nature. The test code has to be simple, otherwise a developer would end up having to write tests for his tests.|$|E
25|$|Using a simpler, {{more memorable}} name {{in place of}} a host's {{numerical}} address dates back to the ARPANET era. The Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) maintained a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> named HOSTS.TXT that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET. Maintenance of numerical addresses, called the Assigned Numbers List, was handled by Jon Postel at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.|$|E
50|$|A {{document}} writer application may {{support a}} multitude of files, ranging from simple <b>text</b> <b>files</b> that only store characters and not font faces or sizes, to complex documents containing text effects and images. However, when these <b>text</b> <b>files</b> or documents are opened, they are not necessarily edited in their original format.|$|R
5000|$|... uXu, Underground eXperts United (1991 - 2002), was an {{underground}} ezine written in Sweden by ex-members of the Swedish Hackers Association. It was written ASCII <b>text</b> <b>files,</b> influenced by cDc. When the group folded they had written and published 617 <b>text</b> <b>files</b> in English {{and more than}} 100 in Swedish.|$|R

25|$|When {{opened by}} a text editor, human-readable content is {{presented}} to the user. This often consists of the file's plain text visible to the user. Depending on the application, control codes may be rendered either as literal instructions acted upon by the editor, or as visible escape characters that can be edited as plain text. Though there may be plain text in a <b>text</b> <b>file,</b> control characters within the file (especially the end-of-file character) can render the plain text unseen by a particular method.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 2006, AOL {{released}} a compressed <b>text</b> <b>file</b> {{on one of}} its websites containing 20 million search keywords for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled A Picture of Search was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{common mistake}} of early FTP administrators was to permit a {{directory}} named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain <b>text</b> <b>file</b> with the message inside.|$|E
