40|$|Abstract — The goal of {{this paper}} is to present the design and {{development}} of a low cost <b>cargo</b> <b>transit</b> system which can be adapted in developing countries like India where there is abundant and cheap human labour which makes the process of automation in any industry a challenge to innovators. The need of the hour is an automation system that can diligently transfer cargo from one place to another and minimize human intervention in the <b>cargo</b> <b>transit</b> industry. Therefore, a solution is being proposed which could effectively bring down human labour and the resources needed to implement them. The reduction in human labour and resources is achieved by the use of low cost components and very limited modification of the surroundings and the existing vehicles themselves. The operation of the <b>cargo</b> <b>transit</b> system has been verified and the relevant results are presented.

50|$|Foodstuffs still {{accounted}} {{for the majority of}} cargo passing through Koper. In 1967, the total throughput of tropical fruit amounted to 113,000 tonnes, which placed it top of the list of Yugoslav ports handling such perishables. There was also an increase in <b>transit</b> <b>cargo,</b> in particular for Czechoslovakia (140,572 tonnes), Hungary (49,645 tonnes), West Germany (47,592 tonnes), Austria (15,039 tonnes), Italy (11,369 tonnes), Switzerland (1,680 tonnes), as well as Bulgaria, Romania and the USSR (with an aggregate total of 12,479 tonnes). Between 1968 and 1977 the development of the Port of Koper was exclusively dependent on indigenous resources, namely the company's own profits and raised loans. A high degree of indebtedness in conjunction with rapid development led to a number of economic and operational difficulties.|$|E

50|$|Muuga Harbour (Muuga sadam) is {{the largest}} cargo port in Estonia, located on the {{southern}} coast of the Gulf of Finland, 13 km northeast of the capital Tallinn, in Maardu. The harbour is administrated by Port of Tallinn, the biggest port authority in Estonia. Muuga Harbour {{is one of the}} few ice-free ports in northernmost Europe and among the deepest (up to 18 m) and most modern ports in the Baltic Sea region. The cargo volume handled accounts for around 80% of the total cargo volume of Port of Tallinn and approximately 90% of the <b>transit</b> <b>cargo</b> volume passing through Estonia. Nearly 3/4 of cargo loaded in Muuga Harbour includes crude oil and oil products, but the harbour also serves dry bulk (mostly fertilizers, grain and coal) and other types of cargo.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{principal}} port of Tanzania and handles 90% of the countries cargo traffic. The port {{is divided into two}} parts (TICTS and TPA), to increase efficiency and encourage new challenges to the local port operators the TPA has authorised TICTS privately owned by Hong Kong investors to receive and clear cargo at the port. The Port also provides a vital transit point for cargo from multiple neighbouring landlocked countries. Almost 35 percent of all cargo moving through the port is <b>transit</b> <b>cargo.</b> The port is connected to two railways the Tanzania Central Railway and the TAZARA Railway, however the railways have been depreciating in reliability. The majority of the cargo moves out by road and has been a major bottleneck in expansion plans due to the weak road infrastructure of the city.Major expansion projects have been set in place to increase the capacity and efficiency of the port. After the construction of the Kigamboni bridge in the city the port plans to create more berths in Kigamboni. Furthermore, the construction of the Bagamoyo mega port has also begun set to help take the load off in 2018.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd's Coffee House was {{the first}} marine {{insurance}} market. It became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led {{to the establishment of}} the insurance market Lloyd's of London and several related shipping and insurance businesses. The participating members of the insurance arrangement eventually formed a committee and moved to the Royal Exchange on Cornhill as the Society of Lloyd's. The establishment of insurance companies, a developing infrastructure of specialists (such as shipbrokers, admiralty lawyers, bankers, surveyors, loss adjusters, general average adjusters, et al.), and the growth of the British Empire gave English law a prominence in this area which it largely maintains and forms the basis of almost all modern practice. Lord Mansfield, Lord Chief Justice in the mid-eighteenth century, began the merging of law merchant and common law principles. The growth of the London insurance market led to the standardization of policies and judicial precedent further developed marine insurance law. In 1906 the Marine Insurance Act codified the previous common law; it is both an extremely thorough and concise piece of work. Although the title of the Act refers to marine insurance, the general principles have been applied to all non-life insurance. In the 19th century, Lloyd's and the Institute of London Underwriters (a grouping of London company insurers) developed between them standardized clauses for the use of marine insurance, and these have been maintained since. These are known as the Institute Clauses because the Institute covered the cost of their publication. Out of marine insurance, grew non-marine insurance and reinsurance. Marine insurance traditionally formed the majority of business underwritten at Lloyd's. Nowadays, Marine insurance is often grouped with Aviation and <b>Transit</b> (<b>cargo)</b> risks, and in this form is known by the acronym 'MAT'.|$|E

40|$|A similar {{approach}} to analyze protein trafficking arrives at two opposing models of movement through the cell’s secretory pathway. The Golgi—a series of flattened membrane sacs (cisternae) —lies at {{the hub of}} a eukaryotic cell’s endomembrane system. The routes taken by <b>transiting</b> <b>cargo</b> and the Golgi’s resident enzymes have {{been a matter of}} long-standing controversy. The two most popular models—stable cister-nae versus cisternal maturation—have attracted support and criticism in almost equal measure (1). Two recent papers, aimed at providing a deci-sive answer for one of the models, instead offer conflicting interpreta-tions of similar data. For the stable cisternae model, Golgi cisternae are viewed as static structures containing resident enzymes that modify anterograde-transiting cargo. Transport between cisternae is typically carried out by COPI vesicles (COPI is the specific protein complex that coats these vesicles). Hence, cargo moves but the enzymes stay, though there will b...|$|R

In this paper, we study space allocation under these conditions. We reduce the problem to a two-dimensional packing problem with a time dimension. Since the problem is NP-hard, we develop heuristic algorithms, using tabu search, simulated annealing, a genetic algorithm and `squeaky wheel' optimization, as solution approaches. Extensive computational experiments compare the algorithms, which are shown to be effective for the problem...|$|E
40|$|With {{its present}} borders, Russia faces severe {{limitations}} in port capacity {{in relation to}} the demand of the domestic industry and raw material producers. The Baltic states possess, on the other hand, a port capacity that vastly exceeds local demand and continues to attract large volumes of Russian <b>transit</b> <b>cargo.</b> In this paper, existing Russian ports on the Baltic Sea are described along with a number of proposed port projects in the Gulf of Finland. Future large scale development of new Russian port capacity has long been considered unlikely, but political changes and rising oil prices have much increased the likelihood of one, or several, of these projects being realised. Probably, however, these projects are still not feasible from an economic point of view, and Russia will have to largely depend upon the port-sector of the Baltic states.

40|$|North-eastern Estonia and its centre, {{the town}} of Narva, had {{traditionally}} been a significant centre for industry and <b>transit</b> <b>cargo</b> between Russia and the West. The region's contribution to national output had been substantial. During World War II, Narva was virtually destroyed. The policies of the Soviet era, which led to over-industrialisation and over-urbanisation, transformed this historical Estonian town into a typical Soviet settlement with a predominantly Russian population. The legacies of the Soviet era left post-Soviet North-eastern Estonia and Narva overpopulated and overindustrialised. Since regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has undergone dramatic economic, political, and social changes. The subsequent restructuring of the country’s economy and the neo-liberal economic policies of the successive Estonian governments have adversely affected the development of North-eastern Estonia. Unemployment, ethnic problems, isolation {{from the rest of}} the country and widespread urban poverty are all parts of contemporary life in this underdeveloped region. This paper examines the econo-geographical consequences of North-eastern Estonia’s transformation from a centrally plan economy to a freemarket economy with particular reference to their impacts on the urban area of Narva.

40|$|One of the {{peculiarities of}} the {{liability}} of the transport operator under the contract of <b>transit</b> of the <b>cargo</b> is in the presence in such a relationship of necessary pre-action procedure of disputes prior to recourse of the consignor or consignee to the court for protection of their violated rights. Compliance with the complaint procedure is carried out by requiring the transport operator the claims by the consignor or consignee. The general rule about the presence in relations of the <b>transit</b> of <b>cargo</b> of mandatory complaint procedure is established in the Civil code of the Russian Federation, at the same time, a more detailed regulation of the complaint procedure, namely {{the direction of the}} claim, the timing of consideration of the consequences of refusal in satisfaction of requirements shall is determined by transportation rules and codes, which leads to differentiated legal regulation of relations on the complaint procedure on the settlement of disputes in the sphere of cargo transportation. Despite the fact that the complaint procedure on the settlement of disputes plays a significant role in social relations, in the legislation of the Russian Federation there is no developed mechanism to encourage voluntary compliance, which leads to {{the fact that in the}} Russian practice complaint procedure is regarded rather as an additional encumbrance to the person whose rights were violated in the process of <b>transit</b> of <b>cargo...</b>|$|R
