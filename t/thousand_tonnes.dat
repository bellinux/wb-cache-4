5|$|Like most of India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> and rice production was 610 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes,</b> while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes.</b> As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is most {{commonly}} used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (coating of iron or steel) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
50|$|Estimates of {{the current}} annual world {{production}} of frankincense vary, but generally are around several <b>thousands</b> <b>tonnes.</b> More than 82% of the product comes from Somalia, with some frankincense also gathered in adjacent Southern Arabia and Ethiopia, Sudan, and other central African countries.|$|R
50|$|Its {{establishment}} amid Provallya steppe, Chervonopartyzansk is owed {{primarily to}} Soviet geologists who in 1930s discovered here large deposits of anthracite. The first mine #63 was built during the World War II (1944) and in 1947 there was founded a large coal-mining company, Chervonyi Partyzan Mine. Its projected capacity was 2.5 <b>thousands</b> <b>tonnes</b> of fossil fuel per day. In 1949-1955 next to Chervonyi Partyzan, there were built less powerful mines Provallya #1 and Provallya #2. In 1956 {{all of the}} mines yielded 2.3 <b>thousands</b> of <b>tonnes</b> of anthracite or 16.3% of total extraction by mines of the Sverdlovskvuhillya corporation.|$|R

25|$|The {{total amount}} of helium-3 in the mantle {{may be in the}} range of 0.1–1 million tonnes. However, most of the mantle is not {{directly}} accessible. Some helium-3 leaks up through deep-sourced hotspot volcanoes such as those of the Hawaiian Islands, but only 300grams per year is emitted to the atmosphere. Mid-ocean ridges emit another 3 kilogram per year. Around subduction zones, various sources produce helium-3 in natural gas deposits which possibly contain a <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of helium-3 (although there may be 25 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> if all ancient subduction zones have such deposits). Wittenberg estimated that United States crustal natural gas sources may have only half a tonne total. Wittenberg cited Anderson's estimate of another 1200 metric tonnes in interplanetary dust particles on the ocean floors. In the 1994 study, extracting helium-3 from these sources consumes more energy than fusion would release.|$|E
25|$|Off Japan, the {{collision}} of the Oyashio Current with the Kuroshio Current produces nutrient-rich upwellings. Cyclic changes in these currents resulted in {{a decline in the}} sardine sardinops melanosticta populations. Fisheries catches fell from 5 million tonnes in 1988 to 280 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> in 1998. As a further consequence, Pacific bluefin tuna stopped moving into the region to feed.|$|E

25|$|Sulfur dioxide is {{primarily}} produced for sulfuric acid manufacture (see contact process). In the United States in 1979, 23.6 million tonnes {{of sulfur dioxide}} were used in this way, compared with 150 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> used for other purposes. Most sulfur dioxide is produced by the combustion of elemental sulfur. Some sulfur dioxide is also produced by roasting pyrite and other sulfide ores in air.|$|E
25|$|Although glycine can be {{isolated}} from hydrolyzed protein, {{this is not}} used for industrial production, {{as it can be}} manufactured more conveniently by chemical synthesis. The two main processes are amination of chloroacetic acid with ammonia, giving glycine and ammonium chloride, and the Strecker amino acid synthesis, which is the main synthetic method in the United States and Japan. About 15 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> are produced annually in this way.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{development}} {{areas for}} freshwater aquaculture include 960,000 hectares of agricultural water bodies, 143,000 hectares of ponds, plus other areas in big lakes and water reservoirs suitable for cage farming. The National Project on Agricultural Sector development (Federal Agency of Fishery, 2006) {{has set a}} target for 2020 of 1.4 million tonnes from freshwater aquaculture and 400 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> from mariculture.

25|$|Krill catch {{increased}} rapidly. In the 1980s, a few additional nations started {{operating in}} the area: Poland, Chile, and South Korea. Their catches amounted to a few <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> annually; the lion's share went to the Soviet Union, followed by Japan. A peak in krill harvest was reached in 1982 with a total production of over 528,000 tonnes, of which the Soviet Union produced 93%. In the following two years, production declined. It is unclear whether {{this was due to}} the discovery of fluorides in the krill's exoskeleton or to marketing problems. The trade recovered quickly, though, and reached more than 400,000 tonnes again in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Rouble-denominated oil-trading {{exchange}} in Russia: proposed in February 2006.

For March, the auction volume amounts to 15–20 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of oil products monthly. Besides Rosneft, other major Russian oil companies like Gazprom Oil, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas, and TNK-BP also plan to go to the exchange, and crude oil trade is expected to start in a few months.|$|E
25|$|The late 17th-century {{discoveries of}} gold and diamond {{deposits}} in Brazil {{were the most important}} such finds ever made in the colonial New World. Between 1700 and 1800 a thousand metric tonnes of gold were recorded as received by the Portuguese treasury, and another <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> may have evaded the royal fifth. Around 2.4 million carats of diamonds were extracted from the alluvial sources in Minas Gerais, while an unknown amount was smuggled out. These riches had a great economic impact there and in the mother country, encouraging large numbers of Portuguese to emigrate to the colony and giving it a more European character. Many of the settlers found their way to the gold-bearing region in the Atlantic Forest {Mata Atlântica}, where they could become prosperous enough to buy African slaves.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{violence}} in the Aïr Massif, Areva NC and the Nigerien government were, by late 2008, unhindered in their exploitation of the Arlit uranium mines and in the transport of uranium by highway to ports in Benin. At the beginning of 2009, Niger and the French state mining company agreed on a deal to build the Imouraren mine near Arlit. At a projected output of five <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of ore a year, it would be largest uranium mine in the world by 2012, as the SOMAIR and COMINAK mines were to be phased out. The deal would make Niger the second largest uranium producer in the world, and included plans to construct a civil nuclear power station for Niger. While Areva officials earlier in the year admitted that the security situation made it impossible to prospect at night, and that the fighting had frightened off prospecting for new sites, the operations of the mines were, by December, unaffected by the Tuareg rebellion. Despite the awarding of nearly 100 prospecting contracts to firms other than Areva in 2007, the high-profile Chinese and Canadian projects were not yet formalised as of 2009.|$|E
