5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that her life was threatened and although the prosecutors requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, the prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that there was no reason to show any leniency to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. The prosecutors also claim that it was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decree}} of election, {{those who had}} chosen him as Bishop of Rome proclaimed Gregory VII “a devout man, a man mighty in human and divine knowledge, a {{distinguished}} lover of equity and justice, a man firm in adversity and temperate in prosperity, a man, according to the saying of the Apostle, of good behavior, blameless, modest, sober, chaste, given to hospitality, and one that ruleth well his own house; a man from his childhood generously {{brought up in the}} bosom of this Mother Church, and for the merit of his life already raised to the archidiaconal dignity”. “We choose then”, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> the people, “our Archdeacon Hildebrand to be pope and successor to the Apostle, and to bear henceforward and forever the name of Gregory” (22 April 1073).|$|E

25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|According to Pasternak, {{during the}} 1937 show trial of General Iona Yakir and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the Union of Soviet Writers {{requested}} all members to add {{their names to}} a statement supporting {{the death penalty for}} the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. Vladimir Stavski, the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at Peredelkino and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his dacha. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an NKVD agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E
25|$|This {{distinction}} had {{implications for}} New Divinity preaching and evangelism that were departures from traditional Puritan beliefs. For the Puritans, conversion was a gradual process involving spiritual crises, humiliation, and sorrow for sin. Only after these struggles and utilizing {{the means of}} grace (prayer, seeking God, reading the Bible, and attending church) would the individual discern within himself faith and love for Christ and be encouraged to repent. New Divinity ministers, however, called all sinners to repent and believe the gospel immediately because everyone had the natural ability to do so. There was no reason, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> wait for any period of conviction and spiritual struggle. While immediate repentance was criticized by Old Calvinists, there was practically little {{difference between the two}} approaches. When asked how to repent, Old Calvinists and New Divinity ministers had the same advice: seek God through the means of grace and in time God might give the seeker new affections and inclinations to believe in Christ.|$|E

25|$|Although GM {{since the}} 1920s has always offered economy {{models in the}} U.S. market (relative to that market's {{definition}} in any given decade), and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the U.S. market, {{it has also been}} criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the U.S. market in the 1970s through 1990s. GM's response has been that it has always responded to market demands, and that most Americans, despite anything <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> the contrary, did not actually demand (at purchasing-decision time) small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent. Although some U.S. consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose (such as 1973 and 1979), they flocked equally enthusiastically to SUVs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices.|$|E

If a town were overcome by besieging troops, all women of priestly stock found in it are ineligible , but if they had witnesses, even a slave, or even a bondswoman, these may be believed. But no man may be believed for himself.

Rav Judah said in Rav's name that the ministering angels knew that Sarah was in the tent, but they brought out {{the fact that she was}} in the tent to make her more beloved to Abraham (by impressing him with her modesty). Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Hanina said that they brought out the fact that she was in the tent to send her the wine-cup of benediction.

2500|$|What is {{the meaning}} of [...] "Acher {{destroyed}} the plants"? Of him scripture says: [...] "Do not let your mouth make your flesh sin". What does this mean? Acher saw that Metatron happened to be granted authority to sit while he record the merits of Israel, and he said: [...] "We have been taught that in heaven there is no sitting.... Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Metatron: [...] "When you saw him, why did you not stand up before him?"

Thomson, common in the East. [...] "The Lord be with you is merely the [...] "Allah makum!" [...] of ordinary parlance; and so too the response, The Lord bless thee" [...] ('The Land and the Book,' p.648). Modern Moslems are particular {{in the matter of}} salutations.

2500|$|Author Yoshihiro Togashi {{explained}} {{that one of}} his hobbies is collecting objects of all sorts, so he was inspired to create a manga involving collecting titled [...] "Hunter". He came up with the final name Hunter × Hunter while watching the television variety show Downtown, in which the hosts often repeated what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> make the audience laugh. The [...] "×" [...] in the title is silent. As with his previous series, YuYu Hakusho, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color them. Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga's production; however, fellow manga artist and future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first volume. With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga's theme of a young boy searching for his father.|$|E
