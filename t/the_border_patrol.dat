25|$|The Kingdom of Thailand {{occupied}} a delicate position during the Second Indochina War.

As a result, there was a consensus among Thais that communist encroachment should be stopped short of Thai territory. As an open effort would attract Chinese attention, the Thai government elected covert participation in the ongoing Laotian Civil War.

25|$|In 1992, the Luftwaffe {{began to}} phase out their Alpha Jet A aircraft, reserving 45 for lead-in fighter training. In 1993, a total of 50 were passed on to Portugal to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon and Fiat G.91 fleets, with five of these used for spares. The rest of the Luftwaffe's Alpha Jets were {{gradually}} phased out, the last leaving service in 1998, and customers were sought to buy them. In October 1995, the German military offered 42 Alpha Jets to Poland for 143 million PLN. In 1999, 25 Alpha Jets were sold to Thailand at 1 million baht ($27,000) each, replacing the North American OV-10 Bronco in <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> role; while the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency obtained 12 as chase aircraft and flight test platforms due to a shortage in available BAE Systems Hawk aircraft for the role.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> mission {{started with}} DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both {{eventually}} replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most {{of the first}} planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it no easy task to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could not do that very well. Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men had to fly was wild and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.|$|E

25|$|According to the Dhërmi police post's chief, V. Kordhishta, at 17:40 his {{superiors}} were notified about the watercraft seen on radar, moving {{away at a}} mere 200 m from the shore.

At 18:30, the radar in Vlorë tracked two watercraft, 3 miles off Karaburun's coast, publicly confirmed by a spokesman of the Ministry of Order during a transmission on Top-Channel. At 18:40 a patrol boat of the Delta Force unit, an inflatable dinghy of <b>the</b> <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> and another patrol boat set off toward Dhermi. Due to the bad weather they could not progress beyond Mezokanal between Sazan Island and Karaburun Peninsula and docked in Shën Jan bay, near Cape of Gjuhëz.

500|$|According to Delić, at 05:45 on {{the morning}} of April 23, {{soldiers}} of the 53rd Border Battalion of the 549th Motorized Brigade encountered a group of 150–200 militants near the Košare outpost attempting to illegally enter Kosovo via northern Albania, just west of Dečani. Rebels had been massing at the Albanian–Yugoslav border for some time in anticipation of a renewed VJ offensive. Yugoslav authorities stated that the militants were [...] "armed infiltrators" [...] who had been undergoing training in military camps in Albania, and were attempting to smuggle weapons into Kosovo. According to Delić, <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> was greatly outnumbered by the militants. Armed with howitzers and rocket launchers, the patrol ambushed the armed group, sparking an intense exchange of fire. Clashes reportedly lasted all night, and the Kosovo Albanian residents of the border village of Batuša reported artillery fire and helicopters flying overhead the following day.|$|E

500|$|From 1945 onwards, {{unauthorised}} crossers of {{the inner}} German border risked being shot by Soviet or East German guards. The use of deadly force was termed the Schießbefehl ("order to fire" [...] or [...] "command to shoot"). It was formally in force as early as 1948, when regulations concerning the use of firearms on the border were promulgated. A regulation issued to East German police on 27May 1952 stipulated that [...] "failure to obey the orders of <b>the</b> <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> will be met {{by the use of}} arms". From the 1960s through {{to the end of the}} 1980s, the border guards were given daily verbal orders (Vergatterung) to [...] "track down, arrest or annihilate violators". The GDR formally codified its regulations on the use of deadly force in March 1982, when the State Border Law mandated that firearms were to be used as the [...] "maximum measure in the use of force" [...] against individuals who [...] "publicly attempt to break through the state border".|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{surviving}} militants either retreated to Albania or went into hiding along the border. As they fled, they dropped large quantities of Chinese-made weapons and munitions, which were subsequently seized by Yugoslav authorities. Six militants, all citizens of Albania, were captured. They were charged with illegally crossing the border and gunrunning. Yugoslav officials stated that more than [...] of weapons and ammunition, including about 300 rifles, 60 machine guns, ten recoilless guns {{and a number of}} mortars had been confiscated. Later that day, the VJ shelled a known arms trafficking route near the site of the ambush, wounding 19 KLA fighters. The militants were rescued by Albanian border guards and airlifted by helicopter to receive treatment in a Tirana hospital. At 13:30, two militants opened fire on a Yugoslav border patrol within [...] of the Albanian frontier. <b>The</b> <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> returned fire, and the militants fled to Albania.

500|$|During {{its service}} in the Yugoslav Navy, Mukos was part of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> detachment. In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos {{was part of the}} [...] "Kaštela" [...] {{tactical}} group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the port of Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Brač and Šolta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy (HRM), effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The HRM command constructed the torpedo from a small outboard motor boat loaded with explosives. A former missile technician from the Yugoslavian navy had, while receiving training on Saab missiles in Sweden, picked up some remote control plane parts in a hobby store. Handed over to HRM, the gear yielded the ability to remotely control the unmanned vessel. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to flood and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a Shershen-class torpedo boat Pionir II (TČ-224) while Mukos itself was left adrift.|$|E
