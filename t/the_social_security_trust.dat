25|$|The non-marketable {{securities}} represent amounts owed to program beneficiaries. For example, {{in the case}} of <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund, the payroll taxes dedicated to Social Security were credited to the Trust Fund upon receipt, but spent for other purposes.

Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare).|$|E

50|$|There is debate {{regarding}} the economic {{nature of the}} intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6 trillion in February 2011. A {{significant portion of the}} intragovernmental debt is <b>the</b> $2.6 trillion <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund.|$|R
25|$|The Social Security Advisory Board has {{on three}} {{occasions}} since 1999 appointed a Technical Advisory Panel {{to review the}} methods and assumptions used in the annual projections for <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds. The most recent report of the Technical Advisory Panel, released in June 2008 with a copyright date of October 2007, includes a number of recommendations for improving the Social Security projections.|$|E
25|$|Debt held by {{government}} accounts or intragovernmental debt, such as non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts {{administered by the}} federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries, such as <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund. Debt held {{by government}} accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities. Since 2016, this has comprised one-third of the US debt and originates from federal governmental spending in the form of mandatory spending programs,discretionary spending programs and unpaid interest the government owes to creditors.|$|E
25|$|The Social Security Administration's {{authority}} to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends {{in part on the}} federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.|$|E
50|$|It is {{expected}} that {{the aging of the}} baby boomer generation in the US will increase the demand for this type of instrument and for it to be optimized for the annuitant. This growing market will drive improvements necessitating more research and development of instruments and increase insight into the mechanics involved {{on the part of the}} buying public. An example of increased scrutiny and discussion is that related to privatization of part of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund.|$|R
25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> {{is funded}} {{primarily}} through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are {{collected by the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance <b>Trust</b> Fund, <b>the</b> two <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Funds. With a few exceptions, all salaried income, up to an amount specifically determined by law (see tax rate table below), is subject to <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> payroll tax. All income over said amount is not taxed. In 2017, {{the maximum amount of}} taxable earnings was $127,200.|$|R
50|$|The United States turns {{its massive}} {{offensive}} military into {{a much smaller}} force, switching its priorities to domestic matters, beginning with using the U.S. military budget to fill <b>the</b> gap in <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> <b>trust</b> fund left there by past congresses and presidents who spent the money on other things, and continuing onward in the same theme.|$|R
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. GAO {{reported that}} even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined. Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. As described above, roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6-8 trillion adjusting for {{the extension of}} the Bush tax cuts and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended the Bush tax cuts for approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1–2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund) rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP in 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era.|$|E
25|$|In {{social welfare}} programs, the Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT), Social Security Administration plans and directs {{a program of}} actuarial {{estimates}} and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality, morbidity, utilization, retirement, disability, survivorship, marriage, unemployment, poverty, old age, families with children, etc., and projects future workloads. In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The Office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the Board of Trustees of <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.|$|E
5000|$|The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, however changed this so that <b>the</b> two <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Funds, and <b>the</b> {{operations}} of the Postal Service, {{are considered to be}} 'off-budget' and are excluded from the unified budget. [...] This means that <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> Tax is not counted as revenue to the General Fund, and interest paid to the Trust Funds is counted as an expense to an external entity. Often Federal budget reports will contain two sets of numbers for the yearly Federal Budget: an 'off-budget' deficit (or surplus) and an 'on-budget' deficit (or surplus) the former of course including the receipts and outlays of these budgets, but by law for purposes of balancing the budget they are 'off-budget'.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{adopted a}} unified {{budget in the}} Johnson administration in 1968. This change resulted in a single measure of the fiscal status of the government, based on {{the sum of all}} government activity. <b>The</b> surplus in <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds offsets <b>the</b> total debt, making it appear much smaller than it otherwise would. This allowed Congress to increase spending without having to risk the political consequences of raising taxes.|$|R

25|$|The 2011 {{annual report}} by the program's Board of Trustees noted the following: in 2010, 54 million people were {{receiving}} Social Security benefits, while 157 million people were paying into the fund; of those receiving benefits, 44 million were receiving retirement benefits and 10 million disability benefits. In 2011, there will be 56 million beneficiaries and 158 million workers paying in. In 2010, total income was $781.1 billion and expenditures were $712.5 billion, which meant a total net increase in assets of $68.6 billion. Assets in 2010 were $2.6 trillion, an amount {{that is expected to}} be adequate to cover the next 10 years. In 2023, total income and interest earned on assets are projected to no longer cover expenditures for Social Security, as demographic shifts burden the system. By 2035, the ratio of potential retirees to working age persons will be 37 percent—there will be less than three potential income earners for every retiree in the population. At this rate <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund would be exhausted by 2036.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} debt {{can also be}} classified into marketable or non-marketable securities. Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The non-marketable securities are mainly the [...] "government account series" [...] owed to certain government trust funds such as <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund, which represented $2.74 trillion in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Social Security {{taxes are}} paid into <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund {{maintained}} by the U.S. Treasury (technically, the [...] "Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund", as established by [...] ). Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. government bonds. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose deficit spending. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion. Some regard the Trust Fund as an accounting construct with no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the [...] "full faith and credit" [...] of the U.S. government, which {{has an obligation to}} repay its debt.|$|E

50|$|A {{sovereign}} wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned {{investment fund}} that invests in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge funds.

2500|$|Social Security is {{a social}} {{insurance}} program officially called [...] "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" [...] (OASDI), in reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax of 12.4%. During 2016, total benefits of $910 billion were paid out, versus $882 billion in 2015, an increase of $28 billion or 3%. Social Security's total expenditures have exceeded its non-interest income since 2010. The deficit of non-interest income relative to cost was about $49 billion in 2010, $45 billion in 2011, and $55 billion in 2012. During 2010, an estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary. [...] Since the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients—nearly $2.6 trillion in 2010. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. This surplus amount is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Social Security Trust Fund". The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes. Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. Program spending is projected to rise from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will stabilize. The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP. Various reforms have been debated for Social Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax ($118,500 in 2014). Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund, the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted. Thereafter, the program under current law will pay approximately 75–78% of promised benefits {{for the remainder of the}} century.|$|E
50|$|The {{accumulated}} surpluses are {{invested in}} special non-marketable Treasury securities (treasuries) {{issued by the}} U.S. government, which are deposited in <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund. At the end of 2009, the Trust Fund stood at $2.5 trillion. The $2.5 trillion amount owed {{by the federal government}} to <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund is also a component of the U.S. National Debt, which stood at $15.7 trillion as of May 2012.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> OASDI <b>Trust</b> Fund is widely {{misunderstood}} by the public, thereby corrupting {{the debate on}} how to handle future scheduled benefits, and increasing the risk of program changes that would not be accepted if people understood how the program functions. The Trust Fund is a fiscal nullity but appears to be regarded by many as essential, hence the public debate is about how to "fix" it, rather than about the moral question of whether to fund scheduled benefits, which are clearly affordable. This misunderstanding indicates the need for a shift in emphasis in public descriptions of the program. For this, this paper lays out a set of data, arguments and analogies that are asserted to be accurate representations of the OASDI program and Trust Fund operation, and which are proposed as tools for public education. Finally, this paper argues that an important step in shifting public debate is to re-institute full recourse to Treasury funding for any payroll tax shortfall, which will force the public debate back to benefit levels and revenue sources. ...|$|R
