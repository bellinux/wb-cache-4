5|$|The curtain rises on the Court of the Exchequer, where a {{jury and}} the public {{assemble}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of breach of promise of marriage.|$|E
5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> {{that should have}} been heard by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} Baron sat <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> with {{convention}} insisting on {{a maximum of}} four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one Baron was ill or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when Baron Sotherton was ill, and in 1708, when Baron Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth Baron was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth judge {{was added to the}} Court of Common Pleas and King's Bench. The First Baron was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he {{was the head of the}} court. When he was also absent the Second Baron took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth Baron was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges' seniority. Unlike in the Court of King's Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each Baron had an equal vote in decisions.|$|E
50|$|The {{court was}} a {{superior}} court and {{a court of}} record. Judges appointed by the Governor-General constituted it as required. The court was permitted to sit anywhere in Australia as the interests of justice required, and was confined <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> on the island. When hearing criminal cases, the court sat with a jury to determine an accused person’s guilt. If the court sat outside the island, the court could use jurors from the State or Territory that the court was actually sitting at.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Cassation also {{ensures the}} correct {{application}} {{of law in}} the inferior and appeal courts and resolves disputes as to which lower court (penal, civil, administrative, military) has jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> given <b>case.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{implementation}} varies by state (also because states {{are free to}} adopt their own organizational scheme for judicial matters), trial courts are the general court of first instance <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> Convention <b>case</b> within the State court system.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, Spain's top {{criminal}} court decided <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> brought by Tibetan rights activists who alleged that China's former President Hu Jintao had committed genocide in Tibet. Spain's High Court dropped {{this case in}} June 2014.|$|E
25|$|The 1816 General Assembly retroactively removed this {{reference}} {{from his}} protest on procedural grounds. The {{reason for this}} was that the revision in the Church's Constitution (1806) had added a detailed critique of man-stealing, but this passage had never been affirmed by two-thirds of the presbyteries, as required by church law. This meant that the passage was not legally binding in a Presbyterian court. The General Assembly, whenever it specifically convenes as a court <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> is the church's supreme court.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{operates}} in two divisions, where either three or five justices sit <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before the Court. For especially important cases, the President of the Court may {{decide that the}} bench be constituted by seven justices. When a case is heard by five or seven justices, these shall usually be the most senior justices on the Court. The main rule is that cases are presented orally before the Supreme Court, and the court sessions are generally open to the public. The President of the Supreme Court presides over the session or, in his absence, the Vice-President. If neither of them is hearing the case, the most senior justice in session will preside.|$|E
50|$|In United States law, federal {{question}} jurisdiction is the {{subject-matter jurisdiction}} of United States federal courts <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> civil <b>case</b> because the plaintiff has alleged {{a violation of}} the United States Constitution, federal law, or a treaty to which the United States is a party.|$|R
50|$|Federal {{courts have}} limited {{jurisdiction}} compared to state courts. Federal courts can only rule over cases with subject matter dealing with Congress or the Constitution. Federal-question jurisdiction gives {{the federal court}} subject-matter jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> civil <b>case</b> because the appellant has claimed {{a violation of the}} Constitution.|$|R
50|$|Judicial Officers: the High Bailiff and Deputy High Bailiff, who are stipendiary magistrates, are Judicial Officers ex officio, {{together}} with any additional Judicial Officers, full-time or part-time, {{who may be}} appointed. At present there is no full-time additional Judicial Officer, but additional part-time Judicial Officers are appointed from time <b>to</b> time <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>case.</b>|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides evenly on a case. If that occurs, then {{the decision of}} the court below is affirmed, but does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it results in a return to the status quo ante. For a case to be heard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices. If a quorum is not available <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been evenly divided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court, the Chief Justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there. This has only occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of United States v. Alcoa (1945).|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 2014, seven lesbian couples each {{applied for}} a {{marriage}} license and were rejected. They subsequently {{applied for a}}n injunction. On 30 June 2014, twenty-six additional couples filed a collective amparo. In July 2014, a same-sex couple was granted the right to marry via injunction, but the judge gave no instructions for reform to the Congress, Civil Registry or the Governor of the State. Unsatisfied with {{the scope of the}} judgment, an appeal was launched on 16 July 2014. On 17 October 2014, the case was elevated to the Supreme Court and was the first hearing of an equality case from Chihuahua presented to the high court. On 22 April 2015, the SCJN agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> to determine if couples who filed injunctions were entitled to reparations from the State. In mid-August 2014, a 6th same-sex marriage was held in Chihuahua. On 20 August 2014, another same-sex marriage occurred in the state. As of August 2014, same-sex marriages have only occurred in Ciudad Juárez and in Chihuahua City. However, as of July 2014, 33 amparos had been filed in the state, 22 in the capital and 11 in Ciudad Juárez, and only nine had been approved. On 13 December 2014, a mass wedding for four lesbian couples who had obtained injunctions was held in Ciudad Juárez, which brought the total of same-sex weddings in the state to 14 for 2014. In February 2015, it was announced that 25 amparos had been successful in the state, but no legislative action had resolved the unconstitutional articles of the Civil Code.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Russian courts consented <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> {{about the}} {{declassification}} of documents about Katyn and the judicial {{rehabilitation of the}} victims. In {{an interview with a}} Polish newspaper, Vladimir Putin called Katyn a [...] "political crime".|$|E
5000|$|Venue under American law is {{a concept}} {{distinct}} from jurisdiction, which focuses on the authority of <b>a</b> court <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>case.</b> Venue {{is concerned with the}} geographical location of the court where a lawsuit is commenced. However, unlike personal jurisdiction, there is no constitutional requirement for proper venue {{in order to have a}} valid judgment.|$|R
5000|$|Some taxpayers {{asserted}} that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which became law in 1993, should necessitate legalizing conscientious objection to military taxation. The Second Circuit Court and Third Circuit Court are the highest courts <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this argument, and they disagreed. [...] The U.S. Supreme Court declined <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> such <b>a</b> <b>case</b> in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Discretionary {{jurisdiction}} is {{a circumstance}} where a court {{has the power}} to decide whether <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>case</b> brought before it. Most courts have no such power, and must entertain any case properly filed, so long as the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the questions of law which must be decided, and in personam jurisdiction over the parties to the case.|$|R
500|$|The {{reference}} in Caha to the [...] "laws {{of congress in}} respect to those matters" [...] was {{a reference to the}} matters of preservation of the peace and the protection of person and property. The Court in Caha rejected the argument that the federal courts had no jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> under the perjury statute, and the defendant's conviction was affirmed. No issues involving the power to impose and enforce federal taxes in the fifty states were presented to or decided by the court in Caha.|$|E
500|$|Recognition of {{same-sex}} marriages {{from other states}} became precedent when the Court of Appeals agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> from Prince George's County, where two women who were legally married in California had been denied a divorce by the circuit court. On May 18, 2012, the court published a unanimous ruling in Port v. Cowan that validated the marriage of Jessica Port and Virginia Cowan because it said [...] "no viable decision by the Court had deemed a valid foreign marriage to be 'repugnant'," [...] even if the marriage was void or punishable as a crime were it performed in Maryland. The opinion cited conflicts that arose from decisions in Anne Arundel and St. Mary’s counties where two same-sex couples had their petitions for divorce granted, and another case in Baltimore City where it was denied. The decision of the court {{was based on the}} state's traditional use of the common law doctrine of comity, which specifies that Maryland [...] "will give effect to laws and judicial decisions of another state or jurisdiction, not as a matter of obligation but out of deference and respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{federal court}} has a [...] "special {{obligation}} to 'satisfy itself {{not only of}} its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review. If a court {{does not have the}} power <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> it will not issue dicta. [...] Consequently, with exceptions not applicable here, a federal court must decide whether it has jurisdiction before discussing the merits of the case. Chief Justice Marshall, however, did not address jurisdictional issues until addressing the first two questions presented above. [...] Because of the canon of constitutional avoidance (i.e., where a statute can fairly be interpreted so as to avoid a constitutional issue, it should be so interpreted), courts generally deal with the constitutional issues only if necessary. [...] In this case, the jurisdictional issue was a constitutional one.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, family {{proceedings}} court (FPC) was {{the name}} given to a magistrates' court {{when members of the}} court's family panel sat <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> family <b>case.</b> It was <b>a</b> court of first instance in England and Wales that dealt with family matters. Cases were either heard in front of a bench of lay magistrates or a district judge (magistrates' courts).|$|R
50|$|Footnote: Although Holloway won {{the battle}} of {{whether there was a}} legally binding {{employment}} contract, she at the same time lost the war, as the Court of Appeal ruled that the Employment Court had no jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> such <b>a</b> <b>case</b> in the first place, leaving Holloway having to refile her claim via the District Court instead.|$|R
60|$|For me, who at {{that age}} had never so much as {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>a</b> <b>case</b> like this, of animal combustion, in the horrid mood that came over me, I almost thought the burning body was a premonition of the hell of the Calvinists, and that Miguel's earthly end was a foretaste of his eternal condemnation.|$|R
2500|$|The Court is {{authorized}} to sit either en banc or in divisions of 3, 5 or 7 members. Since the 1970s, the Court has constituted itself in 3 divisions with 5 members each. A {{majority of the}} cases are heard and decided by the divisions, rather than the court en banc. However, the Constitution requires that the Court hear en banc “ll cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international or executive agreement, as well as “those involving the constitutionality, application, or operation of presidential decrees, proclamations, orders, instructions, ordinances, and other regulations”. [...] The Court en banc also decides cases originally heard by a division when a majority vote cannot be reached within the division. The Court also has the discretion <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> en banc even if no constitutional issue is involved, as it typically does if the decision would reverse precedent or presents novel or important questions.|$|E
2500|$|Ramón Custodio, {{the head}} of the country's human rights commission, said that Zelaya's exile was a mistake and that the {{military}} made an [...] "error" [...] sending deposed President Manuel Zelaya into exile rather than holding him for trial. [...] "I didn't know they would take Zelaya out of the country," [...] Custodio {{said in an interview in}} the week of 13 August at his Tegucigalpa office. Honduras's Supreme Court has agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> brought by a group of lawyers and judges arguing that the military broke the law taking Zelaya out of the country. On 17 August 2009, President Micheletti said that a mistake was made when Zelaya was put on a plane to Costa Rica instead of being held for trial: [...] "It wasn’t correct. We have to punish whoever allowed that to happen. The rest was framed within what the constitution requires." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since Article Three of the United States Constitution {{stipulates}} that federal courts may only entertain [...] "cases" [...] or [...] "controversies", the Supreme Court cannot decide {{cases that are}} moot {{and it does not}} render advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For example, in DeFunis v. Odegaard, , the Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the Court on his claim {{would not be able to}} redress any injury he had suffered. However, the Court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that is seemingly moot. If an issue is [...] "capable of repetition yet evading review", the Court will address it even though the party before the Court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result. In Roe v. Wade, , and other abortion cases, the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct, in which the Court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.|$|E
50|$|Deemsters, i.e. the First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls, the Second Deemster and the Judge of Appeal, {{together}} with any additional Deemsters, full-time or part-time, {{who may be}} appointed. At present there is one full-time additional Deemster (who previously held the office of Deputy Deemster), and additional part-time Deemsters (previously called 'Acting Deemsters') are appointed from time <b>to</b> time <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>case.</b>|$|R

50|$|Detainees {{charged with}} {{criminal}} matters generally waited {{three to four}} years for trial {{due to a lack of}} judges <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>an</b> inadequate judicial budget, and the lengthy time required to complete police investigations.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was for him}} {{to begin}} the day's sport by making a speech, {{not so much in}} defence of his client as in {{accusation}} of the prosecutors. 'It had never,' he said, 'been his fate, he might say his misfortune, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against a man in a respectable position, opened by the Crown with such an amount of envenomed virulence.' He was then reminded that the prosecution was not carried on by the Crown. 'Then,' said he, 'we may attribute this virulence to private malice; that it is not to be attributed to any fear that this English bride should lose her fortune, or that her French husband should be deprived of any portion of his spoil, I shall be able to prove to a certainty. Did I allow myself that audacity of denunciation which my learned friend has not considered incompatible with the dignity of his new silk gown? Could I permit myself such latitude of invective as he has adopted?'--a slight laugh was here heard in the court, and an involuntary smile played across the judge's face--'yes,' continued Mr. Chaffanbrass, 'I boldly aver that I have never forgotten myself, and what is due to humanity, as my learned friend did in his address to the jury. Gentlemen of the jury, you will not confound the natural indignation which counsel must feel when defending innocence from the false attacks, with the uncalled-for, the unprofessional acerbity which has now been used in promoting such an accusation as this. I may at times be angry, when I see mean falsehood before me in vain assuming the garb of truth--for with such juries as I meet here it generally is in vain--I may at times forget myself in anger; but, if we talk of venom, virulence, and eager hostility, I yield the palm, without a contest, to my learned friend in the new silk gown.' ...|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the power of the {{executive}} to appoint JCs for limited periods or <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>case,</b> and <b>to</b> extend the tenure of Supreme Court judges beyond the age of 65 by hiring them on a term basis, may motivate such judges to render decisions that are in line with government policy. As regards the latter, a mechanism for the extension of a judge's tenure might be regarded as necessary to ensure that better judges are not replaced by less capable ones.|$|R
