The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England.

However, the control process may become unstable for large gains due to the digital and delay effects.

Both concepts <b>are</b> implemented <b>in</b> an experimental setup. It is shown that the proportional gain can be increased significantly without losing stability when the act-and-wait controller is used; thus, the force error can effectively be decreased this way. The results are confirmed by experiments. Index Terms—Discrete-time systems, feedback systems, force control, stability...|$|R

Agreeable to the positive sense of this clause, notwithstanding it is expressed individually, there is not a doubt but the army is included with all other persons in the prohibition from receiving presents or donations; a confirmation of which is, that in the clause of exceptions, wherein 'counsellors-at-law, physicians, surgeons, and chaplains are permitted to receive the fees annexed to their profession,' no mention whatever is made of any latitude given to the army, or any circumstances wherein it would be allowable for them to receive presents.... This unlucky discovery of an exclusion by act of Parliament, which admits of no abatement or evasion wherever its authority extends, renders a revisal of our proceedings necessary, and leaves no option to our decision. It is not like the ordinances of the Court of Directors, where a favorable construction may be put, and some room is left for the interposition of the authority vested in ourselves,--but positive and decisive, admitting neither of refinement nor misconstruction.
