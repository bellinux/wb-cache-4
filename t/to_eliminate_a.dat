The city is split into districts that are all initially controlled by the D.U.P., but Delsin gradually liberates each district by completing activities. When D.U.P. control of a district falls below 30 percent, Delsin can enter a District Showdown that requires him <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> wave of D.U.P. forces, eradicating D.U.P. presence there.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is {{the reaction of}} ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s. Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of them will be eliminated from further play. In order <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E

Kujan confronts Kint with the theory that Söze is one of the four other criminals with whom Verbal had worked: a corrupt former police officer and professional thief named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne).

5|$|On 7 June 1917, II ANZAC Corps—along {{with two}} British corps—launched an {{operation}} in Flanders in order <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> salient south of Ypres. The attack commenced with the detonation {{of a million}} pounds (454,545kg) of explosives that had been placed underneath the Messines ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of Messines included nearly 6,800 men. I ANZAC Corps then {{took part in the}} Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau, between September and November 1917. Individual actions took place at Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks of fighting the Australians suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E

The JNA leadership {{did not intend to}} make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive but, as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.|$|E

5|$|While the Chinese {{were making}} a {{concentrated}} attack against the South Korean front, the North Korean forces that had infiltrated the UN rear were cutting the South Korean withdrawal route. In {{the days before the}} Chinese Third Phase Campaign, the KPA II Corps established a major roadblock to the north of Hoengsong with an estimated strength of 10,000 soldiers, which blocked the retreat of the ROK III Corps. In response, the ROK II Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division conducted a siege operation against the roadblock from both the north and the south, and the roadblock was forced open by January 2. Although the UN forces managed <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> North Korean division at the roadblock, the ROK II Corps was nearly destroyed during the fighting, and it was disbanded on January 10.|$|E
5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, when Wisconsin {{initially}} numbered its highway system, {{the route}} of what later became US141 followed two separate state highways: WIS17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state {{did not have a}} highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS57 at the state line.|$|E

5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> rival.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This {{permission}} was secured by {{the intervention of the}} king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>a</b> rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E
