As a consequence, most of the kite systems need to land {{when there is no}} wind, and to take-off once the wind is strong enough. These maneuvers are quite risky because generally the wind gets weak and turbulent close to the ground’s surface. Moreover, as the wind can be strong enough at high altitude and weak close to the ground, it might lead to losses in energy production. From a material point of view, ”classic ” landings and takeoffs need a landing zone, ground handling or infrastructure (such as pylons) that reduces the advantages of kite systems. Some ideas, such as embedded motors or helium balloons, might solve this problem, but they have their own drawbacks such as the weight of the motor and its battery, the necessity of a conductive cable or the need <b>to</b> <b>refil...</b>|$|E
