40|$|This article {{suggests}} {{and discusses}} two novel aspects for {{the formulation of}} standards for environmental toxicants. First, uniform national standards for each pollutant will be underprotective for some ecosystems and overprotective for others, inasmuch as the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pollutant</b> to the indigenous biota {{is dependent on the}} physicochemical properties of the recipient environment. As the number of chemicals that need regulation is immense and as microbes appear to respond similarly to pollutant-abiotic factor interactions as do plants and animals, it is suggested that microbial assays be used initially to identify those abiotic factors that most influence the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>pollutants.</b> Thereafter, additional studies using plants and animals can focus on these pollutant-abiotic factor interactions, and more meaningful standards can then be formulated more rapidly and inexpensively. Second, it is suggested that the response to <b>pollutants</b> <b>of</b> microbe-mediated ecologic processes be used to quantitate the sensitivity of different ecosystems to various toxicants. Such a quantification, expressed in terms of an "ecological dose 50 %" (EcD 50), could be easily incorporated into the methodologies currently used to set water quality criteria and would also be applicable to setting criteria for terrestrial ecosystems...|$|R

Lacking direct observational data {{on the extent of}} green consumerism, we construct an indirect method to elicit its effect on pollution abatement. Assuming that environmentally-motivated consumers cannot attribute pollution to individual goods produced by a multi-product firm, but rather reduce their demand across all product lines of the firm, we identify green consumerism through intra-firm inter-plant spillover effects in pollution abatement. We anticipate that such “environmentally-leveraged ” companies will reduce emissions by more than non-leveraged companies when they are exposed to consumer markets.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Membrane drug {{transporters}} {{are well}} recognized as important contributing factors to pharmacokinetics, notably involved in drug-drug interactions. Besides drugs, environmental chemicals, to which humans are commonly exposed, are also substrates, inhibitors or inducers of drug transporters, {{which may have}} notable consequences toward toxicokinetics, toxicity and pharmacokinetics.

Implications for toxicokinetics and <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> and pharmacokinetics of drugs administrated to pollutant-exposed humans are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although various structurally unrelated environmental chemicals have been already demonstrated to interact with drug transporters, further in vitro and in vivo studies are probably required to characterize pollutant-transporter interplays in a more extensive and accurate way.

Effects of phenanthrene were assessed on mesofauna population dynamics, fungal biomass (ergosterol concentrations), and litter decomposition (litter mass loss, nitrogen concentration). The effects of each community {{on the fate of}} phenanthrene were also assessed. We hypothesize that phenanthrene affects the population dynamics of mesofauna and soil biological functioning depending on exposure duration, type of community, or both. Results show that phenanthrene exerted an effect on mesofauna and that the effects on some species, like Folsomia fimetaria, were influenced by the species composition in the mesocosms, the soil layer, and the sampling date. However, the effects of phenanthrene on ergosterol content and organic matter decomposition were not significantly influenced by community composition. These results demonstrate that interspecific relationships are needed to assess the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> and should be taken into account in ecotoxicological risk assessment. Furthermore, this work does not support the hypothesis of a direct link between toxic effects of organic pollutants on mesofauna species and soil biological functioning...|$|E
