5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} never meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> biographical film to Ip Man's life, but to broadly touch on the {{elements}} from his life. Most of the central turns of the plot are there only {{for the purpose of}} making a movie more exciting, including the scenes depicting duels between Ip Man and the Japanese, including Consul General Miura Yoshiaki (三浦義秋), as well as Ip Man encountering hardship during the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E

5|$|In his {{commentary}} on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote {{of the importance of}} choosing to follow what one knew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his {{commentary on}} the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{has often}} classified Archaeopteryx {{as the most}} primitive bird. It is not thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, Archaeopteryx was often used {{as a model of}} the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird. They suggested that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that Avimimus was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than Archaeopteryx. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.|$|E

50|$|Alongside Lyrical Abstract {{painters}} in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique {{over the}} comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so {{popular in the}} U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonfigurative Group of Seven, they <b>were</b> looking <b>to</b> create <b>a</b> distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>truer</b> means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying paint with palette knives and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.|$|R

5|$|Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, {{the long}} history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, {{particularly}} Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> mixed language.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, the Bolsheviks did not {{consider}} the status class of the intelligentsiya <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> social class, as defined in Marxist philosophy. In that time, the Bolsheviks used the Russian word prosloyka (stratum) to negatively identify and define the intelligentsia as a separating layer without a social function, because the intellectuals and the managers are an unproductive mid-layer (status class), between the workers (working class) and the exploiters (bourgeoisie).|$|E

Unlike exclaves, they are not entirely surrounded by foreign territory. Hence, they are exclaves for practical purposes, without meeting the strict definition.|$|E

25|$|Restriction of Trusts and schemes: Swamiji was {{a person}} who wanted to help people of every {{community}} and not just the Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin Community.

Unfortunately for Golosov, extremely hard geological conditions required heavy, wide support pylons.

This station opened to public in 1935, while Fomin was alive. He designed one more station, Teatralnaya (then Ploschad Sverdlova), which was completed two years after his death.|$|E
25|$|Since Donnelly's day, {{there have}} been dozens of {{locations}} proposed for Atlantis, {{to the point where}} the name has become a generic concept, divorced from the specifics of Plato's account. This is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the Atlantic at all. Few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses, while others have been made by psychic (e.g., Edgar Cayce) or other pseudoscientific means. (The Atlantis researchers Jacques Collina-Girard and Georgeos Díaz-Montexano, for instance, each claim the other's hypothesis is pseudoscience.) Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none has been demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> historical Atlantis.|$|E
