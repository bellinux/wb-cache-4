5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, authentic, and {{understated}} acting style and screen performances. His career spanned <b>thirty-five</b> <b>years,</b> from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star {{from the end of}} the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{force has}} been {{variously}} estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard's army. Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed {{the core of}} Henry's army. John Mair, writing <b>thirty-five</b> <b>years</b> after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component, and this claim is accepted by some modern writers, but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their elite Scottish knights and archers, and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny.|$|E

5|$|In August 1701, George was {{invested}} with the Order of the Garter and, within six weeks, the nearest Catholic claimant to the thrones, the former king James II, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive {{to the new}} Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by <b>thirty-five</b> <b>years,</b> but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or her son. However, it was George who understood the complexities of English politics and constitutional law, which required further acts in 1705 to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the Principality of Lüneburg-Grubenhagen, centred at Celle.|$|E
5|$|Jane Austen was {{primarily}} educated {{at home by}} her father and older brothers and through her own reading. Her apprenticeship as a writer lasted from her teenage years until she was about <b>thirty-five</b> <b>years</b> old. During this period, she wrote three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1815, {{with the release of}} Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey (originally written in 1798–1799 and revised later) and Persuasion, both published after her death in 1817, and began a third (eventually titled Sanditon), but died before it could be completed. A product of 18th-century literary traditions, Austen's works were influenced most by those of renowned writer and critic Samuel Johnson and novelists Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth. She considered poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott a rival. Family theatricals, which included plays by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and other 18th-century dramatists, shaped Austen's writing from an early age. William Cowper's poetry was a favourite as were the novels of Samuel Richardson. Austen's engagement with sensibility illustrates her debt to sentimental writers such as Laurence Sterne.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} reserve until April 1918, when German forces attacked {{as part of}} the Spring Offensive. During the Battle of the Lys, the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was effectively wiped out, leaving a two-mile wide gap in the British lines. The 33rd was ordered into position, and Pinney personally commanded the divisional machine-gun battalion, which—with the assistance of various stragglers from retreating units—helped turn back a heavy German attack at the Battle of Hazebrouck on 12 and 13 April. For his service in April, Pinney, along with the commanders of the 12th, 55th and 61st Divisions, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The 33rd was used to train the American 30th Infantry Division through the summer, but went over to the offensive in September, seeing action at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal, the Battle of Cambrai, and the Battle of the Selle. At the Selle, Pinney organised a dawn attack with improvised bridges, allowing the 33rd to force a bridgehead and successfully clear the opposing bank in a short time. The division finished the war in the Sambre valley, and began demobilisation. In February 1919, with the division mostly demobilised, Pinney retired from the army, aged fifty-six, after <b>thirty-five</b> <b>years</b> service.|$|E
