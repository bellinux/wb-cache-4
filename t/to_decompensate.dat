Clinical decompensation represents a milestone event for the patient with cirrhosis, yet there remains uncertainty regarding precisely how to define this important phenomenon. With the development of broader treatment options for cirrhotic hepatitis patients, efficient identification of liver status before evolving <b>to</b> <b>decompensated</b> cirrhosis could be life-saving, but research on the topic has been limited by inconsistencies across studies, populations, and case-confirmation methods. We sought to determine whether diagnosis/procedure codes drawn from electronic health records (EHRs) {{could be used to}} identify patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In our first step, chart review was used to determine liver status (compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, noncirrhotic) in patients from the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study. Next, a hybrid approach between Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression and Classification Regression Trees models was used to optimize EHR-based identification of decompensated cirrhosis, based on 41 diagnosis and procedure codes. These models were validated using tenfold cross-validation; method accuracy was evaluated by positive predictive values (PPVs) and area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Among 296 patients (23 with hepatitis B, 268 with hepatitis C, and 5 co-infected) with a 2 : 1 ratio of biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis to noncirrhosis, chart review identified 127 cases of decompensated cirrhosis (Kappa= 0. 88). The algorithm of five liver-related conditions—liver transplant, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal varices complications/procedures, ascites, and ­cirrhosis—yielded a PPV of 85 % and an AUROC of 92 %. A hierarchical subset of three conditions (hepatocellular carcinoma, ascites, and esophageal varices) demonstrated a PPV of 81 % and an AUROC of 86 %. Given the excellent predictive ability of our model, this EHR-based automated algorithm may be used to successfully identify patients with decompensated cirrhosis. This algorithm may contribute to timely identification and treatment of viral hepatitis patients who have progressed <b>to</b> <b>decompensated</b> cirrhosis.

40|$|Various data on type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 1 DM) have showed {{that the incidence of}} T 1 DM peaks at puberty. However, diabetes control and complications could be adversely affected by the physiological changes of puberty. In early years of insulin therapy, severe growth retardation with pubertal delay, like in Mauriac syndrome, have been reported. Insulin and leptin are metabolic factors, circulating in the periphery, which participate in the hypothalamic control of metabolism and reproduction. Insulin may be an important regulator of leptin in humans. Increased levels of advanced glycation end products suppress activation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator, resulting in pubertal delay. Glycemic control deteriorates during puberty as the lean body mass doubles mainly over a period of 25 years, which increases insulin requirement. There is also an increase in insulin resistance over the period of puberty. In normal individuals, fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations reach a peak in both sexes in mid to late puberty. Puberty, at all stages, has the worst insulin resistance. It has been observed that an excessive GH secretion in T 1 DM during puberty has significant effects on ketogenesis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Proper {{assessment}} of dyspnea {{is important in}} patients with heart failure. Our aim was {{to evaluate the use}} of the 5 -point Likert scale for dyspnea to assess the degree of pulmonary congestion and to determine the prognostic value of this scale for predicting adverse events in heart failure outpatients. METHODS: We undertook a prospective study of outpatients with moderate to severe heart failure. The 5 -point Likert scale was applied during regular outpatient visits, along with clinical assessments. Lung ultrasound with &# 8805; 15 B-lines and an amino-terminal portion of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level > 1000 pg/mL were used as a reference for pulmonary congestion. The patients were then assessed every 30 days during follow-up to identify adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We included 58 patients (65. 5 % male, age 43. 5 &# 177; 11 years) with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 27 &# 177; 6 %. In total, 29. 3 % of these patients had heart failure with ischemic etiology. Additionally, pulmonary congestion, as diagnosed by lung ultrasound, was present in 58 % of patients. A higher degree of dyspnea (3 or 4 points on the 5 -point Likert scale) was significantly correlated with a higher number of B-lines (p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 016). Patients stratified into Likert&# 8202;=&# 8202; 3 - 4 were at increased risk of admission compared with those in class 1 - 2 after adjusting for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class and levels of NT-proBNP > 1000 pg/mL (HR&# 8202;=&# 8202; 4. 9, 95 % CI 1. 33 - 18. 64, p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 017).

This study aimed to compare treatment outcomes and mortality rate in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery and medical therapy who presented with severe ventricular dysfunction and triple-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with severe ventricular dysfunction and triple-vessel CAD during 2010 - 2011 in the Imam Ali Hospital of Kermanshah University of Medical Science. Patients were divided into two groups of medical therapy (group one) and OPCAB (group two). Follow-up data were collected after 30 months. Survival estimation was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression model. Results: Of the 276 enrolled patients, 139 (50. 4 %) underwent group one and 137 (49. 6 %) group two. Study groups were homogenous in baseline characteristics, with the exception of hyperlipidemia (P= 0. 005). A significant difference was observed in cardiac mortality rates between the study groups (hazard ratio: 0. 260; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 105 - 0. 644; P= 0. 004). However, no significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the frequency of admission due <b>to</b> <b>decompensate</b> heart failure (P= 0. 17). In addition, the rate of admission due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the first group was higher than the second group, significantly (P= 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction - This chapter {{discusses}} {{the aspects of}} orthognatic surgery related to cleft Lip & palate (CLP) patients. Usually these patients have several prior surgeries to their lips and palate, and this result in a lack {{of growth in the}} maxilla. As a result, several patients will have hypoplastic maxillas, and will need to have an orthognatic surgery procedure such as a maxillary advancement. This surgery is usually done after the end of facial growth, and a full multidisciplinary team is needed. Several treatment phases will need to be fulfilled, and particularly the role of orthodontics and phonoaudiology will be observed. Pre-surgical orthodontics - patients with CLP will need to be re-evaluated frequently during their entire life, and orthodontics are usually the professionals that will be most active in this regard. When it comes to an orthognatic surgery decision, they will do a pre-operative orthodontic mechanics <b>to</b> <b>decompensate,</b> align and coordinate the upper and lower teeth. Orthognatic Surgery - the several surgical possibilities are discussed here, and some clinical examples are also shown. Usually the Le Fort I osteotomy is indicated for advancement of the maxilla, but other options include mandibular sagital split osteotomies or variations of the Le Fort I, particularly in bilateral cases. Post-surgical Orthodontics - after he surgery patients usually will need to have a follow up of 6 months when the final dental movements will be done. In some selected cases when the pre-maxilla is still mobile patients ill need to wear orthodontic appliances for very long periods. Phonoaudiology approach - although the interventions done by these professionals are similar to those used in standard orthognatic surgeries, there are some changes that are discussed here. The therapist should be involved since the pre-surgical orthodontic phase, observing speech and masticatory difficulties. Velopharyngeal incompetence is common and needs to be carefully evaluated since the surgery usually will move the maxilla forwards, and possibly worsens this. Treatment in the pre-operative phase can include elongating muscles, massaging the lip scar tissue and others. After the surgery the phonoaudiology therapist will look after oedema control, proper mouth opening and TMJ function, as well as traditional speech therapy. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{years of}} dedicated {{research into the}} origin of idiopathic scoliosis, the pathogenesis of this classic orthopaedic disorder has so far remained elusive. A striking feature of idiopathic scoliosis {{is the fact that}} it does not occur in vertebrates other than humans, despite many similarities in the basic architecture of the vertebral column across the species. From recent work by Castelein et al, it was demonstrated that the fully erect posture, which is unique to humans, significantly alters spinal loading conditions. It was shown that the backward inclined or 'declive' segments of the human spine are subject to dorsal shear loads. These dorsal shear loads are an important distinction between the human spine and the spine of all other vertebrates. In this thesis, it was postulated that excessive dorsal shear loads during the period of rapid growth, could lead to rotational instability of the declive segments of the spine. If progressive, these dorsal shear loads not only reduce rotational stability, but also can enhance a slight preexistent vertebral rotation. 1. In a biomechanical in vitro study on porcine and human spinal segments, we showed that at the mid and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal shear loads than under ventral shear loads. These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal shear loads than under ventral shear loads. We believe that these dorsally directed shear loads can, under critical circumstances during growth, introduce vertebral rotation, whereas ventrally directed loads counteract rotation. 2. The normal, nonscoliotic human spine shows a preexistent pattern of rotation in the transverse plane. The thoracic vertebrae are predominantly rotated to the right side, similar to what is seen in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. We believe that if the spine starts <b>to</b> <b>decompensate</b> into scoliosis, it seems logical that this built-in rotational pattern will be followed. 3. In neuromuscular scoliosis, it was demonstrated that despite the difference in origin, curve patterns in neuromuscular disease show many similarities with those in idiopathic scoliosis, such as a strong prevalence of right convex thoracic curves. We concluded that preexistent rotation, rather than muscle imbalance, also plays an important role in directing subsequent rotation in neuromuscular disease, as it does in idiopathic scoliosis. 4. We also showed the existence of a predominant rotation of the thoracic vertebrae to the right side in the quadruped spine, similar to what was found in humans. It was concluded that preexistent rotation can be considered as a physiological process in the normal development of the spine, independent of the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis. 5. Finally, we demonstrated that the normal, nonscoliotic spine of humans with a complete mirror image reversal of the internal body organs (situs inversus totalis) shows a preexistent pattern of vertebral rotation opposite to what is seen in humans with normal organ anatomy.

In the case of pressure-overload conditions occurring in aortic stenosis or hypertension, cardiac remodeling evolves progres-sively from an initial compensatory ventricular hypertrophy <b>to</b> <b>decompensated</b> hypertrophy characterized by cardiac dila-tion and contractile dysfunction. 1 Loss of cardiac function is generally associated with fetal gene reprogramming, aberrant calcium handling, loss of cardiomyocytes, and excessive fibro-sis. 2, 3 To date, the mechanisms responsible for the progression of cardiac remodeling and for triggering the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to failure remain unknown. Clinical Perspective on p 2124 Many observations provided strong evidence involving inflammation in the progression of chronic HF. In particu...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{factors that}} precipitates heart failure {{in children with}} rheumatic heart disease. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting: Paediatric wards at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. Subjects: Children with Rheumatic heart disease admitted for in-patient care due <b>to</b> <b>decompensated</b> heart failure. Results: A total of 33 patients were studied, thirty two of whom were in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV and one in class III. Non-compliance to anti-failure therapy {{was the most common}} precipitating factor occurring in 87. 9 % cases. Arrhythmia, recurrent rheumatic fever, pneumonia, infective endocarditis, anaemia and overexertion were identified as other precipitating factors. Seventy percent of the patients did not adhere to secondary prophylaxis against rheumatic fever. Conclusion: Non compliance to anti-failure therapy was the most common precipitating factor...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow chimerism (BMC) {{develops}} after allogeneic he-matopoietic {{stem cell}} transplantion (HSCT); however, BMC is {{also associated with}} graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following liver transplantation, which has an incidence rate of 0. 1 - 2 % and a mortality rate exceeding 75 % [1]. Therefore, detecting BMC is also important in solid organ transplantation (SOT) as well as HSCT, and accurate quantification is needed, especially in case of clonality distinction of minimal portions. This study aimed to introduce the significance of BMC in SOT, by using conventional short tandem repeat (STR) -PCR [2 - 4] and next generation se-quencing (NGS), through relative quantification of single-nucle-otide polymorphisms (SNP). A 55 -yr-old Korean woman underwent liver transplantation owing <b>to</b> <b>decompensated</b> hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. The donor was a 40 -yr-old woman who died from subarachnoi...|$|R
