5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Smyth {{began to}} shift his {{interest}} to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick's {{discovery of the}} neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton splitting the atom, and Ernest Lawrence's invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last research articles concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium-3. His appointment as department chair forced him <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to administrative work, {{at the expense of}} research. As department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, when Bill Davis became Premier, he was {{appointed}} to cabinet as a Minister without portfolio. Dunlop announced his retirement from politics in May 1970, well before his appointment to cabinet. He said that two terms was [...] "a sufficient part of a man's career." [...] He wanted <b>to</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>more</b> time <b>to</b> his job as director of CARS and {{spend more time with}} his family.|$|R

5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain extraneous plot points relating to Attack of the Clones. Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and {{the origins of the}} Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to cricket. Constantine realised that to succeed {{as a professional}} cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974 {{by mutual}} {{agreement}} {{he was released from}} the function of Exarch, in order <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> himself <b>more</b> fully <b>to</b> the pastoral needs of the growing flock of his diocese. [...] Between 1966 and 1986 he brought out six books on prayer.|$|R
50|$|Hoffmeister’s {{publishing}} activities reached a peak in 1791, but thereafter he appeared <b>to</b> have <b>devoted</b> <b>more</b> time <b>to</b> composition. Most of his operas were composed and staged {{during the early}} 1790s and this, combined with an apparent lack of business sense, led to his noticeable decline as a publisher.|$|R
5|$|Early in the 1958–59 season, Punch Imlach, the {{assistant}} {{general manager of the}} Leafs, fired Reay, installed himself as head coach, and appointed Olmstead as the playing assistant coach. This meant that while Imlach coached the team during games, Olmstead {{was in charge of the}} practices; however, Olmstead only lasted three months as assistant coach, resigning <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to improving his play. The same season, the Leafs went on a long winning streak in order to qualify for the playoffs, but they lost to the Canadiens in the finals. After losing in the Finals the next season, and falling short of the Finals the next season, Olmstead won his fifth and final Stanley Cup in 1962, missing two months of the season with a broken shoulder, and being limited to only four out of the 12playoffgames.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{was named}} a vice {{president}} of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season. From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens. Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year. He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games. His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to managing his restaurant and other business interests. He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader even in his youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> time to botany.|$|E

50|$|In 1919, Gruenberg wrote The Hill of Dreams for orchestra, which gained him {{the highly}} {{acclaimed}} Flagler Prize and enabled him <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> himself <b>more</b> completely <b>to</b> composition.

50|$|To {{surrender}} oneself is <b>more</b> than <b>to</b> <b>devote</b> oneself, <b>more</b> than <b>to</b> give oneself, it is {{even something}} more than to abandon oneself to God. In a word, to surrender oneself is to die to everything and to self, to be no longer concerned with self except to keep it continually turned toward God.|$|R

60|$|And as to {{the second}} objection--costliness--the reply is, first, that the rate and the Parliamentary grant {{together}} ought to be enough, considering that science and art teaching is already provided for; and, secondly, {{that if they are}} not, it may be well for the educational parliament to consider what has become of those endowments which were originally intended <b>to</b> be <b>devoted,</b> <b>more</b> or less largely, to the education of the poor.|$|R
