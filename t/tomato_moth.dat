40|$|We {{examined}} {{the resistance of}} improved tomato strains rich in 2 -tridecanone (2 -TD), zingiberene (ZGB) and acyl sugars (AA) to the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth,</b> Tuta absoluta. We also studied whether selection for strains with higher densities of glandular trichomes, and thus presumably strains with higher concentrations of 2 -tridecanone, was effective in promoting greater resistance to the moth. The TOM- 584 and TOM- 679 strains were used as susceptible controls, which have normal concentrations of the three allelochemicals. The improved strain TOM- 687, which has a high AA content, has a widely documented resistance and {{was used as a}} standard resistant strain. The wild strain PI 134417, which is resistant by means of its high 2 -TD content, was also used as a standard resistant strain. The experiment was installed in a greenhouse with a completely randomized design. The wild strain PI 134417 was confirmed as being highly resistant. TOM- 622 (rich in 2 -TD), ZGB- 703 (rich in ZGB), and TOM- 687 (rich in AA) showed significant reductions in the oviposition rate of the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth,</b> damage to the plants, injury to the leaflets, and the percentage of leaflets attacked in comparison with the control strains (TOM- 584 and TOM- 679). The levels of resistance to the moth for the TOM- 622, ZGB- 703, and TOM- 687 strains were similar. In general, the genotypes with higher densities of glandular trichomes had greater resistance than the susceptible controls, with the strain BPX- 367 D- 238 - 02 being particularly notable in its resistance...|$|E
40|$|The <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> (Tuta absoluta Meyrick, Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) has {{traditionally}} been managed in Chile with organophosphate, pyrethroid, and nereistoxin insecticides; all of these have wide action spectra and high toxicity {{and many of them}} have developed rapid resistance. It is therefore important to have new molecules which are effective in controlling this pest; how ever, these molecules must have lower toxicity and greater selectivity for beneficial fauna to produce a more sustainable tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production. The objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} T. absoluta control with cyantraniliprole insecticide, which has desirable characteristics for programs of integrated pest management of tomato; we thus performed three trials in the 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 seasons in the Coquimbo Region, Chile. These trials evaluated the control of T. absoluta using different doses of two formulations: cyantraniliprole 10 OD (oil dispersion) with or without surfactants (Dyne-Amic, Codacide) applied to leaves and cyantraniliprole 20 SC (suspension concentrate) applied to soil. Trials used a randomized complete block design with four replicates. The effect of treatments was compared with standard insecticides and a control without insecticide. The degree of control was estimated by foliar and fruit damage at harvest. Results indicate a reduction in fruit damage between 75 % and 85 % for foliar applications and 82 % for soil applications of cyantraniliprole. It is concluded that both formulations of cyantraniliprole were effective to reduce damage caused by the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> larva in both the foliage and fruit of tomato...|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of plant lectins to insects after oral ingestion was investigated by incorporating the proteins into insect diets. Bioassays carried out using an artificial diet system demonstrated that kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) lectin (PHA) caused {{a significant decrease}} in survival of larvae of the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth,</b> Lacanobia oleracea. Jackfruit (Artocarpus integrifolia) lectin (jacalin) and black mulberry (Morus nigra) lectin both caused {{a significant decrease in}} growth of the peach potato aphid (Myzus persicae) when compared to controls in an artificial diet based bioassay. Interactions of lectins with insect gut tissues in vivo were studied by immunolocalisation. Binding of the snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin;GNA) and jack bean (Canavalia ensifomiis) lectin (Concanavalin A; Con-A) to the digestive tract of L oleracea larvae was observed and localised at the electron microscope level after oral ingestion of the proteins. GNA was also observed to bind to the midgut of the two-spot ladybird Adalia bipunctata. No disruption of the brush border membrane of either L oleracea or A. bipunctata was observed. Binding of GNA to the peritrophic membrane of L. oleracea was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Histological evidence of lectin binding to insect guts in vivo was corroborated by in vitro studies, which showed that the lectins GNA and Con- A bind to sections of the digestive tract of L. oleracea larvae. Binding of Con-A to proteins from brush border membranes, solubilised brush border membranes and peritrophic membranes was also observed. The use of confocal microscopy showed that GNA bound to the midgut and haemocytes of the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae, both when incubated with isolated tissues and cells and when fed orally to live insects, providing evidence for transport of GNA across the gut wall. Larvae of L. oleracea fed the lectins GNA and PHA showed a significant increase in polyphenoloxidase levels within the haemolymph, suggesting that the lectins were causing systemic responses in the insects. A partial sequence for leucine aminopeptidase a potential receptor for lectin binding was obtained from a cDNA library constructed from the midgut of the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> larvae...|$|E

Parasitism rate and the proportion of eggs with emerging hole were calculated as number of parasitized eggs and number of eggs with emerging holes, respectively, by the number of viable eggs. The viability of parasitoid development until adult stage was calculated as number of eggs with emerging hole/number of parasitized eggs.

40|$|Biological and {{ecological}} attributes of Tuta absoluta, as well as, {{some aspects of}} parasitoid-host interaction of T. absoluta egg and larval parasitoids in the laboratory and in the field. Currently, results indicate that immature T. absoluta stages are attacked by a parasitoid community spontaneously present in tomato crops in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and in Italy. Especially for the larval stage, the parasitoid wasps Pseudapanteles dignus and Dineulophus phtorimaeae are proven to coexist in the field, and show characteristics that suggest {{that they could be}} considered as biocontrol agents against the pest by means of augmentative releases. Field evaluation of effective biological control achieved by P. dignus and/or D. pthorimaeae will assess their compatibility with IPM on tomato, and our assessment of economic feasibility of parasitoid mass rearing.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{population}} reduction of the <b>tomato</b> leafminer <b>moth,</b> Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), by Pyemotes sp. in the laboratory. The mite became greenish when fed on caterpillars, pupae, and adults of T. absoluta. The caterpillars and adults of T. absoluta were quickly paralyzed by the mite venom. A single T. absoluta could host many Pyemotes sp, physogastric females, which were allowed to grow on the moth. Pyemotes sp. can be a new alternative for the biological control of T. absoluta. However, this possibility must be better understood {{before it could be}} recommended, because Pyemotes sp. could also cause dermatitis in the humans...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tomato</b> leafminer <b>moth</b> is a pest of {{tomatoes}} and other vegetable crops, including eggplants, peppers, and potatoes. It {{is considered an}} economically damaging pest in many areas where it is present, including South America. Tomato leafminer larvae can feed and develop on tomato fruit, leaves, or stems. As the larvae feed, they create tunnels— called “mines”—under the plant tissue surface (see fig. 2). This feeding injures the affected tissue and weakens the plant’s ability to sustain itself through photosynthesis. The larvae reduce crop yield and fruit quality in two ways: directly, through their feeding; and indirectly, by providing a pathway for disease-causing micro-organisms to enter the plant. Even {{a small amount of}} damage can make fruit unmarketable as fresh produce. This pest is distribute...|$|R
40|$|Insect {{oviposition}} {{on plants}} frequently precedes herbivory. Accumulating {{evidence indicates that}} plants recognize insect oviposition and elicit direct or indirect defenses to reduce the pressure of future herbivory. Most of the oviposition-triggered plant defenses described thus far remove eggs or keep {{them away from the}} host plant or their desirable feeding sites. Here, we report induction of antiherbivore defense by insect oviposition which targets newly hatched larvae, not the eggs, in the system of tomato Solanum lycopersicum L., and <b>tomato</b> fruitworm <b>moth</b> Helicoverpa zea Boddie. When tomato plants were oviposited by H. zea moths, pin 2, a highly inducible gene encoding protease inhibitor 2, which is a representative defense protein against herbivorous arthropods, was expressed at significantly higher level at the oviposition site than surrounding tissues, and expression decreased with distance away from the site of oviposition. Moreover, more eggs resulted in higher pin 2 expression in leaves, and both fertilized and unfertilized eggs induced pin 2 expression. Notably, when quantified daily following deposition of eggs, pin 2 expression at the oviposition site was highest just before the emergence of larvae. Furthermore, H. zea oviposition primed the wound-induced increase of pin 2 transcription and a burst of jasmonic acid (JA); tomato plants previously exposed to H. zea oviposition showed significantly stronger induction of pin 2 and higher production of JA upon subsequent simulated herbivory than without oviposition. Our results suggest that tomato plants recognize H. zea oviposition as a signal of impending future herbivory and induce defenses to prepare for this herbivory by newly hatched neonate larvae...|$|R
40|$|Insecticides have {{traditionally}} been used to prevent damage to crops by herbivorous insects. There is concern {{over the use of}} traditional chemical insecticides and this has {{led to the development of}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programmes and a search for alternative methods of control and novel insecticidal molecules. Effective implementation of EPM requires compatibility between control methods, particularly with regard to beneficial species such as parasitoids. The impact of novel control methods and insecticidal compounds on beneficial insects therefore needs to be assessed to ensure that there are no detrimental effects on the biology and behaviour of these species. When larvae of the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth,</b> Lacanobia oleracea, were fed on leaves from tomato plants expressing the snowdrop lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) at a level of approximately 2 % of total soluble protein, significant increases in the mean larval weight, and in the amount of food consumed were found. This resulted in an overall reduction in the mean development time to the pupal stage of approximately 7 days. The percentage survival to the adult moth was significantly increased for larvae reared on the transgenic tomato leaves compared to larvae reared on leaves from control plants. These results are in contrast to similar studies with GNA-expressing potato plants. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Wild {{habitats}} adjoining farmland {{are potentially}} valuable sources of natural enemies, {{but also of}} pests. Here we tested the utility of birds as ‘sampling devices’, to identify the diversity of prey available to predators and particularly to screen for pests and natural enemies using natural ecosystems as refugia. Here we used PCR to amplify prey DNA from three sympatric songbirds foraging on small invertebrates in Phragmites reedbed ecosystems, namely the Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), Sedge Warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) and Cetti's Warbler (Cettia cetti). A recently described general invertebrate primer pair {{was used for the}} first time to analyse diets. Amplicons were cloned and sequenced, then identified by reference to the Barcoding of Life Database and to our own sequences obtained from fresh invertebrates. Forty-five distinct prey DNA sequences were obtained from 11 faecal samples, of which 39 could be identified to species or genus. Targeting three warbler species ensured that species-specific differences in prey choice broadened the range of prey taken. Amongst the prey found in reedbeds were major pests (including the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> Lacanobia oleracea) as well as many potentially valuable natural enemies including aphidophagous hoverflies and braconid wasps. Given the mobility of birds, this approach provides a practical way of sampling a whole habitat at once, providing growers with information on possible invasion by locally resident pests and the colonization potential of natural enemies from local natural habitats...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In several {{regions of}} Brazil, Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Guenée) {{is one of}} the most serious <b>tomato</b> pests. The <b>moth</b> lays eggs on the calyx or {{developing}} fruit, and shortly after eclosion larvae penetrate into the fruit, where they remain until pupation. Once larvae have entered the fruits, insecticides and biological control agents are relatively ineffective. Because N. elegantalis is most susceptible to conventional treatments when the larvae are outside the host tissues (or fruit), it would be advantageous to know the time required for egg development and the length of time that the larvae spend on the surface of the fruit. To answer these questions detailed behavioral studies were untaken. Eggs were collected from the field and maintained in an environmental chamber at 20 °C, 75 ± 5 % R. H., and a 12 L: 12 D photoperiod. The time of egg eclosion was recorded with a video camera, whereas larval behavior and time required to enter the fruit were determined by direct observations. The majority of eggs (93 %) hatched within the first two hours after the beginning of photophase. Larvae spent 51. 1 ± 31. 1 (mean ± SEM) min on the surface of the fruits. Once a suitable site was identified, larvae required an additional 23. 8 ± 19. 4 min to completely enter the fruit. Eighty-six percent of the larvae were successful in penetrating the fruit. Of the larvae that bored into the fruit, 42 % selected the upper portion, 18 % selected the middle portion, and 40 % selected the lower portion...|$|R

Aims: To {{introduce}} a cry gene into microorganisms that naturally colonize the phylloplane of tomato plants {{to improve the}} persistence of the Cry proteins for controlling a South American <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> (Tuta absoluta, Meyrick, 1917). Methods and Results: A cry 1 Ab gene isolated from a native Bacillus thuringiensis strain (LM- 466), showing a relevant activity against T. absoluta larvae, was cloned into the shuttle vector pHT 315 (Arantes and Lereclus 1991). The construct was introduced by electroporation into native Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis strains, both natural inhabitants of the tomato phylloplane. Western analysis and toxicity assays against the target larvae proved that the successful expression of the gene was accomplished in host bacteria. Recombinant toxin displayed a similar LC 50 value in comparison to native donor strain LM- 466. Both transformed Bacillus survived for at least 45 days on the tomato leaf surface. Conclusions: Plant-associated microorganisms that naturally colonize the phylloplane could be useful as recombinant microbial delivery systems of toxin genes of B. thuringiensis. Significance and Impact of the Study: Modified microorganisms capable of surviving on leaf surfaces for several weeks with insecticidal activity should allow for a reduction in pesticide application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{evidence}} suggesting {{a role in}} plant defence, the use of plant lectins in crop protection has been hindered by their low and species-specific insecticidal activity. Snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) is transported to the haemolymph of insects after oral ingestion, {{and can be used}} as a basis for novel insecticides. Recombinant proteins containing GNA expressed as a fusion with a peptide or protein, normally only toxic when injected into the insect haemolymph, have the potential to show oral toxicity as a result of GNA-mediated uptake. Results A gene encoding a toxin, ButaIT, from the red scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) was synthesised and assembled into expression constructs. One construct contained ButaIT alone, whereas the other contained ButaIT fused N-terminally to a GNA polypeptide (ButaIT/GNA). Both recombinant proteins were produced using the yeast Pichia pastoris as an expression host, and purified. Recombinant ButaIT and ButaIT/GNA were acutely toxic when injected into larvae of <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> (Lacanobia oleracea), causing slow paralysis, leading to mortality or decreased growth. ButaIT/GNA was chronically toxic when fed to L. oleracea larvae, causing decreased survival and weight gain under conditions where GNA alone was effectively non-toxic. Intact ButaIT/GNA was detected in larval haemolymph from insects fed the fusion protein orally, demonstrating transport of the linked polypeptide across the gut. Proteolysis of the fusion protein was also observed. ButaIT/GNA was significantly more toxic that GNA alone when fed to the homopteran Nilaparvata lugens (rice brown planthopper) in liquid artificial diet. Conclusion The ButaIT/GNA recombinant fusion protein is toxic to lepidopteran larvae both when injected and when fed orally, showing the utility of GNA as a carrier to transport potentially toxic peptides and proteins across the insect gut. Although ButaIT has been claimed to be lepidopteran-specific, the fusion protein has more wide-ranging insecticidal activity. Fusion proteins based on plant lectins have potential applications in crop protection, both as exogenously applied treatments and as endogenous products in transgenic plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fusion {{proteins}} {{containing a}} toxin fused to a carrier domain which directs transport across the insect gut epithelium {{have been shown}} to be effective orally active insecticides. Expression of functional recombinant fusion proteins comprising of snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) fused to toxins from Indian red scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus toxin; ButaIT) and Blue Mountains funnel-web spider (Hadronyche versuta toxins; ω-ACTX-Hv 1 a (ω-ACTX); κ-ACTX-Hv 1 c (κ-ACTX)) was carried out in both yeast (Pichia pastoris) and plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) expression systems. Addition of purification tags, altering the design of assembly of the fusion protein and point mutation of toxin sequence were all investigated to improve yield and reduce proteolytic cleavage during expression and purification. Recombinant proteins were assayed for oral toxicity against T. castaneum as a model coleopteran species. Fusion proteins incorporating ButaIT and ω-ACTX toxins showed toxicity ranging from complete mortality when fed at 1 mg g- 1 ((his) 6 -GNA-ω-ACTX and ω-ACTX-GNA-(his) 6) to 65 % mortality when fed at 2 mg g- 1 (ButaIT-GNA-(his) 6). Fusion proteins incorporating κ-ACTX and GNA were shown to be non-toxic despite individual components being functional. Lack of toxicity was due to high proteolytic cleavage in the insect gut environment. Data was obtained to support the use of Tribolium as a model for wireworm (Agriotes spp.), serious pests of potatoes in the UK. Selected fusion proteins were expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis. Expression for ButaIT-GNA as a fusion polypeptide was readily detectable in transformants with estimated levels of expression of approx. 0. 15 % total soluble protein in leaf tissue. When plants expressing ButaIT-GNA fusion protein were fed to larvae of the <b>tomato</b> <b>moth</b> (Lacanobia oleracea) the fusion protein was shown to be fully functional with levels of toxicity comparable to that seen in previous artificial diet bioassays. ω-ACTX based constructs expressed in Arabidopsis were subject to high levels of proteolytic cleavage in planta and so were not assayed for toxicity.
