We argue that such a multi-view labeling approach is a better fit for applications such as robotics and surveillance than traditional object recognition where only a single image of each scene is available. To encourage further study in the area, we have collected a data set of well-registered imagery for many indoor scenes and have made this data publicly available. Our multi-view labeling approach is capable of improving {{the results of a}} wide variety of image-based classifiers, and we demonstrate this by producing scene labelings based on the output of both the Deformable Parts Model of [1] as well as a method for recognizing object contours which is similar <b>to</b> <b>chamfer</b> matching.

The proposed antenna operates over a wideband from 2. 85 to 15. 4 GHz for voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR) less than two. Two modifications are introduced to enhance the frequency-impedance characteristic of the presented elliptical monopole antenna. The first one is <b>to</b> <b>chamfer</b> {{the edges of the}} ground plane with 45 °angle. The second modification is to use asymmetrical in length finite ground planes.

These bands are 3 - 4 GHz and 5 - 6 GHz used for WiMAX and WLAN operations. The center frequency and the width of the notch bands are adjusted by varying the length and the width of the slots.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of Shoulder versus Chamfer margin design on the marginal adaptation of zirconia (Zr) copings. Materials and Methods: 40 extracted molar teeth were mounted in resin and prepared for zirconia crowns with two margin preparation designs (20 =Shoulder and 20 =Chamfer). The copings were manufactured by Cercon® (DeguDent GmbH, Germany) using the CAD/CAM system for each tooth. They were tried on each tooth, cemented, thermocycled, re-embedded in resin and were subsequently cross sectioned centrally into two equal mesial and distal halves. They were examined under electron microscope at 200 X magnification and the measurements were recorded at 5 predetermined points in micrometers (µm). Results: The overall mean marginal gap for the two groups was found to be 206. 98 + 42. 78 µm with Shoulder margin design (Marginal Gap= 199. 50 + 40. 72 µm) having better adaptation compared <b>to</b> <b>Chamfer</b> (Marginal Gap= 214. 46 + 44. 85 µm).

40|$|For over 100 years, {{piston rings}} {{have been used}} in the {{internal}} combustion engine to create, during operation, a seal between the cylinder wall and the piston (Figure 1). In operation, the heat generated on the top ring, will cause the piston to deform and tilt. To accommodate with this effect, designers have improved the performance ring by applying a chamfer to the contact face of the ring to reduce the concentration of stress on the ring when the piston tilts (Figure 1). It can be found that the piston ring coatings (MoS 2 based) can lose structural integrity and state of the art rings incorporate a chamfer as shown in Figure 2 a, is <b>to</b> <b>chamfer</b> the coating on the ring contact face up to the substrate material. In the current design the coatings covers the full length of the chamfer which can lead to excessive stress concentration in A (Figure 2). This paper examines the effect of the contact chamfer and proposes a new solution to relieve active stress from the performance ring. Use of COMSOL Multiphysics: In operation, the piston ring is surrounded by gas acting on it, using effect of chamfer design has been considered using Love's equation in conjunction with Stone's equation for force ad Miler's equation for gas pressure modeling. Dimensional changes on the piston due to changes in thermodynamic and tilt created during BDC to TDC cycle generates stress concentration on A. Structural mechanic bloc from COMSOL has been used for the simulation where variables defined from (Love 1929; Mittler and Mierbach 2009; Neuber and Federhofer 1951; Stone and Ball 2004) equations. The chamfer geometry was controlled through variable inputs such as coating thickness, ring thickness, distance from the ring angle ring to cylinder to incorporate the tilt. The simulation has considered variables such as position, time to impact during contact between the cylinder liner and the piston ring coating. To better represents the two surfaces contacting a multiple meshing procedures. These procedures allows for the shearing process to simulate at 10, 000 rpm. COMSOL has enabled to generate a single simulation considering aspects mentioned above. Results: The results of this simulation confirmed ISO 6622 - 1 on dimensions for ring contact chamfer (Figure 4). When engine operate at 6, 000 to 12, 000 rpm localized high stresses are found on the contact chamfer face of the ring. With a new proposed designed (Figure 2 b) the concentrated stress at this point is reduced. Conclusion: The piston ring will go through several thermal dynamic changes inducing structural damage to the component. The present methodology has been to use to reduce highly localized stresses on chamfer placed on the contact face by reducing its dimension.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} jet flowing {{inside of}} a partially-open hydraulic valve {{is accompanied by a}} reaction force, also referred to as flow force. The nature of this force has remained a mystery despite an extensive research effort spanning many decades. The momentum theory on the flow force by Lee and Blackburn (1952) explains the origin of the flow force and offers a design solution to shape the valve spool as a turbine bucket. It provides a model to calculate the compensated flow force as well. This paper shows that the model applies to a different flow case due to incorrect assumptions made. A corrected equation is presented based on a detailed analysis of the static-pressure distribution in the valve cavity as well as on a literature review of pressure loss in diffusers and nozzles. The new equation is based on the compensation taking place upstream of the valve orifice, not downstream as assumed by the momentum theory.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the behavior of an edge chamfer on the resulting crushing response of flat laminated composite strips. The effects of variables such as chamfer angle, stacking sequence and material system were addressed. In the present study the material systems used was Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. Chamfer angles of 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° {{were used in the}} present study to simulate the trigger mechanism. Laminate stacking sequences of [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N (N= 4, 8 and 12), were studied using Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. In addition Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy specimens were fabricated with a [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S stacking sequence and tested. Monotonic and cyclic load-unload tests were conducted on an MTS electromechanical machine at a quasi-static stroke rate of 10 - 3 in/s. Monotonic tests were also conducted at stroke rates of 10 - 1 in/s, but restricted to the specimens with 45 ° chamfer specimen. Failure modes observed in [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S specimens included delamination induced lamina/ sub-laminate bending mode, laminate bending mode, brittle fracture mode, catastrophic failure mode, and mixed mode failures. Lamina/sub-laminate bending mode and brittle fracture mode were observed to be the most dominant failure modes, with corresponding high energy absorption. The amount of energy absorption through delamination in cyclic load-unload test was investigated using image analysis and geometry calculations. With an increase in chamfer angle, the peak load, in the load-displacement curve, increased for the 12 and 8 ply laminates, while no significant differences were observed in the 4 viii ply laminates. The load eccentricity due to chamfering forced a global bending dominated failure mode in 4 ply laminates, which resulted in the observed apparent insensitivity <b>to</b> <b>chamfer</b> angle. Due to the 0 ° fiber orientation in [0 º]N stacking sequence, a higher load carrying capacity was observed in comparison to [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S. However, the energy absorption in [± 45 º]N was higher owing to the crushing mode of failure rather than the delamination induced splaying/bending mode observed in [0 º]N laminates. Results from the load-displacement curve showed that the Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy had a higher load carrying capacity than carbon-fiber/epoxy, and this was attributed to the crushing mode being dominant in the fiberglass/epoxy specimens. Although, both fiberglass and carbon-fiber are brittle by nature, there was a shift in the initial load response from linear to non-linear behavior in the load-displacement curve of the [± 45 º]N stacking sequence. The sustained crush region of the load-displacement curves for the [0 º]N laminates exhibited high serrations typically associated with load oscillations in brittle failure. Cyclic load tests revealed the sequence of failure mechanisms in chamfered laminates. While delamination was observed to be the primary driving mechanism, the estimation of energy dissipated due to the same was observed to be small in comparison to the overall energy absorbed...|$|E
40|$|The grand goal of Computer Vision is to {{generate}} an automatic description {{of an image}} based on its visual content. Such a description would lead to many exciting capabilities, for example, searching through the images based on their visual content rather than the textual tags attached to the images. Images and videos take an ever increasing share of the total information content in archives and on the internet. Hence, such automatic descriptions would provide powerful tools for organizing and indexing {{by means of the}} visual content. Category level object detection is an important step in generating such automatic image descriptions. The major part of this thesis addresses the problems encountered in popular lines of approaches which utilize shape in various ways for object detection namely, i) Hough Voting, ii) Contour based Object Detection and iii) Chamfer Matching. The problems are tackled using the principles of emergence which states that the whole is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. Hough Voting methods are popular because they efficiently handle the high complexity of multi-scale, category-level object detection in cluttered scenes. However, the primary weakness of this approach is that mutually dependent local observations independently vote for intrinsically global object properties such as object scale. All the votes are added up to obtain object hypotheses. The assumption is thus that object hypotheses are a sum of independent part votes. Popular representation schemes are, however, based on an overlapping sampling of semi-local image features with large spatial support (e. g. SIFT or geometric blur). Features are thus mutually dependent. The question arises as to how to incorporate the feature dependences into Hough Voting framework. In this thesis, the feature dependencies are modelled by an objective function that combines three intimately related problems: i) grouping of mutually dependent parts, ii) solving the correspondence problem conjointly for dependent parts, and iii) finding concerted object hypotheses using extended groups rather than based on local observations alone. While Voting with dependent groups brings a significant improvement over standard Hough Voting, the interest points are still grouped in a query image during the detection stage. The grouping process can be made robust by grouping densely sampled interest points in training images yielding contours and evaluating the utility of contours over the full ensemble of training images. However, contour based object detection poses significant challenges for category-level object detection in cluttered scenes: Object form is an emergent property that cannot be perceived locally but becomes only available once the whole object has been detected and segregated from the background. To tackle this challenge, this thesis addresses the detection of objects and the assembling of their shape simultaneously, while avoiding fragile bottom-up grouping in query images altogether. Rather, the challenging problems of finding meaningful contours and discovering their spatially consistent placement are both shifted into the training stage. These challenges can be better handled using an ensemble of training samples rather than just a single query image. A dictionary of meaningful contours is then discovered using grouping based on co-activation patterns in all training images. Spatially consistent compositions of all contours are learned using maximum margin multiple instance learning. During recognition, objects are detected and their shape is explained simultaneously by optimizing a single cost function. For finding the placement of an object template or its part in an edge map, Chamfer matching is a widely used technique because of its simplicity and speed. However, it treats objects as being a mere sum of the distance transformation of all their contour pixels, thus leading to spurious matches. This thesis takes account of the fact that boundary pixels are not all equally important by applying a discriminative approach <b>to</b> <b>chamfer</b> distance computation, thereby increasing its robustness. While this improves the behaviour in the foreground, chamfer matching is still prone to accidental responses in spurious background clutter. To estimate the accidentalness of a match, a small dictionary of simple background contours is utilized. These background elements are trained to focus at locations where, relative to the foreground, typically accidental matches occur. Finally, a max-margin classifier is employed to learn the co-placement of all background contours and the foreground template. Both the contributions bring significant improvements over state-of-the-art chamfer matching on standard benchmark datasets. The final part of the thesis presents a case study where shape-based object representations provided semantic understanding of medieval manuscripts to art historians. To carry out the case study, a novel image dataset has been assembled from illuminations of 15 th century manuscripts with ground-truth information about various objects of artistic interest such as crowns, swords. An approach has been developed for automatically extracting potential objects (for e. g. crowns) from the large image collection, then analysing the intra-class variability of objects by means of a low dimensional embedding. With the help of the resultant plot, the art historians were able to confirm different artistic workshops within the manuscript and could verify the variations of art within a particular school. Obtaining such insights manually is a tedious task and one has to go through and analyse all the object types from all the pages of the manuscript. In addition, a semi-supervised approach has been developed for analysing the variations within an artistic workshop, and extended further to understand the transitions across artistic styles by means of 1 -d ordering of objects...|$|E

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for vehicles towing caravans to use more than double the fuel than normal. This massive increase in fuel usage is almost entirely due to the changed aerodynamics. This project focuses on improving the aerodynamics of a specific caravan with minimal impact on the useability and practicality of the caravan. The caravan’s current aerodynamic characteristics are evaluated and optimised using CFD software. The CFD software is utilised to perform a parametric study on specific areas of the caravan’s geometry to determine the optimum shape and size of specific features. Results found show that optimising the aerodynamics of the JPC caravan can reduce the drag forces by approximately 29. 5 % while having little impact on practical aspects of the caravan.
