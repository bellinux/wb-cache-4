Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E

5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) hesitates to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{murder case}} because he fears {{it will be}} too {{difficult}} to solve, so it is taken on by his partner Howard (Melissa Leo), who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases. They investigate the body of a man dead in a basement, and much to Felton's bewilderment, Howard solves the case easily. The owner of the house, Jerry Jempson (Jim Grollman), literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a police interview, during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} and rebuild {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped.

5|$|The {{disaster}} left Henry with no legitimate son, {{his various}} nephews now the closest male heirs. Henry {{announced he would}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> wife, Adeliza of Louvain, opening up {{the prospect of a}} new royal son, and the two were married at Windsor Castle in January 1121. Henry appears to have chosen her because she was attractive and came from a prestigious noble line. Adela seems to have been fond of Henry and joined him in his travels, probably to maximise the chances of her conceiving a child. The White Ship disaster initiated fresh conflict in Wales, where the drowning of Richard, Earl of Chester, encouraged a rebellion led by Maredudd ap Bleddyn. Henry intervened in North Wales that summer with an army and, although the King was hit by a Welsh arrow, the campaign reaffirmed royal power across the region.|$|E

5|$|Before {{leaving the}} band in 1984, Dade Farrar {{introduced}} {{its members to}} Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, {{a reference to a}} 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> approach and write their own music under their new name.|$|E
