In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council announced that a revamp of the Arms Park site would not include greyhound racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race.

5|$|In Grove, Nichols {{divides the}} chamber works into three clearly {{differentiated}} periods. The first four sonatas {{come from the}} early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo divertissements alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity– less <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> each– their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the Rapsodie nègre, FP 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano (1926).|$|E

Next, Rollins lost a singles match to Randy Orton. Then, Triple H defeated Sting in another singles match. A tag match followed where AJ Lee teamed with Paige to defeat Nikki Bella and Brie Bella. Next, Cena scored another WrestleMania victory, this time at the expense of Rusev, while Cena captured the United States Championship. In the penultimate match, the Undertaker (in his return to TV) defeated Bray Wyatt.

Introducing a very small loop cache into the instruction memory hierarchy has thus been shown to substantially reduce instruction fetch energy.

We therefore introduce a loop cache exploration tool that analyzes a particular program’s profile, explores the possible configurations, and generates the configuration with the greatest power savings. We introduce a simulation-based approach and show the good energy savings that a customized loop cache yields. Furthermore, we also introduce a fast estimation-based approach that obtains nearly the same results in seconds rather <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of <b>minutes</b> or hours. i...|$|R

40|$|Peptide {{antibodies}} specific for tyrosinated (tyr-tubulin) or detyrosinated alpha-tubulin (glu-tubulin) {{have been}} generated {{for studying the}} relative stability of microtubules enriched in either form of alpha-tubulin. Treatment of Vero cells with nocodazole has revealed that interphase microtubules rich in glu-tubulin (glu-microtubules) are resistant to higher concentrations of the microtubule-disrupting drug than the microtubules containing only tyr-tubulin (tyr-microtubules). Glu-tubulin is enriched in centrioles and mid-bodies, but absent from the first interphase microtubules that have repolymerized in late telophase. Tubulin (including both forms) has been labeled with rhodamine (rh-tubulin) and microinjected into Vero cells to study in vivo the dynamic properties and incorporation rates of tubulin into microtubules rich in either glu- or tyr-tubulin. Tyr-microtubules are significantly more rapidly labeled by the microinjected rh-tubulin <b>than</b> glu-microtubules. <b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> after injection, rh-tubulin is present in virtually all tyr-microtubules. The half-time of turnover of glu-microtubules is approximately 1 h.

These results suggest that tyr- and glu-microtubules respectively represent relatively dynamic and stable subclasses of interphase microtubules...|$|R
