5|$|The last {{eruption}} of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BCE); {{because of this}} inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which {{is given to the}} extinct volcano Kohala). <b>Twenty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000 years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.|$|E
5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of <b>twenty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E

5|$|The brain consumes up to <b>twenty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{energy used}} by the human body, {{more than any other}} organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{roads were}} in poor {{condition}} when Combs became governor. The Automotive Safety Foundation found {{that two-thirds of}} Kentucky's federal roads were below standards for existing traffic demands. It further found that <b>twenty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's major city streets were inadequate, that another fifty-five percent would soon be inadequate due to increasing traffic, and {{that half of the}} state's secondary roads were unfit for modern industrial traffic. To address these problems, Combs issued $100million in bonds to increase funding for highways, appointing Earle Clements as state highway commissioner to oversee the correction of the road issues. One of the new roads, the Mountain Parkway, which connected Combs' native Eastern Kentucky to Central Kentucky, was later renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in Combs' honor. Because of generous funding in Combs' budget, Kentucky finished its portions of the Interstate Highway System much sooner than surrounding states such as Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E

This makes it an important resource that can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of surface water, as in during times of drought.|$|E
25|$|The eight-hour day {{might have}} been {{realised}} for many working people in the US in 1937, when what became the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S. Code Chapter 8) was first proposed under the New Deal.
