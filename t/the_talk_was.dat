5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{the temple}} {{broadcast}} a talk of Luang Por Dhammajayo {{about what happened}} to Steve Jobs after his death. The talk came as a response to a software engineer of Apple who had sent a letter with questions to the abbot. Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven. He said that Jobs had been reborn as a deva living close to his former offices, {{as a result of the}} karma of having given knowledge to people. <b>The</b> <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> much criticized, and the abbot was accused of pretending to have attained an advanced meditative state and of attempting to outshine other temples. The temple stated that <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> meant to illustrate the law of karma, not to defame Jobs, nor to fake an advanced state.|$|E

25|$|Logical {{notions of}} higher order: While Tarski {{confined}} his discussion to operations of first-order logic, {{there is nothing}} about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic.

So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1930s {{and until}} his death, Douglas {{maintained}} correspondences with many people, including Marie Stopes and George Bernard Shaw.

One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the Royal Society of Literature on 2 September 1943, entitled The Principles of Poetry, {{which was published in}} an edition of 1,000 copies.

25|$|In Fairfax County <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> {{of little}} else. The issue of states' rights became {{a subject of}} much discussion. Feelings and {{differences}} hardened. Events far to the south framed the debate almost in an almost electrify manner. South Carolina seceded from the Union in December 1860, followed in quick order by several other Deep South states. In Virginia the viewpoint was much more moderate. Many called for calm and appealed for peace. The matter was put to a referendum on May 23, 1861 and Virginians went to polling stations to decide {{the future of the}} Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|When John Lossing Buck {{took the}} family to Ithaca the next year, Pearl {{accepted}} an invitation to address a luncheon of Presbyterian women at the Astor Hotel in New York City. Her talk was titled “Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?” and her answer was a barely qualified “no”. She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant {{in their attempts to}} control it. When <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> published in Harper's magazine, the scandalized reaction led Pearl to resign her position with the Presbyterian Board. In 1934, Pearl left China, believing she would return, while John Lossing Buck remained.|$|E

The presentation also included images of the bronze statues of the National War Memorial of Canada. In 2011, an exhibition {{was held at the}} Bromley Museum at The Priory in Orpington, Bromley. The exhibition featured the work of local artists, and included scale models by members of the March family. A black and white, silent movie filmed in 1924 followed the March artists as they worked in their studios at Goddendene, and has been reproduced by British Pathé.|$|E

25|$|Playing on {{the squad}} {{led by the}} 26-year-old superstar Kaká in {{addition}} to several other world-class players {{at or near the}} peak of their careers – 28-year-old Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico. Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start. Going into Beckham's home debut versus Fiorentina a week later, all <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> around Kaká being the target of a reported £100million transfer bid by Manchester City. Beckham turned in another understated performance {{on the right side of}} midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.|$|E

500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>was</b> described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
