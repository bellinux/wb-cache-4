25|$|Most {{studies show}} no {{benefit from the}} {{addition}} of chemotherapy. However, a large clinical trial of 575 participants randomized to standard radiation versus radiation plus <b>temozolomide</b> chemotherapy showed that the group receiving <b>temozolomide</b> survived a median of 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the group receiving radiation alone. This treatment regime is now standard for most cases of glioblastoma where the person is not enrolled in a clinical trial. <b>Temozolomide</b> seems to work by sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} <b>temozolomide</b> in {{high-grade}} gliomas yield low toxicity, {{but the results}} are comparable to the standard doses.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecule}} called VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol) {{is being}} studied {{to see if}} it helps in glioblastoma that is no longer responsive to <b>temozolomide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{electric}} field therapy is an FDA-approved therapy for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. In 2015, initial {{results from a}} phase-three randomized clinical trial of alternating {{electric field}} therapy plus <b>temozolomide</b> in newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a three-month improvement in progression-free survival, and a five-month improvement in overall survival compared to <b>temozolomide</b> therapy alone, representing the first large trial in a decade to show a survival improvement in this setting. Despite these results, the efficacy of this approach remains controversial among medical experts.|$|E
25|$|Various {{chemotherapy}} agents, including <b>temozolomide,</b> dacarbazine (also termed DTIC), immunotherapy (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN)), as well {{as local}} perfusion, are used by different centers. The overall success in metastatic melanoma is quite limited.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{benefits}} {{have also been}} associated with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and <b>temozolomide</b> chemotherapy. However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of <b>temozolomide</b> chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms that younger age {{is associated with a}} much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. The population-based cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no clear}} way to prevent the disease. Typically, {{treatment}} involves surgery, after which chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used. The medication <b>temozolomide</b> is used frequently as part of chemotherapy. High dose steroids {{may be used to}} help reduce swelling and decrease symptoms. It is unclear whether trying to remove all or simply most of the cancer, is better.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier poses a {{difficult}} obstacle to pass to deliver chemotherapy to the brain. This {{is because the}} brain has an extensive system in place {{to protect it from}} harmful chemicals. Drug transporters can pump out drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood circulation. These transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small lipophilic alkylating agents such as lomustine or <b>temozolomide</b> are able to cross this blood–brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and <b>temozolomide.</b> Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|A good initial Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) and MGMT {{methylation}} {{are associated}} with longer survival. A DNA test can be conducted on glioblastomas {{to determine whether or}} not the promoter of the MGMT gene is methylated. Patients with a methylated MGMT promoter have longer survival than those with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, due in part to increased sensitivity to <b>temozolomide.</b> This DNA characteristic is intrinsic to the patient and currently cannot be altered externally. Another positive prognostic marker for glioblastoma patients is mutation of the IDH1 gene, which can be tested by DNA-based methods or by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against the most common mutation, namely IDH1-R132H.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to surgery, {{radiotherapy}} {{becomes the}} mainstay of treatment for people with glioblastoma. It is typically performed along with giving <b>temozolomide</b> (TMZ). A pivotal clinical trial {{carried out in the}} early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or nonradiation therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not. Subsequent clinical research has attempted to build on the backbone of surgery followed by radiation. On average, radiotherapy after surgery can reduce the tumor size to 107 cells. Whole-brain radiotherapy does not improve when compared to the more precise and targeted three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. A total radiation dose of 60–65 Gy {{has been found to be}} optimal for treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} alteration is methylation of MGMT, a [...] "suicide" [...] DNA repair enzyme. Methylation {{is described}} to impair DNA transcription and therefore, {{expression of the}} MGMT enzyme. Since an MGMT enzyme can only repair one DNA alkylation due to its suicide repair mechanism, reverse capacity is low and methylation of the MGMT gene promoter greatly affects DNA-repair capacity. Indeed, MGMT methylation is associated with an improved response to treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as <b>temozolomide.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effect is bone marrow suppression. The most common non-hematological adverse effects {{associated}} with <b>temozolomide</b> are nausea and vomiting, which are either self-limiting or readily controlled with standard antiemetic therapy. These latter effects are usually {{mild to moderate}} (grade 1 to 2). The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting is around 4% each. Patients who have pre-existing or a history of severe vomiting may require antiemetic therapy before initiating <b>temozolomide</b> treatment. <b>Temozolomide</b> should be administered in the fasting state, at least one hour before a meal. Antiemetic therapy may be administered before, or following, administration of <b>temozolomide.</b> <b>Temozolomide</b> is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to its components or to dacarbazine. The use of <b>temozolomide</b> is not recommended in patients with severe myelosuppression.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Temozolomide</b> is {{effective}} for treating Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) compared to radiotherapy alone. A 2013 meta-analysis showed that <b>Temozolomide</b> prolongs survival and delays progression, but {{is associated with}} an increase in side effects such as blood complications, fatigue, and infection. [...] For people with recurrent GBM, when comparing <b>temozolomide</b> with chemotherapy, there may be an improvement in the time-to-progression and the person's quality of life, but no improvement in overall survival, with <b>temozolomide</b> treatment.|$|E
50|$|Lonidamine {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of brain tumours in combination with radiotherapy and <b>temozolomide.</b> An in-vitro study showed that a combination of <b>temozolomide</b> and lonidamine at clinically achievable, low plasma concentrations, could inhibit tumour growth, and lonidamine could reduce the dose of <b>temozolomide</b> required for radiosensitization of brain tumours.|$|E
5000|$|Some sources {{explicitly}} {{exclude the}} triazenes (dacarbazine, mitozolomide, <b>temozolomide)</b> from the nonclassical category. However, other sources list dacarbazine as nonclassical, and some include <b>temozolomide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Temozolomide</b> is genotoxic, {{teratogenic}} and fetotoxic {{and should}} not be used during pregnancy.Lactating women should discontinue nursing while receiving the drug because of the risk of secretion into breast milk.One study indicated that women that have taken <b>temozolomide</b> without concomitant fertility preservation measures achieve pregnancy to a lesser rate later in life, but the study was too small to show statistical significance in the hypothesis that <b>temozolomide</b> would confer a risk of female infertility.In male patients, <b>temozolomide</b> can have genotoxic effects. Men are advised not to father a child during or up to six months after treatment and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to <b>temozolomide</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|The {{therapeutic}} benefit of <b>temozolomide</b> {{depends on its}} ability to alkylate/methylate DNA, which most often occurs at the N-7 or O-6 positions of guanine residues. This methylation damages the DNA and triggers the death of tumor cells. However, some tumor cells are able to repair this type of DNA damage, and therefore diminish the therapeutic efficacy of <b>temozolomide,</b> by expressing a protein O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) encoded in humans by the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. In some tumors, epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene prevents the synthesis of this enzyme, and as a consequence such tumors are more sensitive to killing by <b>temozolomide.</b> Conversely, the presence of AGT protein in brain tumors predicts poor response to <b>temozolomide</b> and these patients receive little benefit from chemotherapy with <b>temozolomide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A mutational {{analysis}} of 23 initial-low grade gliomas and recurrent tumors {{from the same}} patients has challenged the benefits and usage of <b>Temozolomide.</b> The study showed that when lower grade brain tumors of patients are removed and patients are further treated with <b>Temozolomide,</b> 6 out of 10 times the recurrent tumors were more aggressive and acquired alternative and more mutations. As {{one of the last}} authors, Costello, stated [...] "They had a 20- to 50-fold {{increase in the number of}} mutations. A patient who received surgery alone who might have had 50 mutations in the initial tumor and 60 in the recurrence. But patients who received TMZ might have 2,000 mutations in the recurrence." [...] Further, new mutations were verified to carry known signatures of <b>Temozolomide</b> induced mutations. The research suggests that <b>Temozolomide</b> for the treatment of certain brain tumors should be thoroughly thought. Unjudicious usage of <b>Temozolomide</b> might lower the prognosis of the patients further, or increase their burden. Further understanding of the mechanisms of <b>Temozolomide</b> induced mutations and novel combination approaches could be promising.|$|E
50|$|Because {{tumor cells}} that express the MGMT gene are more {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} <b>temozolomide,</b> researchers investigated whether the inclusion of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG), an AGT inhibitor, could overcome this resistance and improve the drug's therapeutic effectiveness. In the laboratory, this combination indeed showed increased <b>temozolomide</b> activity in tumor-cell culture in vitro and in animal models in vivo. However, a recently completed phase-II clinical trial with brain-tumor patients yielded mixed outcomes; while there was some improved therapeutic activity when O6-BG and <b>temozolomide</b> were given to patients with temozolomide-resistant anaplastic glioma, {{there seemed to be no}} significant restoration of <b>temozolomide</b> sensitivity in patients with temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma multiforme.|$|E
50|$|While the {{above-mentioned}} approaches have investigated whether {{the combination of}} <b>temozolomide</b> with other agents might improve therapeutic outcome, efforts have also started to study whether altering the <b>temozolomide</b> molecule itself can increase its activity. One such approach permanently fused perillyl alcohol, a natural compound with demonstrated therapeutic activity in brain cancer patients, to the <b>temozolomide</b> molecule. The resultant novel compound, called NEO212 or TMZ-POH, revealed anticancer activity that was significantly {{greater than that of}} either of its two parent molecules, <b>temozolomide</b> and perillyl alcohol. Although , NEO212 has not been tested in humans, it has shown superior cancer therapeutic activity in animal models of glioma, melanoma, and brain metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer.|$|E

50|$|Cilengitide is well tolerated, in {{combination}} with radiation and <b>temozolomide,</b> at a dose of 2000 mg in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, regardless of MGMT promoter status. In a phase I/IIa study, the addition of cilengitide to the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (surgical resection followed by <b>temozolomide</b> and radiation therapy) improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with MGMT promoter methylation.|$|E
5000|$|Laboratory {{studies and}} {{clinical}} trials have started investigating {{the possibility of}} increasing the anticancer potency of <b>temozolomide</b> by combining it with other pharmacologic agents.

Laboratory studies found that <b>temozolomide</b> killed brain tumor cells more efficiently when epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a component of green tea, was added; however, the efficacy of this effect has not yet been confirmed in brain-tumor patients.
