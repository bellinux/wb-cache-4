5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach.

Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently fell back.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime {{during the second half of}} the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E

The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
