5|$|In 1888, Nobel was {{astonished}} to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, <b>the</b> <b>obituary</b> was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.|$|E
5|$|Historians differ {{over whether}} Walter ever married, but agree {{that he died}} childless. Michael Altschul lists no wife in {{his work on the}} Clares, and C. Warren Hollister, {{revising}} J. Horace Rounds entry in the Dictionary of National Biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, states that it is unclear if Walter married. Jennifer Ward, however, states that Walter married Isabella, a daughter of Ralph de Tosny. Katharine Keats-Rohan states that Walter married Isabel, a daughter of Ralph de Tosny, and states that his widow gave an endowment to the cathedral chapter of Salisbury Cathedral for the sake of Walter's soul. Walter was alive at Easter in 1136, but died after that date. <b>The</b> <b>obituary</b> for Walter from Tintern gives his death date as 10 March, but does not state a year. A date of 1138 is usually given for his death; though this has not been proven, it is likely. His estates passed to his nephew Gilbert de Clare, son of his brother Gilbert, who had died around 1115.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of rarity (perceived or known), condition, completeness and originality determines the price a collector {{is willing to}} pay for any given edition. Rarity arguably has the strongest influence on value as editions known to be very rare (e.g. those published in the periods when paper restrictions applied during both World Wars) are very much more expensive than comparable editions from the surrounding decades. Editions such as the 1916 containing <b>the</b> <b>obituary</b> and career details of W. G. Grace; 1934, detailing the 'Bodyline' series of 1932–33; 1949, the Australian 'Invincibles' tour of 1948; 1965, the first to have a yellow dust jacket: All are rare and expensive for specific reasons.|$|E
25|$|Barnet Burns died on 26 December 1860 at Eldad, East Stonehouse, Plymouth. The death {{certificate}} stated that George Barnet Burns, lecturer, {{died at age}} 53 {{and the cause of}} death was morbus cordis cirrhosis of liver ascites. There were various times during his life when Burns had been found drunk and it seems that he finally succumbed to his alcoholism. His obituary stated that Barnet Burns was better known as Pahe-a-Range, the New Zealand Chief, that he had suffered a long and painful illness and that he left behind a widow and two children to lament their loss. The identities of the children mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>obituary</b> are not known.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>obituary</b> of Wason {{written for}} The Times newspaper, he was {{described}} as a political Radical. He was said to be a frequent speaker in the House of Commons (unlike his brother Cathcart) and usually gave expression to advanced radical views. On one important radical issue of the day, women’s suffrage, he himself claimed to have always voted in favour. His support of Home Rule all Round was also indicative of radical sentiments. However, after he left Parliament, in the days when the old Liberal tradition was collapsing under the strains and stresses of party splits, the confusion of the electorate as to Liberal policy and the massive expansion of the electorate {{as a result of the}} Representation of the People Act 1918, Wason’s radicalism was tested. At the general elections of 1923 and 1924 in Wason’s home area of South Ayrshire no Liberal candidate could be persuaded to stand, leaving a straight fight between Labour and Conservative parties.|$|E

25|$|Kyaw Nyein's date of 1910 can be {{considered}} as the more plausible date. First, Kyaw Nyein had access to historical records and he interviewed many surviving members of the Thirty Comrades when he wrote the book in the mid-to late 1990s. (Ne Win was one of the Thirty Comrades who secretly went to undergo military training in Japanese-occupied Hainan Island in the early 1940s for the purpose of fighting for independence from the British). In his book published around 1998, Kyaw Nyein lists the names of the surviving members of the Thirty Comrades whom he had interviewed, although Ne Win was not one of them.) Secondly, when Ne Win died on 5 December 2002, the Burmese language newspapers that were allowed to carry a paid obituary stated the age of 'U Ne Win' to be '93 years'. According to Burmese custom, a person's age is their age upon their next birthday. Since Ne Win turned 92 in July 2002, when he died in December 2002 he was considered to be 93 years old. Most Western news agencies, based on the May 1911 birth date, reported that Ne Win was 91 years old, but <b>the</b> <b>obituary</b> put up by his family (most probably his children) stated that he was 93 years old, which most likely stems from East Asian age reckoning.|$|E
