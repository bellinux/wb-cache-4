5|$|Cabeza de Vaca {{is thought}} to have been the first European to sight the bay in the early 16th century, {{evidenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> in his logs that match the detail of the area.

He named it Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic), but it was later changed to Copano, after the port of Copano was officially opened in 1785 on the northwestern shore. The port later served as a strategically important locale during the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, and was the site of a settlement that is now completely abandoned. The town of St. Mary's of Aransas was founded southwest of Copano and thrived as a port and wood mart, until numerous shipwrecks caused by the bay's hidden reefs concluded its use in 1875.

5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> of {{the rules}} above, two {{important}} properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set of cells with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, it does have a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. <b>The</b> <b>descriptions</b> of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to the attention of a wide audience for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit to marvel at the Sea of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in {{exchange}} for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be.
