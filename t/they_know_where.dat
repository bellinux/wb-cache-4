25|$|Many street {{children}} spend 300 rupees {{a month on}} movies, though older children also use their money to buy cigarettes, chewing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Street children often spend very little on clothing because their employers often provide clothes for work or their families occasionally give them clothes if <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they are living. Also, the boys among them do not mind wandering fully or partially naked in public because it adds to the people's sympathy for them.|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, it is {{time for}} the {{ceremony}} for the [...] "Worker of the Week" [...] award and Homer, the only employee who has never won the award, is confident he will win. However, Mr. Burns gives the award to an [...] "inanimate carbon rod". The dejected Homer, feeling that no one respects him, turns to TV for solace and comes across a live space shuttle launch, which he finds dull. Meanwhile, NASA, frustrated over its drop in the Nielsen ratings, decides to send an [...] "average shmoe" [...] into space as the solution. At that moment, Homer telephones NASA to complain about their [...] "boring space launches", as well as asking if <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he can find some Tang, and NASA chiefs realize they have found their man. When they arrive at Moe's Tavern in search of Homer, who is currently calling Bill Clinton to ask about Tang, he believes he is in trouble for making a prank call to NASA and blames Barney for the incident. The NASA employees ask Barney to be an astronaut, and when Homer realizes what the proposal entails, he steps in and takes credit for the call.|$|E

According to Rupert Scofield, FINCA's President and CEO, [...] "women have historically proved to be better credit risks, as they tend to be more responsible, perhaps from having {{to take care of the}} children. And frankly, they tend to be more creative and risk-taking than the men.

2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E
