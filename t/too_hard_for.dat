5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E

25|$|After further ocean landing tests, {{the first}} stage of the CRS-5 launch vehicle {{attempted}} to land on a floating platform, the autonomous spaceport drone ship, in January 2015. The rocket guided itself to the ship successfully but landed <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> survival. The first stage of the CRS-6 mission managed a soft landing on the platform; however, excess lateral velocity caused it to quickly tip over and explode. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated that a throttle valve for the engine was stuck and did not respond quickly enough to achieve a smooth landing.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to find an}} {{impartial}} jury in Letcher County, the trial was moved to Harlan County, where it was held in March 1968. The prosecution was led by Commonwealth's Attorney Daniel Boone Smith, who recalled that even in Harlan County it was assumed he would not push <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Ison's conviction, since many locals approached him to express sympathy for Ison. Boone said his task was to convince the jurors that O'Connor and his crew were respectable {{people who had been}} commissioned by the United States Government to make a film about the entire United States, and that the Kentucky shots would only be briefly featured.|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E

500|$|In November 1944, Kinkaid {{relieved}} Christie {{of command}} of submarine operations at Fremantle, and assigned {{the position to}} Fife commencing 30 December. Although no specific reason was given, Christie was convinced {{it was because he}} pushed Kinkaid <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Dealey's Medal of Honor, and for his process of awarding decorations in general. However, Christie's losses, which included Dealey and Kinkaid's nephew, Lieutenant Commander Manning Kimmel in [...] in July 1944, may have also influenced Kinkaid's decision.|$|E
500|$|Taft was a {{supporter}} of settling international disputes by arbitration, and he negotiated treaties with Great Britain and with France [...] providing that differences be arbitrated. These were signed in August 1911. Neither Taft nor Knox (a former senator) consulted {{with members of the}} Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft and the president felt that lobbying <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements.|$|E

Kubicek raved that Mercedes [...] "gave 100% of {{what she has to}} offer, which is pure greatness", and Respers France said she [...] "stole the night" [...] and was [...] "amazing". Berk broke his own scale of one to five stars with six stars, and praised [...] "the unstinting instrument that is Mercedes' voice". Gonzalez gave it an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "pure perfection", but Benigno was more restrained with a [...] "B+", and wrote [...] "she hits a little <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> my taste" [...] and [...] "the vocals … threaten to engulf the song itself".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, as a [...] "relatively short-lived" [...] experiment, {{the group}} {{franchised}} its concept to other countries.

[...] The Taiwanese group was successful, so they branched out to Latin America, casting Spanish-speaking Australians. [...] The Wiggles ceased to pursue additional franchising when they learned that viewers in other countries preferred the original versions of their songs and programs because they helped children learn English, and according to Cook, when it became <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them to control, and when it [...] "did not prove lucrative".

Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: [...] "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank <b>too</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>for</b> Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton.

500|$|In January 2008 Bob Bindschadler (NASA) {{landed on}} the {{floating}} ice shelf of PIG, this is at the downstream end where it floats on the sea. This landing, by a Twin Otter plane fitted with skis, was the first ever landing on this ice shelf. The reason for landing on the ice shelf was for a reconnaissance mission to investigate the feasibility of drilling through around [...] of ice, to lower instruments into the ocean cavity below. It is hoped that this will provide important information on {{the link between the}} ocean and Pine Island Glacier. It was decided that the small crevasse free area was <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> further landings and so further fieldwork had to be postponed. Therefore, two GPS units and a weather station were positioned as near as possible to PIG.|$|E
500|$|Skis {{designed}} for classic technique, both {{in track and}} in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] or [...] "kick zone", underfoot. This comes either from a) texture, designed to slide forward but not backwards, that {{is built into the}} grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from grip waxes. Grip waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions). Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction. Hard grip waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called klister.|$|E
500|$|Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, {{disagrees with}} Tetlow, writing that its only unity {{consists}} of similarities in tone and {{style and the}} recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural unity that might have existed. He blames the war, {{saying that it was}} <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Hemingway to write about it cohesively, that it was [...] "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, [...] "discrete glimpses into hell... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." [...] The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.|$|E

500|$|Farber further said {{he found}} {{similarities}} between the songs on The Open Door and the works of Mariah Carey, Sarah Brightman, Nickelback and Annie Haslam. The Sydney Morning Herald felt [...] "the band's symphonic metal tunes and dark-hearted lyrics are gloomier than ever". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "too pop for some and <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> others", while describing the lyrics as [...] "youthfully earnest and sometimes obvious". In his review of The Open Door, Jon Dolan of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The music {{is still the same}} crush of chunka-chunka riffs, moody electronic churn, and Valhalla-bound metal slam, all in service of Lee's strikingly operatic singing". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe said the songs on the album are similar to the band's [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] (2003) and [...] "Going Under" [...] (2003), with the [...] "mix of Lee's ethereal soprano, piano interludes, and layers of serrated guitar crunch that conjure visions of Sarah McLachlan fronting Godsmack". Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield compared Lee's vocals with those of 1980s [...] "shoulder-pad belters" [...] like Pat Benatar and Ann Wilson of Heart. Christianity Todays Andree Farias called the album [...] "an extension of what the band has done before. Industrial backbeats give way to thick metal riffs, orchestrated grandeur, and ghoulish choral elements, all complemented by Lee's operatic soprano". Billboard said Evanescence has [...] "translated [...] heartache into another successful set of melodramatic goth/industrial anthems with touches of prog and even classical [...] ".|$|E

The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it makes me sick, I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may {{have had something to}} do with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice complimented [...] "I Was Here" [...] as {{knocking}} {{harder than}} anything on 4s [...] "bloated predecessor", I Am ... Sasha Fierce (2008).

[...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club described [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "uncomfortably overwrought" [...] although he said that Beyoncé manages to bring conviction to its lyrical content. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a mixed review stating that it reached a [...] "lifetime-movie levels of schmaltz". David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "I Was Here" [...] is [...] "plain awkward to here a woman as in her prime physically as Beyoncé is to even approach such a tune. The dull music from Ryan Tedder and an army of co-producers does not help matters." [...] Michael Cragg of The Observer gave the song a negative review, stating that it disappoints as being [...] "corny bluster at odds with the laid-back feel of her most accomplished album yet." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent simply stated that [...] "I Was Here" [...] strains <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) status. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune described the song as a [...] "toxic string of cliches".
