From this terminus, the highway {{proceeds}} as a two-lane, paved road, which travels through a small parking lot and turns northeastward. The road continues northeast as it passes <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Canyon Marina and <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Canyon Colonia camping area on {{the eastern edge of}} the park, as well as several houses and independent camp sites. The highway intersects Cam Real Road, which leads to the Devils Shores community and the surrounding area. The route bends eastward, passing <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Canyon Inn and a small parking lot and intersecting a small road before it continues into rural areas again. Proceeding along a small ridge, the highway bends northeastward and travels over a small unnamed wash before reaching its eastern terminus with US277/US377.|$|E

50|$|After {{dewatering}} using Multotec cyclones, two Holmans Wilfley shaking {{tables are}} used to produce a rougher table concentrate. This concentrate is sized at 90 micron using a Derrick screen and dewatered using cyclones followed by two further steps of cleaning/recleaning (also on Holmans Wilfley shaking tables) to produce the final coarse and fine gravity concentrate. The tailings and middling from <b>the</b> <b>rougher</b> table reports back to <b>the</b> <b>rougher</b> spiral feed, whilst cleaner table middlings/tailings are sent back to <b>the</b> <b>rougher</b> tables and re-cleaner table middlings and tailings are {{sent back to the}} cleaner tables.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids.

The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E

40|$|In rough {{machining}} of parts with sculptured surfaces, two main objectives are usually considered: machining time and overall removed material {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>roughing</b> phase. <b>The</b> outcome of that phase is critical for the subsequent finishing phase. This paper proposes a method for measuring roughed part quality through calculation of the local difference between <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> part geometry and the ideally finished part geometry. The method calculates the height from a point lying on <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> surface to its projection on the ideally finished part surface. Using the API of a CAD system for this purpose proves computationally inefficient. Therefore, a mean distance between a triangle of <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> surface triangular mesh and the ideally finished part surface region lying in a suitable envelope is calculated instead. The calculation is repeated not for all triangles of the mesh, but for a sample as low as 3 %, which, according to the Levene statistical test suffices, thereby, reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. The method ultimately yields a single figure, i. e. the standard deviation of local differences between <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> and finished part, normalized by the mean difference. The concept was tested on sculptured surface parts of various mechanical and operational properties and was proven efficient in all test cases...|$|R

5|$|Many {{types of}} cells export {{proteins}} produced by ribosomes attached to <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become {{embedded in the}} membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able {{to pass through the}} membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and modification.|$|E
