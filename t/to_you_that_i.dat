500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E

2500|$|The letter Dwyer {{had sent}} to Casey stated, among other things, [...] "By {{the time you}} receive this letter...the office of State Treasurer of Pennsylvania will be vacant. I stress <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not resign but was State Treasurer of Pennsylvania to the end." [...] Also, that Casey [...] "will be the great Governor that Pennsylvania needs {{at this time in}} our history." [...] He {{suggested}} his wife Joanne as the successor to Treasurer of Pennsylvania, describing her as [...] "very talented, personable, organized and hard-working." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the morning}} {{following}} his resignation, {{he woke up}} much earlier than usual {{and sat on the}} balcony meditating. His wife tried to console him for losing his premiership position. He famously replied: [...] "I’m not worried about the premiership, but I’m worried about how to announce <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will have to cancel our telephone subscription for lack of money in my possession given the fact that my law firm has been closed for eight months and I am without clients." [...] He is famous for having once said to a man who asked him to join a prolific business project [...] "I would never even dare give the chance to the smallest villager in the most remote town to even think that I made a benefit of one penny".|$|E
2500|$|Holmes was {{partially}} modelled on his former university teacher Joseph Bell. In 1892, {{in a letter}} to Bell, Doyle wrote, [...] "It is most certainly <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> owe Sherlock Holmes... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man," [...] and, in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, [...] "It is no wonder that after the study of such a character [...] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal." [...] Robert Louis Stevenson was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: [...] "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?" [...] Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, the famous Edgar Allan Poe character C. Auguste Dupin. Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle's, Dr James Watson.|$|E

[...] "I am greatly obliged to you," [...] she said, [...] "for giving me your {{confidence}} in this way, and <b>I</b> want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall be thoroughly loyal <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never will breathe anything you have said. But I also want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not change any of my opinions. Now we understand each other, don't we?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Set Fire to the Rain" [...] is {{the fifth}} track on Adele's second album 21. It was written with {{producer}} Fraser T Smith. It is written in the key of D minor with a tempo of 108 beats per minute, following the chord progression of Dm–F–C–Gm–Dm–F–C–Csus4–C, and Adele's voice spans A3-D5. The song describes the contradictory elements of a relationship, and the impossibility of letting go which is displayed in the lyrics [...] "You and me together, nothing gets better/But there’s a side <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never knew, never knew/All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true/And the games you play, you would always win." [...] One of the most pop-influenced of the album, the song is characterised by John Murphy of MusicOMH as a [...] "power ballad". In contrast to the understated production of most songs on the album, the song features lush instrumentation and a swelling string arrangement over a mid-tempo rhythm, creating a wall of sound for the singer's mourning vocals. Dave Simpson of The Guardian in an article revealed that Adele got inspiration for the song [...] "when mah lightah stopped workin' [...] " [...] in the wet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the {{daughter}} of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) {{were told by}} Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father. On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: [...] "I am {{not in the least}} astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> in any way suspected." [...] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: [...] "I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was." [...] In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: first, from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs—and secondly, her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband. She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.|$|E
