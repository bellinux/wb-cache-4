25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
500|$|Ferraro {{continued}} {{to engage the}} issue and criticize the Obama campaign via her position as a Fox News Channel contributor. By early April, Ferraro said people were deluging her with negative comments {{and trying to get}} her removed from one of the boards she was on: [...] "This has been the worst three weeks of my life." [...] Ferraro stated in mid- that Clinton had [...] "raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ran". She thought Obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that she might not vote for him.|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{had three}} {{children}}: Billie Ann {{by his first}} wife; David and Steven by his second wife Charlotte Blythe Dunn, and no children with his third wife Elaine (née Lewis). Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer, winning two World Grand Championships, the first before his father won one. Steve Dunn's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989, and Out On Parole in 2002. Bud and Steve Dunn remain the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992, three years after his son's first, Steve said, [...] "I think him winning meant more to me <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> won it." [...] Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve, [...] "I always wanted him to work out here. But ain't many fathers and sons ever got along that long." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Ramsey was conscripted into the British Army on 24 June 1940. He was assigned to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and underwent his initial training in Truro, where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure. [...] "Until I travelled to Cornwall, the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to Brighton by train," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was the first time I had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel." [...] "That set the tone for Alf's war," [...] Leo McKinstry suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties. The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him [...] "a fitter young fellow <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham".|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took a little time to grow on me. I liked it better on the show <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard it by itself, which is weird because it's exactly the same thing. Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a sucker for a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'. I'm sure they could one day, but this one fell a bit short for me musically. [...] In the context of the show, however, it was a great moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Escaping to Parma, Casanova {{entered into}} a three-month affair with a Frenchwoman he named [...] "Henriette", perhaps the deepest love he ever experienced—a woman who {{combined}} beauty, intelligence, and culture. In his words, [...] "They who believe that a woman is incapable of making a man equally happy all the twenty-four {{hours of the day}} have never known an Henriette. The joy which flooded my soul was far greater when I conversed with her during the day <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> held her in my arms at night. Having read a great deal and having natural taste, Henriette judged rightly of everything." [...] She also judged Casanova astutely. As noted Casanovist J. Rives Childs wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 29, 2011 Walker {{announced}} that he was considering a return to the NFL.

[...] "I want to be the George Foreman of football, come back and do that one more time... The two teams I would come back to play for are Minnesota or Atlanta. It would probably be Atlanta because that's home for me." [...] According to Walker, his mixed martial arts training made him, [...] "a much better-conditioned athlete now <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was playing football.

2500|$|The {{official}} {{details of}} the eighth album, entitled Damage, emerged in early April 2013 and on April 10, 2013, a lead single titled [...] "I Will Steal You Back" [...] was revealed via the band's website. The title track Damage appears on the 7-inch Damage EP along with a cover version of the Radiohead song [...] "Stop Whispering". The EP was released on April 20, 2013 for Record Store Day, an internationally recognized celebration in support of music and independent retail outlets. Jimmy Eat World also released the album's track-listing, consisting of ten songs, and [...] June 11, 2013 as the official release date. Adkins explained in a Rolling Stone magazine interview that Damage is a “pretty energetic” work that explores the issue of relationship break-ups {{from the perspective of}} an adult: [...] "I’m 37 and the world around me is a lot different <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was writing break-up songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Eat World {{began writing}} Damage in early 2012, with vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins noting: [...] "I think with [...] Invented [...] an outline {{that it would}} be themed around. Not {{necessarily}} a subject, but we had a direction before we wrote it. As you get older it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I would say this album [...] has a theme. I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E
