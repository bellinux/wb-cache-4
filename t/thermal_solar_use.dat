40|$|Many <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> {{power plants}} <b>use</b> <b>thermal</b> oil as heat {{transfer}} fluid, and molten salts as thermal energy storage.

The complexity of these <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> plants is rather high, as they combine traditional engineering used in power stations (water-steam cycle) or petrochemical (oil piping), with the new solar (parabolic trough collector) and heat storage (molten salts) technologies. With the engineering of these plants being relatively new, regulation of the thermal energy storage system is currently achieved in manual or semiautomatic ways, controlling its variables with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulators. This makes the overall performance of these plants non optimal. This work focuses on energy storage systems based on molten salt, and defines a complete model of the process. By defining such a model, the ground for future research into optimal control methods will be established.
