40|$|Wrench {{converts}} gripping {{action of}} hand to rotary motion without imparting reactive moments or forces on part being turned or on operator. Wrench should {{be useful in}} undersea operations and other delicate work where reactive forces and torques have to be controlled. In design for valve tightening, tool resembles cross between conventional spanner wrench and pilers. One handle engages valve body; second handle has ratchet pawl that engages <b>toothed</b> <b>coupling</b> ring on perimeter of valve handle. When operator squeezes wrench handles, valve handle rotates with respect to valve body...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The article {{concerns}} {{dynamics and}} vibration {{of a high}} power rotating system with <b>toothed</b> wheel <b>coupling</b> that inserts elastic plate packets. Theoretical modeling and simulation of the rotating system with <b>toothed</b> wheel <b>coupling</b> have been provided by a finite element method. Complex model involved a rotating system, hydrodynamic bearings and coupling. The dynamics of semi-couplings and plates have been simulated. Experimental measurement of vibration has been measured with stationary machine condition monitoring and a diagnostic system...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{dynamics of}} high power rotating system with <b>toothed</b> wheel <b>coupling.</b> The elastic contacts located between plates and between plateâ€™s packets and semi couplings teeth. Friction between plates inside packet and teeth generates fretting corrosion phenomenon and damages plates. Theoretical {{modeling and simulation}} of rotating system was provided by a finite element method. Complex model involved rotating system, hydrodynamic bearings and coupling. The dynamics of semi couplings and plates have been simulated end experimentally monitored. The experimental testing of rotating system was provided by stationary machine condition monitoring and diagnostic system. High frequency absolute vibration acceleration, however, {{make it possible to}} determine the technical condition of <b>toothed</b> wheel <b>coupling,</b> which is difficult to determine by applying the shafts vibration...|$|R
