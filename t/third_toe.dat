5|$|More recent {{analyses}} {{using different}} sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for Balaur. In 2013, a larger analysis containing {{a wide variety of}} coelurosaurs found that Balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all, but a basal avialan, more closely related to modern birds than to Jeholornithiformes but more basal than Omnivoropterygiformes. A study published in 2014 found Balaur to be sister to Pygostylia. An independent analysis using an expanded version of the original data set (the one that found Balaur to be a dromaeosaurid) drew a similar conclusion in 2014. In 2015, researchers Andrea Cau, Tom Brougham, and Darren Naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of Balaur. While their analysis could not completely {{rule out the possibility that}} B. bondoc was a dromaeosaurid, they concluded that this result was less likely than the classification of Balaur as a non-pygostylian avialan based on several important bird-like features. Many of the presumed unique traits would in fact have been normal for a member of the Avialae. Typical bird features included the degree of fusion of the limb bones, the functional first toe, the first toe claw not being smaller than the second claw, a long penultimate phalanx of the <b>third</b> <b>toe,</b> a small fourth toe claw and a long fifth metatarsal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Oligocene, Mesohippus {{was one of}} the more {{widespread}} mammals in North America. It walked on three toes on each of its front and hind feet (the first and fifth toes remained, but were small and not used in walking). The <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> was stronger than the outer ones, and thus more weighted; the fourth front toe was diminished to a vestigial nub. Judging by its longer and slimmer limbs, Mesohippus was an agile animal.|$|E
25|$|The Miohippus {{population}} that {{remained on the}} steppes {{is believed to be}} ancestral to Parahippus, a North American animal {{about the size of a}} small pony, with a prolonged skull and a facial structure resembling the horses of today. Its <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> was stronger and larger, and carried the main weight of the body. Its four premolars resembled the molar teeth; the first were small and almost nonexistent. The incisor teeth, like those of its predecessors, had a crown (like human incisors); however, the top incisors had a trace of a shallow crease marking the beginning of the core/cup.|$|E

25|$|The holotype, MNHN 1998-13, {{has been}} {{uncovered}} in {{a layer of}} the Calcaire de Caen dating from the middle Bathonian. It consists of a fragmentary skeleton with skull. Preserved parts include: {{the majority of the}} skull; the splenial and angular of the lower jaw, a natural mold of the surangular, two cervical vertebrae, cervical ribs, seven dorsals, ribs, gastralia, three sacrals, ten caudals, a chevron, a piece of the scapula, a claw of the hand, a partial thighbone, the upper part of a shinbone, a partial fibula, a fifth metatarsal and the first phalanx of the <b>third</b> <b>toe.</b> Considering the incompleteness of most other megalosaurids, this genus is exceptional in having a significant percentage of the skeleton been found. The type specimen of Dubreuillosaurus is in the number of preserved elements only rivalled in this group by that of Eustreptospondylus. The holotype represents a subadult individual.|$|E
500|$|The left scapula and fibula of an Allosaurus fragilis {{specimen}} catalogued as USNM 4734 {{are both}} pathological, both {{probably due to}} healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and [...] "formed pseudoarthroses." [...] A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae {{near the end of}} the tail. An apparent subadult male Allosaurus fragilis was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries. The specimen MOR 693 had pathologies on five ribs, the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae, the second tail vertebra and its chevron, the gastralia right scapula, manual phalanx I left ilium metatarsals III and V, the first phalanx of the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> and the third phalanx of the second. The ilium had [...] "a large hole... caused by a blow from above".The near end of the first phalanx of the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> was afflicted by an involucrum.|$|E
500|$|The hallux (the first toe of the foot) {{showed a}} large claw that was {{flattened}} laterally, {{as seen in}} [...] "prosauropods". However, the claws of the second and <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> were unusual in being nail-like and broader than deep. This feature was {{also found in the}} probably closely related Tazoudasaurus, but is absent in all other sauropods. The feet of Vulcanodon were semiplantigrade as in later sauropods (where both the digits and part of the metatarsals contact the ground), a derived feature not found in more basal sauropods like Isanosaurus. However, they also retained primitive features, like the fact that the phalanges were not reduced.|$|E

40|$|Two {{cases of}} ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum in {{siblings}} are presented. One sib had associated cleft lip and palate, {{the other had}} bilateral syndactyly of the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes.</b> Father, paternal grandmother, and great-grandmother all had bilateral syndactyly of the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes.</b> Cases of ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum reported in the ophthalmic literature are reviewed as are cases of ankyloblepharon occurring {{as part of the}} popliteal pterygium syndrome. It is postulated that the association of ankyloblepharon with other abnormalities may be part of the spectrum of the popliteal pterygium syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity...|$|R
5000|$|The even-toed {{ungulates}} (Artiodactyla, [...] ) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the <b>third</b> and fourth <b>toes.</b> By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their <b>third</b> <b>toes.</b> The aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from within {{even-toed ungulates}}, so modern taxonomic classification sometimes combines the Artiodactyla and Cetacea into the Cetartiodactyla.|$|R
500|$|Other pathologies {{reported}} in Allosaurus include: Willow breaks in two ribs. Healed fractures in the humerus and radius. Distortion of joint surfaces {{in the foot}} possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues. Osteopetrosis along the endosteal surface of a tibia. Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to osetoarthritis or developmental issues. [...] "xtensive 'neoplastic' ankylosis of caudals," [...] possibly due to physical trauma {{as well as the}} fusion of chevrons to centra. Coossification of vertebral centra {{near the end of the}} tail. Amputation of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites. [...] "xtensive exostoses" [...] in the first phalanx of the <b>third</b> <b>toe.</b> Lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae. Bone spurs in a premaxilla, ungual, and two metacarpals. Exostosis in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease. A metacarpal with a round depressed fracture.|$|E
500|$|The completeness, preservation, and {{scientific}} {{importance of this}} skeleton gave [...] "Big Al" [...] its name; the individual itself was below the average size for Allosaurus fragilis, and was a subadult estimated at only 87%grown. The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996. Nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of infection, which {{may have contributed to}} [...] "Big Al's" [...] death. Pathologic bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet; several damaged bones showed osteomyelitis, a bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait. Al had an infection on the first phalanx on the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> that was afflicted by an involucrum. The infection was long lived, perhaps up to 6 months. Big Al Two is also known to have multiple injuries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the horse came to walk only {{on the end of}} the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> and both side toes. Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of metacarpal and metatarsal bones, commonly called the [...] "splint bones". They are the remnants of the second and the fourth toe. Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the tarsal joints (hocks).|$|E
40|$|Fifty pedigrees of type I {{syndactyly}} were {{analysed for}} sex ratio and segreation pattern. Thirty-four of the pedigrees {{were from the}} published reports; 16 were collected in the State of Utah. Pedigrees with affected individuals showing webbing between the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes</b> are characterized by a sex ratio of affected individuals favouring males and a highly significant excess of affected sons of heterozygous fathers. A similar distorted segregation pattern is present in those pedigrees when the webbing involves the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes</b> and/or the <b>third</b> and fourth fingers, but not in those pedigrees when the webbing involves other digits. The reason for the distorted segregation pattern is unknown. Hypothesis include abnormal chromosome segregation and gametic selection...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. I {{heard her}} say, 'Look at my right foot--you see there's nothing {{the matter with}} it.' And then, after a while, she said, 'Look at my left foot--look between the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> and the fourth.' Did you ever hear of such a audacious thing for a married woman {{to say to a}} young man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Her {{left foot}} {{was nothing to}} be proud of, I can tell you! By her own account, she has some horrid {{deformity}} in it, between the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> and the fourth. No; I didn't hear her say what the deformity was. I only heard her call it so--and she said her 'poor darling' was born with the same fault, and that was her defence against being imposed upon by rogues--I remember the very words--'in the past days when I employed people to find her.' Yes! she said 'her.' I heard it plainly. And she talked afterwards of her 'poor lost daughter', who might be still living somewhere, and wondering who her mother was. Naturally enough, when I heard that hateful old drunkard talking about a child given to her by Mr. Farnaby, I put two and two together. Dear me, how strangely you look!

60|$|On {{comparing}} the pelvis and hind limb of the ornithoscelidan {{with that of}} the crocodile, on the one side, and that of the bird, on the other (Fig. 6), it is obvious that it represents a middle term between the two. The pelvic bones approach the form of those of the birds, and the direction of the pubis and ischium is nearly that which is characteristic of birds; the thigh bone, from the direction of its head, must have lain close to the body; the tibia has a great crest; and, immovably fitted on to its lower end, there is a pulley-shaped bone, like that of the bird, but remaining distinct. The lower end of the fibula is much more slender, proportionally, than in the crocodile. The metatarsal bones have such a form that they fit together immovably, though they do not enter into bony union; the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> is, as in the bird, longest and strongest. In fact, the ornithoscelidan limb is comparable to that of an unhatched chick.|$|E
50|$|The first toe is {{the large}} one, the {{equivalent}} of a human big toe. However, in all these prosimians the foot is more or less hand-like. The first toe is opposable, like a human thumb, and the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes</b> correspond approximately to the index and middle fingers.|$|R
25|$|The {{foot of a}} {{passerine}} {{has three}} toes directed forward and one toe directed backward, called anisodactyl arrangement. This arrangement enables the passerine birds to perch upon vertical surfaces, such as trees and cliffs. The toes have no webbing or joining, but in some cotingas, the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes</b> are united at their basal <b>third.</b> The hind <b>toe</b> joins the leg {{at the same level}} as the front toes. The passeriformes have this toe arrangement in common with hunting birds like eagles and falcons.|$|R
5000|$|The Ancient Greeks and Romans wore {{versions}} of flip-flops as well. In Greek sandals, the toe strap was worn {{between the first}} and second toes, while Roman sandals had the strap between the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes.</b> These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the <b>third</b> and fourth <b>toes.</b> In India, a related chappal ("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting {{between the first and}} second toes. They are known as Padukas ...|$|R
60|$|Within {{an hour of}} {{the signing}} of the will the {{testator}} was found dead, apparently from the effects of fear, but the niece was not in the room at the time of death. The only other remarkable circumstance in the case was that the disreputable lover of the niece had been seen hanging about the house at dusk, the testator having died at ten o'clock at night. There was also a further fact. The son, on receiving a message from the niece that his father was seriously worse, had hurried with extraordinary speed to the house, passing some one or something--he could not tell what--that seemed to be running, apparently from the window of the sick man's room, which was on the ground floor, and beneath which footmarks were afterwards found. Of these footmarks two casts had been taken, of which photographs were forwarded with the brief. They had been made by naked feet of small size, and in each case the little joint of the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> of the right foot seemed to be missing. But all attempts to find the feet that made them had hitherto failed. The will was contested by the next of kin, for whom Geoffrey was one of the counsel, upon the usual grounds of undue influence and fraud; but as it seemed at present with small prospect of success, for, though the circumstances were superstitious enough, there was not the slightest evidence of either. This curious case, of which the outlines are here written, is briefly set out, because it proved to be the foundation of Geoffrey's enormous practice and reputation at the Bar.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} something," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{do not know}} if it is right. Don't you see, the old man was superstitious; they frightened him first of all by a ghostly voice or some such thing into signing the will, and then to death after he had signed it. The lawyer's clerk {{prepared}} the will--he would know how to do it. Then he was smuggled into the room under the bed, or somewhere, dressed up as a ghost perhaps. The sending for the son by the niece was a blind. The thing that was seen running away was a boy--those footprints were made by a boy. I have seen so many thousands on the sands here that I could swear to it. He was attracted to the house from the road, which was quite near, by catching sight of something unusual through the blind; the brief says there were no curtains or shutters. Now look at the photographs of the footprints. See in No. 1, found outside the window, the toes are pressed down deeply into the mud. The owner of the feet was standing on tip-toe to get a better view. But in No. 2, which was found near where the son thought he saw a person running, the toes are spread out quite wide. That is the footprint of some one who was in a great hurry. Now it is not probable that a boy {{had anything to do with}} the testator's death. Why, then, was the boy running so hard? I will tell you: because he was frightened at something he had seen through the blind. So frightened was he, that he will not come forward, or answer the advertisements and inquiries. Find a boy in that town who has a joint missing on the <b>third</b> <b>toe</b> of the right foot, and you will soon know all about it." ...|$|E
60|$|It grew so {{hot that}} it was almost {{impossible}} to sleep at night. The heat seemed to linger under the trees {{as though it were a}} material thing. They did not wish to leave the starlit night, and the three of them would sit on the terrace of Ruth Chalice's room, silent, hour after hour, too tired to talk any more, but in voluptuous enjoyment of the stillness. They listened to the murmur of the river. The church clock struck one and two and sometimes three before they could drag themselves to bed. Suddenly Philip became aware that Ruth Chalice and Lawson were lovers. He divined it in the way the girl looked at the young painter, and in his air of possession; and as Philip sat with them he felt a kind of effluence surrounding them, as though the air were heavy with something strange. The revelation was a shock. He had looked upon Miss Chalice as a very good fellow and he liked to talk to her, but it had never seemed to him possible to enter into a closer relationship. One Sunday they had all gone with a tea-basket into the forest, and when they came to a glade which was suitably sylvan, Miss Chalice, because it was idyllic, insisted on taking off her shoes and stockings. It would have been very charming only her feet were rather large and she had on both a large corn on the <b>third</b> <b>toe.</b> Philip felt it made her proceeding a little ridiculous. But now he looked upon her quite differently; there was something softly feminine in her large eyes and her olive skin; he felt himself a fool not to have seen that she was attractive. He thought he detected in her a touch of contempt for him, because he had not had the sense to see that she was there, in his way, and in Lawson a suspicion of superiority. He was envious of Lawson, and he was jealous, not of the individual concerned, but of his love. He wished that he was standing in his shoes and feeling with his heart. He was troubled, and the fear seized him that love would pass him by. He wanted a passion to seize him, he wanted to be swept off his feet and borne powerless in a mighty rush he cared not whither. Miss Chalice and Lawson seemed to him now somehow different, and the constant companionship with them made him restless. He was dissatisfied with himself. Life was not giving him what he wanted, and he had an uneasy feeling that he was losing his time.|$|E
50|$|They have arched front claws {{that are}} pointed acutely {{for the purpose}} of climbing. The first two digits on these foreclaws are opposable to the other three digits.

40|$|SUMMARY Fifty pedigrees of type I {{syndactyly}} were {{analysed for}} sex ratio and segregation pattern. Thirty-four of the pedigrees {{were from the}} published reports; 16 were collected in the State of Utah. Pedigrees with affected individuals showing webbing between the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes</b> are character-ized by a sex ratio of affected individuals favouring males and a highly significant excess of affected sons of heterozygous fathers. A similar distorted segregation pattern is present in those pedigrees when the webbing involves the second and <b>third</b> <b>toes</b> and/or the <b>third</b> and fourth fingers, but not in those pedigrees when the webbing involves other digits. The reason for the distorted segregation pattern is unknown. Hypotheses include abnormal chromosome segregation and gametic selection. Because of its usually conspicuous nature and fre-quently dominant mode of inheritance, the malforma-tion, syndactyly, is a prime subject for family history studies. Pedigree and case studies of it are widespread in scientific and medical journals. The available in-formation shows that syndactyly is characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity.
