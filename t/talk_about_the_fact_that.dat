That's why I like to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> sometimes I am attracted to women. I appreciate their femininity and beauty."

For example, one mentor, who came from a dyad where both she and her student were women from underrepresented ethnic groups, explained, “By pointing out my own shortcomings and things that I continue to struggle with, she [the student] has been able to make adjustments in her own actions and learn to take constructive criticism rather than just becoming reactionary.” Other mentors emphasized a mutual approach to solving difficulty. For instance, in a dyad in which both parties were from underrepresented ethnic groups, the male mentor noted of his female student, “When difficult moments arise, we deal with them as if we were family, because we are a family.” It was also fairly routine for mentors to normalize difficulty as common to the practice of science, such as one male mentor from an overrepresented ethnic group, discussing his female student who was from an underrepresented ethnic group.

40|$|AbstractIn {{many parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} starting from 1980 a set of transformations is being experienced in the field of education. With these transformations while the meaning and content of the education changes, the teachers who are the most basic actors of education field are expected to keep pace with this change process and to be even active agents of this process. Therefore, it is possible to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> some significant changes in education, employment and working conditions of teachers have been taking place in recent times. The discussions in literature in regards to efforts to understand and explain the change and transformations experienced in the profession of teaching are usually based on two main approaches. While in the first approach it is claimed that teachers are being “professionalized” over time, in the latter approach it is claimed that teachers are not professionals no longer, on the contrary, with the transformation process they are increasingly getting deskilled and hence are being “proletarianized”. The aim {{of this study is that}} within the axis of profession of teaching and by focusing on theoretical discussions regarding “professionalization” and “proletarianization”, to establish a theoretical framework to understand the changes experienced in teachers’ work...|$|E

40|$|WikiLeaks and the Age of Transparency, as {{the title}} suggests, is about the {{emergence}} of the internet as a means of achieving more open government. The book discusses the utilisation of websites and social media by political movements - from the American 'TEA Party' through to the Obama Campaign and, of course, the ongoing WikiLeaks 'incident' (where highly sensitive US security and embassy documents have been published to the world). The author, Micah Sifry, comes from a public accountability background and openly declares his bias that he regards the internet as something which can both open governments (hence making them more accountable) and lead to collaborative government (in which politicians use social media to become more responsive to their citizens' needs and demands). Only occasionally does Sifry <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> instantaneous communication can lead to the rash publication of inaccurate (or needless/irrelevant) data and that the organisational capacity of social media can lead to the insidious bullying of others (and sometimes mistaken sullying of reputations). This, in my view, is the weakness of the book – it is a bit one-sided. As this present reviewer has published in her academic work, freedom of information and mass organisational capabilities can lead to tremendous social good, but they can also lead to painful errors and allow small groups to occasionally hijack the political agenda. In the reviewer's opinion, the power the internet gives to people should be coupled with consideration of responsibilities. That aside, the book does deal with something clearly here to stay – the internet as a political tool. And, as Sifry acknowledges, the final form of the internet in its political dimension is as yet unknown. To that end, the book makes a contribution to the literature on an important subject...|$|E
