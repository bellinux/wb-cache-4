5|$|A new {{paper on}} the cranio-dental {{morphology}} of Allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off {{to allow for the}} widened gape.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> low price of $15,000, with the understanding that the railroads would build a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E

5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. <b>The</b> <b>unusually</b> low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E
5|$|Empress Maria Theresia of Austria {{reformed}} {{the measures}} and weights of the Habsburg monarchy in 1761. The weight of an apothecaries' pound of 12 ounces was increased to a value {{that was later}} (after the kilogramme was defined) found to be 420.009g; this was called the libra medicinalis major. It was defined as 3/4 of <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> heavy Habsburg civil pound (defined as 6/5 of the civil pound of Cologne) and corresponded to a record ounce weight of 35g.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is found}} in meteorites in much higher {{abundance}} than in the Earth's crust. For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary {{gave rise to the}} Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66million years ago. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second season}} aired in Canada under <b>the</b> title <b>Unusually</b> Thicke: Under Construction, and centred on Thicke {{and his family}} doing a {{renovation}} project on their home. In Canada, Under Construction aired on HGTV in 2015, although in the United States it aired on Pop under <b>the</b> original <b>Unusually</b> Thicke title beginning in September 2016.|$|R
50|$|The A-10 did not {{originally}} have a route number. Instead, route marker signs {{featured a}} red triangular shield featuring {{the name of}} <b>the</b> route. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>the</b> directional signs were also originally red. Later, blue shields and signs replaced the red versions.|$|R
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{dimensions}} of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a wider and therefore more advantageous diet. There is an allometric scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis from which an interesting adaptive departure is <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> long-tongued sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta. Charles Darwin predicted the existence and proboscis length of this moth before its discovery based on {{his knowledge of the}} long-spurred Madagascan star orchid Angraecum sesquipedale.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{affected}} {{the town of}} Norfolk, where it became the most damaging storm since 1879. Despite the damage inland, the storm {{is best known for}} <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> high number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused. One ship, a schooner called the Manantico, capsized, killing the captain and one of its crew members. Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry, and numerous others were put in danger.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unusually</b> heavy smog {{was evident}} {{to the crowd}} of one million onlookers at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Tabloids and {{newspapers}} that ordinarily ran front-page stories about the parade instead carried stories about the smog. Health officials cautioned those with chronic lung diseases to stay indoors and advised patients that symptoms of pollution-related illness usually lagged 24 hours after exposure.|$|E

50|$|At the 1912 Olympia Motor Cycle and Cycle Car show Matchless {{showed a}} V-twin powered cycle car, with two wheels {{at the front}} and a single drive wheel at <b>the</b> rear. <b>Unusually</b> <b>the</b> drive was by shaft and bevel gear. The frame was of pressed steel channel. It was priced at 100 guineas.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unusually</b> low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unusually</b> {{warm and}} sunny weather {{conditions}} were credited with helping the 2011 meeting set a Grand National attendance record. A crowd of 70,291 people attended the main Saturday race day, {{and a total}} of 153,583 attended {{over the course of the}} three-day meeting, beating the previous record of 151,660 set in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Wright is {{currently}} rated {{as one of}} the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture. Perhaps due to <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.|$|E
50|$|Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd 1925 AC 619 {{appeared}} before the House Of Lords concerning the principle of lifting <b>the</b> corporate veil. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>the</b> request to do so was in this case made by the corporation's owner.|$|R
50|$|Dark Avengers is an American {{comic book}} series {{published}} by Marvel Comics. It {{is part of}} a series of titles that have featured various iterations of the superhero team <b>the</b> Avengers. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>the</b> series stars a version of the team that, unknown to the public in its fictional universe, contains several members who are supervillains disguised as established superheroes.|$|R
50|$|The G-20 was a {{monoplane}} with a {{low wing}} of semi-elliptical plan, its greatest chord some way out from <b>the</b> roots. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>the</b> wing was braced from above {{with a pair of}} inverted V steel struts to a crash pylon within the enclosed forward cockpit. The wing had long, broad chord ailerons and manually operated flaps.|$|R
5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes {{well away from the}} Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 cracks were {{noticed in}} the rock which {{is made up of}} mudstones and {{sandstones}} of the Porthtowan Formation and slates/siltstones of the Mylor Slate Formation from the Devonian. The route of the path was diverted as the cracks enlarged. On 23 September approximately [...] of rock fell into <b>the</b> sea. <b>Unusually</b> <b>the</b> rockfall was captured on video.|$|R

5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced shaking at Pangandaran (where the M6.3 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake {{was felt}} more strongly) of intensity III–IV (Weak–Light), intensity III at Cianjur, and II (Weak) at Yogyakarta. Further inland and {{farther from the}} epicenter, intensity IV shaking made tall buildings sway in Jakarta, but at some coastal villages {{where many of the}} casualties occurred, the shaking was not felt as strong. An informal survey of 67 people that were present at the time revealed that in at least eight cases, individuals stated that they did not feel the earthquake at all (a typical M7.7 earthquake would have been distinctly noticed at those distances). <b>The</b> <b>unusually</b> low felt intensities, along with the short period body wave magnitudes, were components of the event that narrowed its classification into that of a tsunami earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The staircase has nine unusually high steps— high, about {{twice as high as}} the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that <b>the</b> <b>unusually</b> high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the both sides of the staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unusually</b> high {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
50|$|By the 14th {{century the}} monastery had entered a decline, and in 1373 was {{granted to the}} Carthusians of Pisa Charterhouse by Pope Gregory XI, under the {{influence}} of Saint Catherine of Siena. The Benedictines were banned from <b>the</b> island. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>the</b> prior of the new charterhouse inherited from his Benedictine predecessors the title of abbot, and the charterhouse that of abbey.|$|R
50|$|Gmina Grunwald {{is divided}} into 19 sołectwos. The villages with the largest {{population}} are Gierzwałd, which {{dates back to the}} 14th century, and Zybułtowo. Gierzwałd is the administrative seat of <b>the</b> gmina. <b>Unusually</b> <b>the</b> gmina is not named after the seat, but takes its name from the smaller village of Grunwald, because of the historical importance of the Battle of Grunwald of 1410.|$|R
50|$|Tikal Group O (also {{known as}} Group 4D-1) {{is on the}} west side of the Maler Causeway, due west from the twin-pyramid groups Q and R. It differs in size from the twin-pyramid groups to <b>the</b> east. <b>Unusually,</b> <b>the</b> stela-altar pair in the {{northern}} enclosure are plain monuments, lacking sculpture and hieroglyphic text. This group is likely to have been dedicated in 731.|$|R
