5|$|Guard {{units were}} {{generally}} neglected when the United States Air Force was created. Despite {{the introduction of}} jet fighters, the Guard units were left with generally overused World War II propeller aircraft, and had few funds for training. As the Cold War intensified, the Air Force looked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> to fill United States-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization. Although the Massachusetts Air National Guard wasn't federalized for the Korean War, many airmen volunteered for active duty and flew in Korea. On 1 November 1950, the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102d Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st squadrons and their associated support units, {{and at some point}} before 1961 the wing was renamed a Tactical Fighter Wing. Additionally, the wing kept the 567th, and the 1801st. The squadrons were issued F-84B Thunderjets, but these were recalled and replaced by F-51 Mustangs which were flown until 1954 when the F-94 Starfire replaced the Mustangs. In 1952 the 253rd Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102d. In 1958 the Wing converted to the F-86H Sabre.|$|E
25|$|He began {{preparing}} {{himself for}} the confrontation with the Iron Guard.

25|$|He {{was educated}} at the Imperial Austrian Academy of Engineers from 1849 to 1853 {{and joined the}} Imperial Austrian Army as a {{lieutenant}} in the 1st Lancers in 1854.

He served as Orderly Officer under Count von Wimpffen in Italy during the Austro-Sardinian War and was awarded the gold medal for distinguished service at the Battle of Solferino and the bronze war medal, 1859.|$|E
25|$|For the {{execution}} of his project the Napoleon initiated an attack by the Imperial Guard, with Milhaud's Corps of Cuirassiers in support. He wished to conceal this movement {{as much as possible}} from the Prussians, and caused it to be made to the right, along the rear of the IV Corps (Gérard's), a portion of whose batteries were ordered to be withdrawn, for the purpose of affording greater protection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard,</b> by diverting the Prussians's fire to other points, and of deceiving them as to the real object of the movement, if observed previously to the actual execution of Napoleon's design.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, at {{the very}} start of 1941, Maria Antonescu joined the board of Regina Elisabeta Society, a welfare {{organization}} chaired by Queen Helen. She also took over a new state-run charity, Sprijinul ("The Support"), which reputedly made her a contender in the conflict opposing her husband <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard,</b> before the Legionary Rebellion of early 1941 brought the Guard's downfall. According to Spanish historian Francisco Veiga, her humanitarian effort was endorsed by the more conservative pro-Antonescu factions in reaction to Guardist projects such as Ajutorul Legionar. Sprijinul ensured participation from Veturia Goga. They were also joined by the wife of World War I hero, General Constantin Prezan, and by Sanda Manuilă.|$|E

25|$|The end of Bank Line's SA-15 class ships was {{not without}} incident. On 28 April 2009, on her last {{complete}} voyage in round-the-world service, Boularibank was attacked by Somalian pirates 120 miles northeast of Socotra Island {{at the entrance to}} the Gulf of Aden. Unable to outrun the attackers, Captain Peter Stapleton carried out evasive manoeuvres while under fire from the assailants' AK-47s and RPGs and had his crew ward off the invaders using water cannons, twistlocks and heavy balks of timber lashed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> rails. By the time a destroyer of the Russian Navy arrived at the scene the pirates had given up, leaving Boularibanks crew of 31, eleven passengers and the captain's wife unharmed. Stapleton was later awarded the Merchant Navy Medal for exceptional bravery during the attack.|$|E
25|$|With the {{formation}} of the US Air Force the Guard units suffered from neglect. In the midst of the switch to jet fighters, the Guard units were left with their handed-down and generally overused World War II propeller aircraft, and had little money for training. As the Cold War intensified, the Air Forced looked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> to fill US-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization. On 1 November 1950 the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102nd Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st along with their associated support units. The squadrons were issued F-84B Thunderjets, but these aircraft were recalled and replaced by F-51 Mustangs which were flown until 1954 when the F-94 Starfire replaced the Twin Mustangs.

25|$|The blade {{itself is}} customarily {{divided into three}} {{sections}} for leverage in different offensive and defensive techniques. The tip of the blade is the jiànfeng, meant for stabbing, slashing, and quick percussive cuts. The jiànfeng typically curves smoothly to a point, though in the Ming period sharply angled points were common. Some antiques have rounded points, though these are likely the result of wear. The middle section is the zhongren or middle edge, and is used {{for a variety of}} offensive and defensive actions: cleaving cuts, draw cuts, and deflections. The section of blade closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> is called the jiàngen or root, and is mainly used for defensive actions; on some late period jian, the base of the blade was made into an unsharpened ricasso. These sections are not necessarily of the same length, with the jiànfeng being only three or four inches long.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{inspection}} of the new guard, the old guard is inspected. After this inspection, the sergeants of the guard and division seconds-in-command are ordered to 'take post' – the sergeant of the guard marches from the right flank to directly behind the guard, while the second-in-command marches from the left flank to the right. The parade is then called to the present arms for the marching on of the regimental colours. With the colours marched on, the new guard advances at the slow march, ceremonially 'taking up the ground' from the old guard. The old guard and new guard salute each other at present arms. Following this, the old guard commander presents the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> Room at Rideau Hall to the new guard commander. The parade is then formed into three ranks and marched off at the slow march, transitioning into the quick march. The order of march differs only in that the old guard {{is now at the}} rear.|$|E
25|$|Born {{the only}} son of General the Hon. William Maitland (himself the fourth son of James Maitland, 7th Earl of Lauderdale) and Mary Maitland (née Orpen), Maitland joined the navy on 22 September 1816. Promoted to {{lieutenant}} on 16 May 1823, {{he was appointed}} to the frigate HMS Euryalus in the Mediterranean Fleet. In HMS Euryalus he saw action supporting the blockade of Algiers by Greek revolutionaries in July 1824 during the Greek War of Independence. He transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> ship HMS Superb at Portsmouth in December 1825 and to the second-rate HMS Ganges, flagship of Admiral Sir Robert Otway serving as Commander-in-Chief of the South America Station, in March 1826. Promoted to commander on 30 April 1827, he saw action again when HMS Ganges took part in an operation to land a naval brigade in Brazil to protect Pedro I, the Emperor of Brazil, {{in the face of the}} Irish and German Mercenary Soldiers' Revolt in June 1828. He returned home when HMS Ganges became the guard ship at Portsmouth in 1829.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu {{felt he had}} {{to amend}} the purpose of the {{movement}} after more than two years of stagnation: he and the leadership of the movement started touring rural regions, addressing the churchgoing illiterate population with the rhetoric of sermons, dressing up in long white mantles and instigating Christian prejudice against Judaism (this intense campaign was also prompted {{by the fact that the}} Legion was immediately sidelined by Cuza's League in the traditional Moldavian and Bukovinan centers). Between 1928 and 1930, the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod National Peasants' Party cabinet gave tacit assistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guard,</b> but Iuliu Maniu (representing the same party) clamped down on the Legion after July 1930. This came after the latter had tried to provoke a wave of pogroms in Maramureș and Bessarabia. In one notable incident of 1930, Legionaries encouraged the peasant population of Borșa to attack the town's 4,000 Jews. The Legion had also attempted to assassinate government officials and journalists — including Constantin Angelescu, undersecretary of Internal Affairs. Codreanu was briefly arrested together with the would-be assassin Gheorghe Beza: both were tried and acquitted. Nevertheless, the wave of violence and a planned march into Bessarabia signalled the outlawing of the party by Premier Gheorghe Mironescu and Minister of the Interior Ion Mihalache (January 1931); again arrested, Codreanu was acquitted in late February.|$|E

25|$|The {{first floor}} {{is where the}} Great Hall with its large vaulted ceiling is situated. The Great Hall was mainly used for grand banquets and {{entertainment}} for the lord and his guests. Guests staying at the castle would have also slept {{on the floor of}} the Great Hall. The Hall also served as a court as the lord would act as a judge passing verdicts and sentences for crimes committed in the surrounding area. The first floor also has a minstrel's gallery where a group of travelling minstrels would play instruments and act for the Lord and Lady sitting below. Off the minstrel's gallery is the minstrels changing room, where the travelling players would change into their bright costumes. This room would also have been used by the minstrels to sleep in; the reason for them having their own private quarters was that it was feared that many of them would have been carrying disease. They slept here to stop them passing any ailments on to other guests. The guard room also sits on the first floor. The guard room has the only access to the dungeon in the castle, a small hole in the floor where prisoners were thrown in. A guard would always be present in this room to both guard the dungeon but also the only entrance to the castle, a small door above ground level, which is next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> room.|$|E
