However, Veronica recognizes them as being the same ones Ben was loading into his car earlier. Veronica calls Pete, and she tells him that she knows he falsely implicated Norris (with the help of <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> agent) because of terrible bullying in junior high. Meg tells Veronica that Duncan has disappeared after removing $10,000 from the bank. The story involving Norris is published in the newspaper, and, although it leads to all charges against Norris being dropped, it also results in the new journalism teacher's (Joey Lauren Adams) termination.|$|E
5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} and {{validation of the}} prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as the winner of <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E

5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed {{in the rear}} of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured with red and red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 is identical to the SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|The SS192 was {{discontinued}} in late 2004. It used a 1.8g (28grain) {{hollow point}} bullet with a copper jacket and an aluminum core. The projectile had {{a length of}} 21.6mm (.85in). It had an unmarked hollow nose with a depth of 7.6mm (0.3in) and a 0.8-mm (0.03in) opening. The SS192 was classified by <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven.|$|E

5|$|The SS195LF is {{a commercially}} {{available}} cartridge {{that features a}} lead-free primer and produces ballistics similar to the SS192 round, which it replaced in late 2004. It uses the same 1.8-g (28grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet as the SS192, {{and it can be}} identified by the unmarked, hollow void at the tip and the silver-colored primer. The SS195 is classified by <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> as not armor-piercing, and it is currently manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when fired from the Five-seven. The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max bullet acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when fired from the Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by its red polymer tip.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, {{but less}} agile than its competitor. After a {{four-year}} development and evaluation process, the YF-22 was announced {{the winner in}} 1991 and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The U.S. Navy considered using the production version of <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> {{as the basis for}} a replacement to the F-14, but these plans were later canceled. The two YF-23 prototypes were museum exhibits as of 2010.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as the winner of <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it {{to the role of}} an antenna test vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E

The YF-23 design was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile. It was speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but the US Navy abandoned NATF by 1992. Instead of being retired, as with the case of PAV-1, PAV-2 subsequently flew sorties following the competition – it amassed another 61.6 flying hours during 39 flights. On 25April1992, the aircraft sustained serious damage during a landing attempt {{as a result of}} pilot-induced oscillations. It was repaired but never flew again, and instead served as a static test vehicle thereafter. In 1991, it was anticipated that 650 production F-22s would be procured.|$|E
5|$|The SS190 FMJ, a {{refinement}} of the SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol, also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel penetrator and an aluminum core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, and a black-on-white tip color. It is classified by <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> as armor-piercing (AP) handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects editor Marc Varisco, who had {{previously}} collaborated with director Scott on the 2005 film Domino, worked again with Scott to develop Déjà Vu into a fully-fledged work. In total, approximately 400 visual effects scenes were shot during the production of Déjà Vu. They had acquired a LIDAR device, which incorporated lasers to scatter light {{with the intent of}} mapping out a small region, during the production of Domino; Scott and Varisco decided to use the apparatus again during the production of Déjà Vu. Additionally, the two utilized the Panavision Genesis high definition camera to film the shots that would encompass the past that the Snow White team would peer at throughout the film, as well as the various night scenes. The LIDAR apparatus, which was operated by a hired Texan company devoted to the device, performed scans of Claire Kuchever's apartment, the ferry, <b>the</b> <b>ATF</b> office, and actress Paula Patton, among others. Effects editor Zachary Tucker combined the elements created by the Texan LIDAR company with computer-generated graphics to make possible the scenes of time-travel experienced in the film.|$|E
