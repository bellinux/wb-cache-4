40|$|International audienceWe report herein the {{synthesis}} and {{in vitro assay}} of new, multimeric RGD-peptide conjugates for cell-targeted drug delivery. We generated a peptide scaffold comprising two functional domains, one a <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> "homing" motif {{and the other a}} programmed cell-death-inducing peptide sequence. RGD peptides were selected to direct the molecular conjugate to alpha(V) beta(3) integrin-containing tumour cells. The pro-apoptotic (Lys-Leu-Ala-Lys-Leu-Ala-Lys) (2) peptide was found to be nontoxic outside cells, but toxic when internalized into targeted cells as it disrupted the mitochondrial membrane. The synthesis of these targeted pro-apoptotic conjugates was carried out by assembling three different units (that is, scaffold, RGD units and pro-apoptotic peptide) through chemoselective ligations.

The mode of action of the drug appeared to be {{on the development of the}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of the primary tumour. Studies were carried out to demonstrate the nature of the changes occurring in the structure and function of <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> brought about by treatment with ICRF 159. X-ray angiography, carbon black (Pelikan ink) labelling and intravital staining with lissamine green have demonstrated that many of the characteristics of <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were absent In tumours treated with ICRF 159. Further, the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of treated <b>tumours</b> were relatively normal in structure and arrangement. Any alteration of the morphology of <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> may affect the rate of blood flow through the tumour. As this could be critical for most therapeutic modalities, the rate of blood flow through 3 LL tumours treated with ICRF 159 was measured but was found not to be significantly different from control values. It has been reported that <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> are abnormally sensitive to serotonin at doses which have little effect on the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of normal tissue.

40|$|The tumour {{interstitium}} {{represents a}} major barrier to drug delivery and {{modification of the}} tumour extracellular matrix (ECM) is one strategy that could promote better delivery. We have focused upon three factors in the tumour interstitium that could influence drug uptake into the tumour tissue; the interstitial fluid pressure (Pif), collagen content and the <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density (TBVD).

40|$|Angiogenesis {{is crucial}} for {{maintaining}} the supply of oxygen and nutrients required to support solid tumour growth. Inhibitors of <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> formation are therefore being sought, in particular, inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) -signalling, which has {{a pivotal role in}} stimulating neovascular growth and survival. ZD 6474 is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of VEGF receptor- 2 tyrosine kinase activity that in preclinical studies has been shown to inhibit both VEGF-induced signalling in endothelial cells and tumour-induced angiogenesis. Consistent with inhibition of angiogenesis, once-daily oral dosing of ZD 6474 produced significant broad-spectrum antitumour activity in a panel of histologically diverse human tumour xenografts. In addition to its antiangiogenic properties, ZD 6474 also has activity against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which could impart a direct inhibitory effect on tumour cell growth and survival. This may be particularly relevant in tumours with a dependency upon EGFR signalling, for example in certain tumours harbouring activating mutations in EGFR. RET kinase has also been identified as a third target for ZD 6474. This review summarises preclinical studies with this unique agent and considers its future direction in cancer treatment...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 10203 This thesis {{involves}} {{the design and}} synthesis of tubulin binding agents, which aside from their anti-proliferative impact, seek to induce anti-vascular and anti-angiogenic responses on the unique vasculature derived by a growing tumour mass. Once synthesised, studies were conducted on the incorporation {{of the most active}} tubulin binding agents into a novel series of hybrid drugs or designed multiple ligands, which serve to complement their therapeutic effect. The thesis is introduced by a comprehensive overview of the process of angiogenesis, the tumour vasculature network, and the myriad of differences between tumour blood vessels and those of normal vascular systems. Also discussed are the two main interrelated strategies for disrupting the microvasculature of tumours; the anti-angiogenic and anti-vascular approaches, with examples provided for each. The benefit of combination and hybrid therapies is outlined, with particular regard to each side of the concepts we intended to implement; dual targeting of both the tubulin subunits which can eventually cause occlusion of a <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> and the multifunctional enzymatic receptor Aminopeptidase N (APN), expressed solely on tumour vasculature undergoing angiogenesis but not on normal, quiescent vasculature.

40|$|A {{pre-requisite}} for tumour {{growth and}} metastasis is angiogenesis, the sprouting {{and growth of}} new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels. Tumours without the ability to induce the growth of new capillaries remain small, {{in the order of}} 1 - 2 mm 3. Drugs are now available, such as Bevacizumab, to inhibit angiogenesis and human tumour growth. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very aggressive human cancer, has clear angiogenic characteristics and patients with HCC have a very poor clinical outlook. In this context, we review the mechanisms of the predominant angiogenic pathways and how their targeting can impact on liver tumour growth. We also discuss the role of hepatitis in influencing liver <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> growth. Equally, the role of the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is considered, since it is now one of most common causes of liver disease in Western Societies.

40|$|Gliomas {{are highly}} {{invasive}} brain tumours characterised by poor prognosis and limited response to therapy. There {{is an ongoing}} debate on the therapeutic potential of vaso-modulatory interventions against glioma invasion. Prominent vasculature-targeting therapies involve <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> deterioration and normalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation induced by blood vessel occlusion/collapse. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the abnormal tumour vasculature {{is to improve the}} efficacy of conventional treatment modalities. Although these strategies have shown therapeutic potential, it remains unclear why they both often fail to control glioma growth. To shed some light on this issue, we propose a mathematical model based on the migration/proliferation dichotomy of glioma cells in order to investigate why vaso-modulatory interventions have shown limited success in terms of tumour clearance. We found the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that separates glioma responses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two distinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular modulations reduce the front speed and increase the infiltration width, for those in the other regime, the invasion speed increases and infiltration width decreases. We discuss how these in silico findings can be used to guide individualised vaso-modulatory approaches to improve treatment success rates...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To reinvestigate ultra-high {{dose rate}} {{radiation}} (UHDRR) radiobiology and consider potential implications for hadrontherapy. METHODS: A literature search of cellular UHDRR exposures was performed. Standard oxygen diffusion equations {{were used to}} estimate the time taken to replace UHDRR-related oxygen depletion. Dose rates from conventional and novel methods of hadrontherapy accelerators were considered, including spot scanning beam delivery, which intensifies dose rate. RESULTS: The literature findings were that, for X-ray and electron dose rates of around 10 (9) Gy s(- 1), 5 - 10 Gy depletes cellular oxygen, significantly changing the radiosensitivity of cells already in low oxygen tension (around 3 mmHg or 0. 4 kPa). The time taken to reverse the oxygen depletion of such cells {{is estimated to be}} over 20 - 30 s at distances of over 100 μm from a <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> In this time window, tumours have a higher hypoxic fraction (capable of reducing tumour control), so the next application of radiation within the same fraction should be at a time that exceeds these estimates in the case of scanned beams or with ultra-fast laser-generated particles. CONCLUSION: This study has potential implications for particle therapy, including laser-generated particles, where dose rate is greatly increased. Conventional accelerators probably do not achieve the critical UHDRR conditions. However, specific UHDRR oxygen depletion experiments using proton and ion beams are indicated...|$|E

Using the standard equations for the oxygen enhancement ratio for cell survival probability under differing oxygen tensions, we calculate average radiation effect over a range of different vessel densities and organisations. We go on to quantify the vessel distribution heterogeneity and measure spatial organization using Ripley’s L function, a measure designed to detect deviations from complete spatial randomness. We find that under differing regimes of vessel density the correlation coefficient between the measure of spatial organization and radiation effect changes sign. This provides not only a useful way to understand the differences seen in radiation effect for tissues based on vessel architecture, but also an alternate explanation for the vessel normalization hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY: Tumour {{angiogenesis}} and invasion are {{key features}} of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Angiogenesis inhibitors increase progression-free survival (PFS) of recurrent GBM patients. VEGF inhibition controls the bulk tumour growth by inhibition of angiogenesis, {{but does not}} inhibit the invasive tumour component. We investigated if invasive tumour growth can be controlled by combining anti-VEGF treatment with irradiation of tumour plus surrounding brain in an orthotopic murine model for GBM. METHODS AND MATERIALS: GBM cell line U 251 -NG 2 was inoculated through a guide screw in the right frontal lobe of 53 athymic nude mice. Pegaptanib (a slow-releasing aptamer against VEGF) was injected in the tumour bed either or not followed by irradiation treatment with implanted I- 125 seeds. Pegaptanib and/or irradiation were compared with sham-treated controls, resulting in four groups of 10 - 15 mice each. After 6 weeks of treatment, histological analysis was performed on all brains. RESULTS: VEGF inhibition by locally deposited pegaptanib decreased <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density, and increased tumour hypoxia. Pegaptanib treatment still allowed the formation of tumour satellites. Irradiation decreased tumour size and suppressed formation of satellites. Combined pegaptanib plus irradiation further increased PFS. Tumour size directly correlated with PFS.

We developed a novel tumour-mimicking model consisting of a gel matrix containing human breast cancer cells traversed by a fluid channel simulating a <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> through which the virus and microbubbles {{could be made to}} flow. Ultrasonic pressures were chosen to maximize either broadband emissions, associated with inertial cavitation, or ultraharmonic emissions, associated with stable cavitation, while varying duty cycle to keep the total acoustic energy delivered constant for comparison across exposures. None of the exposure conditions tested affected cell viability {{in the absence of the}} adenovirus. When AdEHE 2 F-Luc was delivered via the vessel, inertial cavitation increased transgene expression in tumour cells by up to 200 times. This increase was not observed in the absence of Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor cell expression, discounting sonoporation as the mechanism of action. In the presence of inertial cavitation, AdEHE 2 F-Luc distribution was greatly improved in the matrix surrounding the vessel, particularly in the direction of the ultrasound beam; this enabled AdEHE 2 F-Luc to kill up to 80 % of cancer cells within the ultrasound focal volume in the gel 24 hours after delivery, compared to 0 % in the absence of cavitation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Colon {{cancer is}} the fourth {{most common cause of}} cancer death in the world. It kills {{approximately}} 529, 000 people annually and around two thirds of these deaths are in the developed world. These figures {{can be attributed to the}} fact that colorectal cancers are well advanced before they are detected. Effective prevention of the disease is early detection and removal of pre-cancerous polyps. In cases where cancer has already developed, early detection still significantly improves the chances of cure by surgically removing the cancer before the disease is able to metastasise. However, in metastatic colorectal cancers, in order to ascertain an effective treatment regimen and determine the prognosis of a patient after surgery a prognostic tool that accurately portrays the extent of the disease needs to be developed. Currently, the most commonly used prognostic tool to assess colorectal cancer spread is the clinicopathological staging system. However, there is a need for additional markers of metastasis as nearly one-third of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Dukes' B, a commonly used pathological staging system for colorectal cancer prognosis, will die of the disease despite complete resection of the primary tumour. In several human cancers such as breast, prostate and the lung, tumour vascularity has been shown to be of prognostic value. However, studies correlating the significance of the number of tumour vessels to prognosis in colorectal cancers are relatively lacking or show conflicting results. Moreover, it is not yet fully understood if factors involved in the complicated cascade of <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> formation (tumour angiogenesis), such as proteases cathepsin B and dipeptidyl peptidase IV aid colorectal cancer progression. Two of the most potent angiogenic growth factors: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) playa significant role in the development of tumour vessels; however, their influence on the production of these proteases is not clear. Therefore, this study set out to i) establish a reliable method to quantify colorectal tumour vessels ii) to assess the correlation between vessel counts and prognostic parameters associated with metastasis iii) to ascertain the pattern of spatial distribution of tumour vessels in order to defme the relationship between the positions of the vessels in relation to areas of tumour growth iv) investigate the levels of the enzyme expression of tumour associated proteases cathepsin B and dipeptidyl peptidase IV, at both protein and mRNA level, in colorectal tumours of varying clinicopathological grades and to v) assess the influence of VEGF and bFGF on CB and DPPIV proteolytic enzyme activity in human colon, rectal cancer cells and normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The study established that an effective method to examine tumour vascularity, was by immunolocalising tumour endothelial cells by CD 31 and quantifying all of stained vessels present within each cross-sectional area. As a result of tumour endothelial cell marker assessment it was noted that CD 34 was highly specific to certain vessels and distinctly immunonegative to others and that the same vessels were positive to CD 31. These vessels were morphologically assessed by using the standard histological criteria identified as lymph vessels. Tumour blood and lymph vessels were quantified and a positive correlation to prognostic parameters relating to cancer spread was identified. The pattern of distribution of colorectal tumour vessels was also examined and a distinct pattern was observed in metastatic tumours with greater numbers of vessels in the peripheral regions and the invasive fronts. Qualitative analysis of protease expression and mRNA intensity, in colorectal tumours, revealed increased levels of CB and DPPIV in tumours with clinicopathological parameters associated with metastasis. mRNA localization near tumour vessels highlighted the potential for, not only cancer cells but also tumour endothelial cells, to produce proteolytic enzymes to aid the process of tumour angiogenesis and hence tumour growth and metastasis. The study also demonstrated that the angiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF up-regulated CB and DPPIV activity in human colon, rectal cancer cells and normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The presence of tumour lymph vessels and their positive correlation to metastatic parameters signifies an important role for such vessels in the process of colorectal cancer spread. The positive relationship of tumour blood vessels to parameters associated with metastasis re-instates the important role of tumour angiogenesis in colorectal cancer. Other factors that were investigated such as tumour associated proteases CB and DPPIV and the influence of the potent angiogenic proteins upon their activity suggests that these factors have a direct role in colorectal cancer metastasis. Therefore, it can be concluded from the results of this thesis that <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> counts can be used as a reliable prognostic marker in colorectal cancer. Tumour angiogenic factors as well as the colorectal tumour lymph vessels have the potential to be used as additional prognostic markers in clinical prognostic evaluations. This has important implications in allowing clinicians to accurately assess post-operative survival rates and to devise an effective treatment regimen in order to prolong the lives and possibly cure colorectal cancer patients.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis outlines {{a body of}} research within the field of mathematical oncology that focusses on the inclusion of microenvironmental factors in mathematical models for solid tumour behaviour. These models primarily address tumour angiogenesis signalling, tumour metabolism and inducing apoptosis via novel treatment combinations. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, background material pertinent to cancer biology and treatment is provided in Chapter 2. This chapter details tumour angiogenesis, tumour metabolism and various cancer treatments. This is followed in Chapter 3 by a survey of mathematical models that directly influence my work including summaries of models for relevant tumour entities such as angiogenic growth factors, interstitial fluid pressure, tu- mour metabolism and acidosis. The progression of topics in these two preliminary chapters emulate the ordering of the original research presented in Chapters 4 – 6. Chapter 4 presents an angiogenic growth factor (AGF) model used to study the impact of transport processes on tumour angiogenic behaviour. The study focusses on a coupled system of diffusion-convection-reaction equations that establish the role of convection in determining relative concentrations of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic growth factors, and hence the angiogenic behaviour, in solid tumours. The effect of various cancer treat- ments, such as chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drugs, that can alter tumour properties are considered through parameter analyses. The angiogenesis that results from angiogenic stimulation provides tumours with an oxygen and nutrient supply required for metabolism. Chapter 5 quantifies the benefit of metabolic symbiosis on tumour ATP production. A diffusion-reaction model of cell metabolism in the hypoxic tissue surrounding a leaky <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> is developed that includes both lactate and glucose fuelled respiration along with glycolysis. We can then study the energetic effects of cancer cells’ metabolic behaviour, such as the Warburg effect and metabolic symbiosis. A model coupling these metabolic behaviours with acidosis is also analyzed that includes the effects of extracel- lular buffers. These models can be used to investigate metabolic inhibitor treatments by knocking out specific model parameters and buffering therapies. While treatment effects are considered in the previous chapters via parameter alter- ation, Chapter 6 explicitly models concentrations of molecular inhibitors and chemotherapy nanoparticles. These treatments are coupled to a model for apoptotic protein expression to evaluate strategies for counteracting chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer. The protein model is then used to predict cell viability, which indicates the efficacy of schedules for treatment combinations. The model prediction of post-chemotherapy inhibitor outper- forming pre-chemotherapy and simultaneous application is verified by further experiments. Finally, a summary of the contributions to the field of mathematical oncology and suggested future directions are indicated in the final chapter...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{classification of}} squamous cell carcinomas {{of the oral}} cavity and the oropharynx with regard to state of progression and aggressiveness is primarily based on the TNM staging and the histopathological grading according {{to the standards of}} the UICC. Results offered hereby and its methodical implementation do not in each case measure up to an individual disease. Assessment of angiogenetic processes, being an essential aspect of tumour biology, could serve as an additional means of characterisation. Consistent data for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas are still outstanding. The aim of the current study was to analyse a possible relationship between haemodynamic parameters provided by perfusion computed tomography (PCT), representing the physiological consequences of angiogenesis, and established systems of classification of these carcinomas. Therefore a collective of 42 cases with first-time, untreated oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas was surveyed. In the course of the pretherapeutical staging those patients were, because of being ineligible for MRI, examined by contrast enhanced computed tomography, including a perfusion series in the plane of the greatest tumour expansion. A deconvolution-based software was employed to produce colour coded quantitative maps of blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time and permeability surface area product which were used within the staging to improve delineation of the tumour. Values of regions of interest within the tumour as well as differences between those and measurements inside other structures of the same plane were considered in the context of T-stage (T 2 - 4), N-stage (N 0, N+) and additionally patient age, gender and tumour site. This analysis showed a significantly higher blood volume in T 2 tumours compared to T 3 and T 4 lesions. The values of T 4 tumours were slightly higher than those of T 3 carcinomas. This could be demonstrated for measurements within the tumour as well as for their differences to values of regions of interest in the musculature of the neck. Regarding the other parameters respectively clinicopathological variables no significant results could be obtained, especially when applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Since T-stages 1, 2 and 3 are defined according to the diameter of the lesion, flowing blood volume seems to decrease with the expansion of the primary <b>tumour.</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>vessel</b> supply is of importance to both the spreading of the carcinoma and several conservative therapeutic modalities. The missing correlation between PCT parameters and N-stage points to poor abilities of this technique regarding the prediction of the crucial event of nodal dissemination. To clarify the clinical relevance of the results yielded by this study longitudinal examinations of patients providing data concerning therapeutical results and survival are imaginable...|$|E
40|$|The {{blood supply}} of solid tumours affects {{the outcome of}} {{treatment}} via its influence on the microenvironment of tumour cells and drug delivery. In addition, <b>tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> are an important target for cancer therapy. Intravital microscopy of tumours growing in 'window chambers' in animal models provides a means of directly investigating tumour angiogenesis and vascular response to treatment, {{in terms of both}} the morphology of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> networks and the function of individual vessels. These techniques allow repeated measurements of the same tumour. Recently, multi-photon fluorescence microscopy techniques have been applied to these model systems to obtain 3 D images of the tumour vasculature, whilst simultaneously avoiding some of the problems {{associated with the use of}} conventional fluorescence microscopy in living tissues.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that altering the <b>blood</b> flow in <b>tumours</b> might significantly alter the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and thermotherapy and also of targeted therapy with such vectors as monoclonal antibodies (Zanelli & Fowler, 1974; Bomber et al., 1986; Smyth et al., 1987; Chan et al., 1984). Bomber et al. (1986) showed that the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol increased tumour perfusion rates in a transplanted mouse sarcoma by two to three fold. This was thought to be due to the drug acting on the heart, reducing cardiac output and blood pressure, which in turn resulted in a compensatory sympathetic vasoconstriction in an attempt to maintain <b>blood</b> pressure. <b>Tumour</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> lack smooth muscle (Chan et al., 1984), and do not respond to the compensatory vasoconstriction.
