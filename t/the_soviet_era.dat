In recent years, Russian authors have published some figures but not for the whole course of the battles. The number of Soviet casualties can only be estimated indirectly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era</b> saw drastic {{industrialization}} and militarization of the peninsula. In 1925–1926, significant deposits of apatite {{were discovered in}} the Khibiny Mountains, and the first apatite batch was shipped {{only a few years}} later, in 1929. In 1930, sulfide deposits were discovered in the Moncha area; in 1932–1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River; and in 1935, significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered in the area of modern Afrikanda.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national symbols that were used before <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era.</b> These included a flag of red and white stripes and a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national symbols were replaced by Soviet-era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two symbols, along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|Žirmūnai is well-served by Vilnius' bus and {{trolleybus}} transportation network. One of Vilnius' trolleybus hubs {{is located}} in the northernmost part of Žirmūnai elderate, and Vilniaus Autobusai, Vilnius' main bus operator, is headquartered and has its main depot in Žirmūnai. Žirmūnai suffers from rush hour traffic jams. The street network in the district was primarily designed in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era</b> for a much lower vehicle traffic.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era</b> {{under the}} jurisdiction of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Music in Belarus largely {{comprises}} a rich {{tradition of}} folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions {{can be traced}} back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 19th century, Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich and created the opera Sialanka (Peasant Woman). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet Nightingale by M. Kroshner was composed during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era</b> and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.|$|E

50|$|Ziedonis {{maintained}} an odd balance between dissidence and acceptance in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation <b>era.</b> As {{one of the}} most open voices in poetry during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation <b>era,</b> he repeatedly risked appearing as a dissident to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> leaders. A leading voice in the perestroika period toward the end of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation <b>era,</b> Ziedonis was an outspoken advocate of freer expression and the growth of the Latvian Cultural Fund. This was particularly evident in his first published collection of essays Garainis, kas veicina vārīšanos (1976, Steam That Promotes Boiling). At the same time, Ziedonis never fully broke with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> authorities. Indeed, in 1977, the year following his inflammatory essays, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government awarded him the National Poet of Soviet Latvia prize.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and focused more on absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} were themselves an influence on composers well into <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
5|$|The republic's {{administrative}} divisions {{remained largely}} unchanged from the structure used during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era,</b> with {{the notable exception}} of selsoviets—a low-level administrative unit type abolished after the new law on the administrative-territorial divisions had been adopted in May 2000. As of 2014, the republic's administrative-territorial divisions include seven administrative districts (raions) and two republican urban okrugs. The districts have administrative jurisdiction over the inhabited localities located on their territory. Territories of the republican urban okrugs are separate from the districts and include a city/town of the republican significance, {{as well as one}} or several inhabited localities in their vicinity which had historically been administratively subordinated to that city/town.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the large}} {{hydropower}} plants in Russia date from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era,</b> the abundance of fossil fuels in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation has resulted in little need {{for the development of}} other renewable energy sources. There are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy, which is strongly encouraged by the Russian government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of Russia's energy output, and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in Russia since 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} men present at the battle is disputed. A major factor in this {{is the fact that}} no primary sources give the {{number of men}} present at the battle, which leaves modern historians to {{estimate}} the number of men. Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus' army as 30,000, while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim that the size of the Rus' army was 80,000.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81. de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20,000, while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23,000 men.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 118. However, historian John Fennell, an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history, and one well-versed in the primary sources, calls many of these figures into doubt, saying the numbers given in the Russian sources (there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources, at least none that have survived, and other sources from other cultures, if they exist, are rather dubious) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves. The information given in the Novgorod First Chronicle and the Primary Chronicle would imply a total of 11,000 soldiers for the Rus' forces, but Fennel considers even these numbers to be exaggerations. While Russian historians in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>era</b> have traditionally given estimates of around 80,000-100,000, modern Russian historians have taken a revisionist stance with a consensus settling on drastically lower numbers, with the Mongols having a numerical advantage. Russian historian D.G. Khrustalev estimated in 2013 that the Rus' army consisted of 10,000 soldiers (including mercenaries), while the Cumans brought 5,000 cavalry, for a total of 15,000.Khrustalev, p. 416 Carl Sverdrup estimates the army at 8,000, and says 30,000 and 80,000 are enormous exaggerations. The Mongols evidently believed it was a considerable force, given the extreme lengths the Mongols went to dislocate its formations.|$|E
