5|$|Cochet {{played one}} of his last matches at the Swiss covered courts championships in St. Moritz, {{returning}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> his very first tennis triumph after a 36-year hiatus. At the age of 56 with his partner Bernard Destremau he managed to pass {{the first round of the}} doubles contest with a 6–2, 6–1 win over locals D. Wegs and H. Flury. Cochet retired from tennis later that year.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Henry Dodge was at Gratiot's Grove {{when the}} war descended upon Spafford Farm, having just sent his volunteers to their forts to {{resupply}} and recuperate. Shortly after he arrived back at his home fort, he received word of the Aubrey murder at Fort Blue Mounds and the incident at Spafford Farm. Dodge ordered militia detachments from Fort Defiance, Fort Jackson, and Fort Hamilton <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the massacre.|$|E
5|$|During the autopsy, Peter {{explains}} to Sheriff Mathis (Martha Plimpton) how removing {{a part of}} a brain could provide information to the killers. Mathis' partner, deputy officer Bill Ferguson (Patrick Gilmore), soon disappears. After they go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> Krista's murder, Peter encounters Newton, but he escapes. Peter becomes suspicious of Mathis when he sees blood on her jacket; however, he believes her when she shows him her cut from a fall, which is bleeding normal blood, not the mercury typical of shapeshifters; he then explains the concept of shapeshifters to her.|$|E

As Miles arrives, his car's electricity cuts out, {{causing it to}} crash. After exiting the vehicle, an injured Miles finds his deputy sheriff, Ray Hoese, unconscious in his police cruiser. Miles is suddenly confronted by a man identical to Hoese who is bleeding green fluid, indicating he is an Alien Bounty Hunter.|$|E

5|$|The king retires after a {{night of}} feasting. Lady Macbeth drugs his attendants and lays daggers ready for the {{commission}} of the crime. Macbeth kills the sleeping king while Lady Macbeth waits nearby. When he brings the daggers from the king's room, Lady Macbeth orders him to return them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime. He refuses. She carries the daggers to the room and smears the drugged attendants with blood. The couple retire to wash their hands.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, the {{schooner}} Lioness discovered {{one of the}} cutters, {{and after}} saving the occupants of the second boat made her way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 people still clinging to the rigging. It was reported that of the approximately 643people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward WC Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a brevet majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.|$|E
5|$|Toms ran to {{a nearby}} petrol station for help and a man there gave her his mobile phone to call the police. While making the call, she twice heard Parker cry out in pain.

5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals {{that he is a}} big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{benefited from}} Montagu's withdrawal, {{as his own}} {{battered}} fleet passed close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused {{to allow him to}} enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, the British staged an {{invasion}} of Kentucky {{with the help of}} their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas. When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and met up with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, a salt lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels held an {{exhibition}} marking {{fifty years of}} The Adventures of Tintin. As part of this, they included artefacts that featured in the series, with the broken-eared Peruvian statue that inspired Hergé's Arumbaya fetish as the centre piece of the show; however, they feared {{that it might be}} stolen, so a replica was exhibited rather than the genuine article. Imitating the events of The Broken Ear, a thief broke in and stole the statue. A letter was then sent to Le Soir in which an individual alleging to be the thief stated that the item would be returned if Hergé returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the crime at a certain time with a copy of the book under his right arm. Hergé did so, but carried the book under his left arm; the thief never appeared, and the replica fetish was never recovered.|$|E

5|$|In Boone, North Carolina, Wallace (David Denman) and Angela Schiff (Robyn Lively) {{return home}} after a day out hiking in the fields. Angela gets a {{headache}} and, while taking a shower, thinks that she sees images of a yellow substance running down the walls. Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another's arms but as the camera pans out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains {{in the same position}} {{in the middle of a}} field. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination. Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E
5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, {{in an effort to}} forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to their people, then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E

5|$|Like Borussia, Feyenoord faced {{opposition}} {{from the city of}} Milan in the semi-finals, in the shape of Internazionale. Around 10,000 Feyenoord fans made the trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> Feyenoord’s 1970 European Cup victory for the first leg. Feyenoord won the first leg 1–0 to gain a vital away goal after Iván Córdoba scored an own goal. The second leg started well for Feyenoord after going 2–0 up inside 34 minutes, due to goals from Van Hooijdonk and Jon Dahl Tomasson, to put Feyenoord 3–0 up on aggregate. Inter came back into the tie in the last minutes when they pulled two goals back through Javier Zanetti and Mohamed Kallon, but Feyenoord secured their place in the final with a 3–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|Owing to his keen {{interest}} in the type he followed, with interest, the exploits of Kommando Nowotny, the all jet fighter unit. Although it had low serviceability rates, its aircraft achieved considerable success. To see how new aircraft performed in action, Galland often visited the front line airfields close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the fighting. On 8 November 1944, he was present when ace Walter Nowotny took off with a force of Me 262s in an overcast to engage a USAAF raid. Galland listened to it over the radio waves. Nowotny claimed a bomber but his Me 262 was damaged. He was then jumped by USAAF fighters and crashed close to the airfield. Galland heard the firing but {{did not see the}} event. It did not dissuade him from believing in the capabilities of the aircraft as a fighter.|$|E
5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been {{run over by}} a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
