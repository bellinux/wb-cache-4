5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash <b>trees</b> or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash <b>trees</b> and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying <b>trees.</b> Costs for managing these <b>trees</b> can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested <b>trees</b> at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} <b>trees</b> die through removing known infested <b>trees</b> and treating <b>trees</b> with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace <b>trees</b> that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash <b>trees</b> in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E
5|$|Dead <b>trees</b> pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead <b>trees</b> involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy <b>trees</b> can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs.

5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. <b>Trees</b> are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. <b>Trees</b> tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also <b>trees.</b> <b>Trees</b> have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature <b>trees</b> in the world.|$|E

5|$|Pasvik is {{dominated}} by the old-growth Scots pine, which covers half the park's area. The forest has a very slow life cycle. The age of a typical tree is between 300 and 400 year; the oldest recorded tree was 820 years when chopped down in 1896. Regrowth is slow because the <b>trees</b> need two consecutive years to produce cones and young <b>trees</b> often die after their buds are eaten by moose during winter. The park has been stricken regularly by wildfires—the latest major fire occurring in 1945. Wildfires normally spread and burn in the undergrowth; as pine <b>trees</b> do not have low-laying branches, older pines will not be effected while younger <b>trees</b> will be consumed by the fire. A forest fire can kill tens of generations of <b>trees,</b> but the remaining ashes give good conditions for young <b>trees,</b> giving an uneven age distribution of pine. None of the islands in the lake of Ellensvatn have had fires, giving it a unique forest composition.|$|E
