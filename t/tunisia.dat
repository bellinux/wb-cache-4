When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with <b>Tunisia.</b> The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable <b>Tunisia</b> to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited the Clinton White House in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Operation Torch, the Allied {{invasion}} of French North Africa, precipitated {{a crisis in}} Kesselring's command. He ordered Walther Nehring, the former commander of the Afrika Korps who was returning to action after recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, to proceed to <b>Tunisia</b> to take command of a new corps (XC Corps). Kesselring ordered Nehring to establish a bridgehead in <b>Tunisia</b> and then to press west {{as far as possible}} so as to gain freedom to manoeuvre. By December, the Allied commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, was forced to concede that Kesselring had won the race; the final phase of Torch had failed and the Axis could only be ejected from <b>Tunisia</b> after a prolonged struggle.|$|E

Addax is legally protected in Morocco, <b>Tunisia,</b> and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt.

The addax has been reintroduced in Bou-Hedma National Park (<b>Tunisia)</b> and Souss-Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (<b>Tunisia)</b> and Grand Erg Oriental (Sahara), and another is planned in Morocco.|$|E

5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of <b>Tunisia,</b> near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over <b>Tunisia</b> meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli in January 1943, the {{remaining}} Axis forces retreated to prepared defences in Southern <b>Tunisia,</b> {{in front of the}} Mareth Line built by France before the war. Here in March, Horrocks carried out one of his most successful actions. His corps, composed of the 1stArmoured Division, a Free French brigade and the attached New Zealand Corps (which included the 2nd New Zealand Division and the British 8th Armoured Brigade), was ordered to attack as part of Operation Supercharge after XXXCorps failed to breach the line. He carried out a flanking manoeuvre through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable, rendering the Mareth position untenable and forcing the Axis into another retreat. Three Italian divisions were destroyed, and the German 15th and 21stPanzer Divisions and the 164thDivision were heavily depleted. Horrocks was then transferred to the First Army to take over IXCorps after its previous commander, Lieutenant-General John Crocker, was wounded in a training accident. He led this corps in the final Allied offensive in <b>Tunisia</b> during April and May 1943, capturing Tunis and accepting the surrender of the remnants of Rommel's Army Group Africa. He was mentioned in despatches on 24 June, and for his service in <b>Tunisia,</b> was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 August.
