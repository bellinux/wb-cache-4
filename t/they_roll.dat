Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began squandering in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation among this crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> the dice again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won and kept his fortune, but reportedly still failed to pay the £10,000.|$|E

500|$|Young {{specimens}} of A.hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially {{embedded in the}} substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, breaks open in a star-shaped (...) pattern to form 4–20 irregular [...] "rays". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is hygroscopic, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as <b>they</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Not every {{bird species}} builds or uses a nest. Some auks, for instance—including common murre, thick-billed murre and razorbill—lay their eggs {{directly}} onto the narrow rocky ledges they use as breeding sites. [...] The eggs of these species are dramatically pointed at one end, so that <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> in a circle when disturbed. This is critical {{for the survival of}} the developing eggs, as there are no nests to keep them from rolling {{off the side of the}} cliff. Presumably because of the vulnerability of their unprotected eggs, parent birds of these auk species rarely leave them unattended. Nest location and architecture is strongly influenced by local topography and other abiotic factors.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 a {{group of}} black motorcyclists, and the South Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, sued the city of Myrtle Beach and some {{businesses}} there alleging discrimination. The city was accused of abusing traffic law enforcement and of excessive force by the police to harass black bikers. Many businesses closed their doors or cut back their hours during Black Bike Week, and 28 of them, including Red Lobster and Denny's were named in the suit. A Baltimore, Maryland police detective who is also a motorcyclist told The New York Times, [...] "I've seen it myself. When the white bikers come to Myrtle Beach, the town rolls out the red carpet. When the black riders come, <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> it right up."

2500|$|Just {{south of}} the Zihuatanejo Airport {{there is a large}} archeological site at La Soledad De Maciel and the small town of La Chole. While {{artifacts}} have been found there since the 1930s, excavations were only started between 2000 and 2010. The site was occupied from 3000 BCE to the early 600s CE when it was destroyed by a tsunami. It was occupied by three different cultures and was an important trading city for both Teotihuacan and the Olmec. At its height it had a large population with the site possibly covering a 10 km2 area. Only {{a small part of the}} site has been excavated because most of it is owned by the local farmers who grow fruit trees, vegetables, coconuts for copra and tobacco that <b>they</b> <b>roll</b> into cigars. The Mexican government is in the process of buying back the site but it will be a slow process. Still, what has been uncovered is worth seeing.|$|E

Again the people believe—no matter whether truly or falsely—that if they should escape the hunger and the fever their lives are not safe from judges and juries. They do not look upon the law of the land as a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to those who do well; they scowl on it as an engine of foreign rule, ill-omened harbinger of doom." ...|$|E
