5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It {{may be that the}} firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, a partner in <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end}} of Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The cost was to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line {{south from}} L'Enfant Plaza began in July 1984 when WMATA issued {{a call for}} bids to tunnel under the Anacostia River. <b>The</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) was awarded the $25.6 million contract, with {{construction}} to begin in December 1984. WMATA delayed awarding the contract after American anti-apartheid activists alleged that a Belgian company with a minority financial interest in Franki-Denys did business with the racist white-led government of South Africa, but after the links were discovered to be extremely minor the contract was awarded.|$|E

5|$|Financing of {{the arena}} project was difficult. Terrace had four {{financing}} deals fail. As {{it became clear that}} the Senators could not finance a needed highway interchange without government backing, the Government of Ontario was persuaded successfully to provide a $27 million loan for the highway interchange construction. In the end, <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Ogden Entertainment, a New York City facilities management firm, backed the project with a $20 million loan in exchange for a 30-year contract to manage the facility. In addition, American banks loaned $110 million, the federal government gave the Senators $6 million, $10 million from Terrace and $15 million from a Canadian pension fund.|$|E
5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued {{until well into the}} 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, the Indiana General Assembly {{approved}} {{construction of}} a new statehouse. The building was to be funded by the sale of lots of land in Indianapolis. A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $150 prize to the architect who could design the best statehouse. <b>The</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design. Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon. The building looked very much like the Parthenon except for a large central dome. Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building, and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835.|$|E

5|$|In 1866, William Rockefeller Jr., John's brother, built another {{refinery}} in Cleveland {{and brought}} John into the partnership. In 1867, Henry M. Flagler became a partner, and <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler was established. By 1868, with Rockefeller continuing practices of borrowing and reinvesting profits, controlling costs, and using refineries' waste, the company owned two Cleveland refineries and a marketing subsidiary in New York; {{it was the}} largest oil refinery in the world.

5|$|In {{response}} to the public concern about the mosque's size, the mosque's trustees did not choose Mangera's design for the final plan, deciding instead on a scaled-down structure. Abdul Sattar Shahid, {{speaking on behalf of}} the Tablighi Jamaat trustees, announced that <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Allies and Morrison was retained to design the mosque. In November 2011, it was reported that Allies & Morrison had been replaced by NRAP Architects. An outline planning application was submitted in May 2012. The scheme prepared by NRAP Architects included a prayer hall for over 9000, a refectory for 2000 and an Islamic library set within a public garden. A needs analysis and viability assessment submitted with the planning application seek to demonstrate that the proposals represent a justifiable departure from planning policy.|$|E
