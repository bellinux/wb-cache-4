5|$|In mid-2008, Brown's {{leadership}} {{was presented with}} a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of {{holding on to the}} Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the Autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards. McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} his MBA {{degree in}} 1975, Carper {{went to work}} for the State of Delaware's economic development office. In 1976, after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership, he took out a $5,000 personal loan to fund his campaign for the Treasurer of Delaware. After convincing the party leaders, and later the voters, that he was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be Delaware State Treasurer, he defeated the favored Republican Party candidate, Theodore Jones. He served three terms, from January 18, 1977 through January 3, 1983, during which time he oversaw the development of Delaware's first cash management system.|$|E

25|$|The {{minister-president}} of Rhineland-Palatinate (1969-1976) {{was a young}} reformer in {{a somewhat}} backward state, and a newcomer who heavily criticized the older party leaders. The national media, {{for as much as}} they took notice of him, regarded him with curiosity. But this changed when Kohl became chair of the federal party in 1973, and even more dramatically when in late 1975 his party made him candidate for the chancellery. His opponents within the federal party, but also journalists and other observers, had their doubts whether the parochial but successful modernizer of a manageable smaller state was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> lead the Federal Republic, a huge and complicated industrial country.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, Bose was placed under house-arrest by the Raj. He escaped in {{disguise}} {{and made his way}} through Afghanistan and Central -Asia. He came first to the Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. There he -sought to raise an army of Indian soldiers from prisoners of war captured by Germany, forming the Free India Legion and the Azad Hind Radio. The Japanese ambassador, Oshima Hiroshi, kept Tokyo informed of these developments. From the very start of the war, the Japanese intelligence services noted from speaking to captured Indian soldiers that Bose was held in extremely high regard as a nationalist and was considered by Indian soldiers to be <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be leading a rebel army.|$|E
25|$|Thompson and Governor James Withycombe, both Republicans, {{agreed that}} Bernard Daly, Lake County's long-time county judge and a Democrat, was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be Lake County's new {{district}} court judge. As a result, {{just three days}} after the 1915 legislative session adjourned, Withycombe appointed Daly to Lake County's new district judge position. Thompson filed for re-election to his state senate in January 1916. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Shortly after the primary, he announced he would seek a second term as Senate President and began meeting with carry-over senators and Republican candidates for the senate. However, Thompson lost his senate seat in the general election to Judge George T. Baldwin of Klamath Falls by one vote. Thompson won Crook, Jefferson, and Lake counties with a 325-vote margin, but lost Klamath County by 326 votes. At the time, newspapers speculated that he may have lost his seat {{as a result of his}} litigation work dealing with disputed water rights in south central Oregon.|$|E

500|$|When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{considered}} a 20-year contract extension for the Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station in Plymouth in mid-2012, Keating repeatedly {{took to the}} press.

[...] When the commission voted to renew the license, Keating joined other Massachusetts politicians in deriding the decision as premature. During a labor strike later in the year, Keating joined U.S. Representative Ed Markey in challenging the qualifications of the plant's replacement workers.|$|E
500|$|Sexuality {{is one of}} {{the primary}} themes of the novel. Letters by Brooke {{recently}} rediscovered by historians expressed much conflict within himself about his own sexuality. This same sexual conflict becomes a major element of Dawson's novel. Nell is consistently shocked by Brooke's sexual desires and encounters throughout the novel, {{while at the same time}} Brooke is confused by his lustful desires for Nell and his desire to court sexually constrained upper-class women. Brooke has other causes of internal conflict. In his search for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> lose his virginity to, he has a homosexual encounter almost out of desperation. The continual conflict between a desire to be loved, and the inability to find a lover is ironic when compared to the title of the novel and poem which inspired the novel: Brooke is clearly not a [...] "great lover".|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Washington Post writer Bob Woodward {{reported}} that Hillary Clinton {{had been having}} [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with Eleanor Roosevelt {{from the start of}} Clinton's time as First Lady. Following the Democrats' loss of congressional control in the 1994 elections, Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent Jean Houston. Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding séances with Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, provided you choose <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Knut Helle, Harald {{completed the}} first phase of what he has termed the [...] "national territorial unification of Norway". Having forced his way to the kingship, Harald would have to convince the aristocracy that he was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> rule Norway alone. To establish domestic alliances, he married Tora Torbergsdatter {{of one of the most}} powerful Norwegian families. The primary opposition to Harald's rule would be the descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson, from the powerful dynasty of Earls of Lade who had controlled Northern Norway and Trøndelag with much autonomy under the Norwegian king. Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway (nominally under the Danish king) from 975 until 995, when he was killed during the takeover by Olaf Tryggvasson. Even after Haakon's death, his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north, and by Harald's early reign the family was headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, who was married to Haakon's daughter. While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus, Harald's absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar.|$|E

We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her.

500|$|Laming's {{appointment}} was controversial {{as he had}} been director of Hertfordshire county council's social services department in 1990, a department which was strongly criticised for its handling of a child abuse case, and which had the Local Government Ombudsman making a finding of 'maladministration with injustice' against them in 1995. The father of the child in the case said of Laming's appointment, [...] "I don't see how he has the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990". Liberal Democrat spokesman Paul Burstow said, [...] "the findings of the ombudsman in the Hertfordshire case must give rise to questions about Lord Laming's appointment to head this inquiry"; and Conservative Party spokesman Liam Fox said, [...] "I think the government maybe should have thought twice about this and maybe, even yet, they will think again". The Department for Health, however, said that they were [...] "fully confident that he is <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> conduct the inquiry".|$|E
500|$|In {{keeping with}} its nature as propaganda, {{the content of}} Mt. Paektu exaggerates Kim Il-sung's {{activities}} during the liberation struggle. The poem presents Kim as having heroic, transcendental, humane and warm qualities. He is represented as a popular hero that the people look up to, suggesting that he is <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> lead the newly established state. Politically, Mt. Paektu was very effective in the newly founded state. As such, it became a [...] "new classic", {{a model for the}} cult of personality of Kim Il-sung perpetuated by subsequent works of literature in North Korea. According to B. R. Myers, the work exemplifies particular traits of an early cult of personality built upon Soviet Marxism–Leninism and bloc conformity, which were soon replaced by Korean ethnic nationalism of writers like Han Sorya. While Cho's Kim Il-sung is a brilliant strategist who has masculine qualities like strength and intellect, in Han's works he embodies traditional Korean virtues of innocence and naivety having [...] "mastered Marxism–Leninism with his heart, not his brain". The ethnically inspired style of Han would establish itself as the standard of propaganda over Cho's. Benoit Berthelier, however, sees continuity in Cho's work and contemporary propaganda. According to him, Cho can be credited with having created a genre of [...] "revolutionary romanticism", which systematized the use of legends and supernatural imagery in Kim and his successors' cult of personality.|$|E
500|$|The President also {{appoints}} other Ministers to the Cabinet {{from among}} the MPs, acting {{in accordance with the}} Prime Minister's advice. Any MP, including a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) or a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), may be appointed a Minister. Thus it is possible for a person who was not elected by voters to be appointed by Parliament as an NMP, then by the President as a Minister. In 1990, then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in Parliament: [...] "I would rather that a government has the flexibility to appoint <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be the minister for finance, than to compel that government to select from whoever is available in the House." [...] However, he added that the Government had no intention to appoint a Cabinet minister {{from among the}} NMPs at that time. In May 2009, MP Hri Kumar proposed during a Parliamentary debate that this stand be reconsidered as the Prime Minister would be able to draw on the experience of many capable Singaporeans. He expressed the view that this would not offend democratic principles. Singapore's Parliamentary system placed more weight on the party in power rather than individual MPs, and [...] "Parliamentarians must still win the support from the ground and, ultimately, the PM and the ruling party and his Cabinet team will still be answerable to the electorate at elections." [...] Critics have commented that adopting the practice would disenchant Singaporeans, deepen the already parochial political culture, and lead to a lack of accountability and legitimacy.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{was given}} {{complete}} creative {{control over the}} new television project by Paramount, which had promised him {{that it would be}} able to make the project a [...] "first-class effort" [...] with the budget to suit. Matt Jefferies, who had worked on The Original Series, was recruited as a technical advisor. He had designed the original USS Enterprise alongside Pato Guzman, but was unwilling to give up a position on the television series Little House on the Prairie for a 13-episode order on a new Star Trek series. Roddenberry was adamant that Jefferies was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> update the Enterprise, and agreed a position that the designer could advise the new show, but would have to choose between it and his main duties on Little House on the Prairie if the Star Trek work started to interfere. This occurred quite quickly, after Jefferies conducted design work on the new version of the Enterprise at a hotel in Tucson, Arizona while on a location shoot for Little House on the Prairie, and could not attend meetings with Roddenberry and the producers in Los Angeles. He recommended Joseph R. Jennings as the main art director on the series; Jennings had worked to Jefferies during the [...] and [...] seasons of The Original Series. Jefferies' re-design of the Enterprise was based on the principle that the technology was updated over time, but the general hull remained the same. He highlighted that the engines would specifically be designed to be replaced, so the external design of them was changed. Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures was hired to produce the physical model of the vessel, which was cast in moulds from fiberglass. Two models were built, a [...] version and a [...] version.|$|E
