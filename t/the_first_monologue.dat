6000|$|We can see {{the matter}} best by taking an {{imaginary}} parallel. Suppose that a poet {{of the type of}} Browning lived some centuries hence and found in some cause célèbre of our day, such as the Parnell Commission, an opportunity for a work similar in its design to The Ring and the Book. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>monologue,</b> which would be called [...] "Half-London," [...] would be the arguments of an ordinary educated and sensible Unionist who believed that there really was evidence that the Nationalist movement in Ireland was rooted in crime and public panic. The [...] "Otherhalf-London" [...] would be the utterance of an ordinary educated and sensible Home Ruler, who thought that in the main Nationalism was one distinct symptom, and crime another, of the same poisonous and stagnant problem. The [...] "Tertium Quid" [...] would be some detached intellectual, committed neither to Nationalism nor to Unionism, possibly Mr. Bernard Shaw, who would make a very entertaining Browning monologue. Then of course would come the speeches of the great actors in the drama, the icy anger of Parnell, the shuffling apologies of Pigott. But we should feel that the record was incomplete without another touch which in practice has so {{much to do with the}} confusion of such a question. Bottinius and Hyacinthus de Archangelis, the two cynical professional pleaders, with their transparent assumptions and incredible theories of the case, would be represented by two party journalists; one of whom was ready to base his case either on the fact that Parnell was a Socialist or an Anarchist, or an Atheist or a Roman Catholic; and the other of whom was ready to base his case on the theory that Lord Salisbury hated Parnell or was in league with him, or had never heard of him, or anything else that was remote from the world of reality. These are the kind of little touches for which we must always be on the look-out in Browning. Even if a digression, or a simile, or a whole scene in a play, seems to have no point or value, let us wait a little and give it a chance. He very seldom wrote anything that did not mean a great deal.|$|E

The male vocal also complaints about worldwide-reaching conspiracy by neighbors of ethnic Macedonians to falsify the historical truth at {{the disadvantage of}} Macedonians.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, British {{soap opera}} EastEnders long-time {{character}} Dot Branning had <b>the</b> show's <b>first</b> <b>monologue</b> episode, {{during which she}} starts singing [...] "Pretty Baby" [...] and telling the tape recorder (for her sick husband, Jim Branning) about her childhood, saying the song was always sung for her as a child by her beloved uncle.|$|R
5000|$|Dialogues - In {{almost every}} episode, the Chaser members discuss a various recent event or {{generalised}} stunt. Most of these dialogues {{lead to a}} pre-produced stunt, ad or trailer.

50|$|Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Ulysses, {{published}} in 1842, {{has been called}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> true dramatic <b>monologue.</b> After Ulysses, Tennyson's most famous efforts in this vein are Tithonus, The Lotos-Eaters, and St. Simon Stylites, all from the 1842 Poems; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably Idylls of the King.|$|R

5000|$|Dirty jokes {{were once}} {{considered}} subversive and underground, and rarely heard in public. Comedian Lenny Bruce was tried, convicted, and jailed for obscenity after a stand up performance that included off-color humor in New York City in 1964. Comedian and actor Redd Foxx {{was well known}} in nightclubs in the 1960s and 1970s for his raunchy stand-up act, but toned it down for the television shows Sanford and Son and The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour, stating in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>monologue</b> of the latter show that the only similarity between the show and his nightclub act was that [...] "I'm smoking". [...] American society has become increasingly tolerant of off-color humor since that time. Such forms of humor have become widely distributed and more socially acceptable, {{in part due to}} the mainstream success in the 1970s and 1980s of comedians like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's alter-egos Derek and Clive, Dolemite, and Andrew Dice Clay. George Carlin and Richard Pryor have used it as an effective tool for social commentary.|$|E
500|$|In {{the vision}} of the band the album is a {{collection}} of unpublished [...] "short stories" [...] from a hypothetical author, complete with the author's notes, and sectioned thematically by the use of four monologues. The stories are told in parallel to the author's own ambiguous loss and struggle, and the lyrics are a combination of Dreyer's fictional stories and his interactions in life, including true stories from La Dispute's home town, Grand Rapids. The four monologues in question project the loss and the struggle of the artist with the introduction 'a Departure', and the three interludes, 'a Letter', 'a Poem' and 'a Broken Jar'. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> two <b>monologues</b> of Wildlife were used to [...] "capture a general feeling". 'a Poem' and 'a Broken Jar' are noted for using spoken word and alternative folk-influenced melodies to spark melodramatic feelings.|$|R

5000|$|As [...] "the {{evolution}} of Peach", and [...] "You Lied" [...] being Peach's best known and arguably most popular song, Suns of the Tundra frequently incorporate the song into their live sets to this day. The {{inclusion of the}} song has however caused younger fans to ask them why they're playing [...] "Tool covers". [...] "You Lied" [...] was performed at the Download Festival at Donington Park in 2006, where Suns of the Tundra opened the festival on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> day. <b>The</b> <b>monologue</b> section was performed there by Laszlo Pallagi III, the only Hungarian to perform at Donington Park. Footage of this is again available on Suns of the Tundra's website. Incidentally, the headline act for that first day at Donington were Tool.|$|R
5000|$|Yvon Deschamps' monologues {{were known}} for their unrelenting irony, and often buried a message that was {{completely}} opposite to what the stage character was saying literally. For Deschamps' <b>first</b> <b>monologue,</b> Les unions, qu'ossa donne?, he created an exploited worker who incarnated the Québécois self-image of a historic past as water-carriers and hewers of wood, and who remained resolutely blind to his exploitation {{at the hands of}} his [...] "good" [...] boss.|$|R
2500|$|His mother (who the {{interviewer}} William Cook said {{sounds like a}} frightful snob) was a major inspiration for Edna, although he denied it when she was alive to protect her feelings. Her <b>first</b> <b>monologue</b> in 1955 was about her lovely home, reflecting young Barry’s own site visits accompanying his builder father. [...] Originally she was a [...] "mousy" [...] character and too quiet to please the raucous crowd at the Establishment Club in London.|$|R

50|$|His {{fortunes}} {{began to}} revive in 1963 with Mr. Whatnot, again premiering at the Victoria Theatre. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow performances today, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> play {{to receive a}} West End performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part down to misguided casting. After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, <b>first</b> writing a <b>monologue</b> for Tommy Cooper, and later with Ronnie Barker, who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of Mr Whatnot in 1964, for the scripts of for LWT's Hark at Barker. Ayckbourn used the pseudonym 'Peter Caulfield' because he was under exclusive contract to the BBC at the time.|$|R
50|$|The Public's 18th {{season in}} early 1993 was {{highlighted}} by Mad Forest, a play directed by Mark Wing Davey, and playwright Caryl Churchill attended <b>the</b> <b>first</b> preview. <b>The</b> following year, The Public’s future Producing Artistic Director Ted Pappas began directing at The Public with the musical Wings.16 Also in 1994, the Public’s Education Department organized its <b>first</b> Shakespeare <b>Monologue</b> & Scene Contest for students.17 In 1995, Amazing Grace, by Michael Cristofer, {{was directed by}} Eddie Gilbert and starred Marsha Mason. In the same season, the Reduced Shakespeare Company made its first of several future appearances at the O'Reilly Theater. August Wilson was in residence at Pittsburgh Public Theater in 1996 to rework his play Jitney, {{one of his most}} famous masterworks. In 1997, The Public's previous box office records were broken by Over the Tavern, a play by Tom Dudzick.|$|R

50|$|Georges Feydeau {{was born}} in Paris, the son of novelist Ernest-Aimé Feydeau and Léocadie Boguslawa Zalewska. At the age of twenty, Feydeau wrote his <b>first</b> comic <b>monologue</b> in earnest. He found his first success four years later with Tailleur pour dames (Ladies' Dressmaker, 1889). That same year Feydeau married Marianne Carolus-Duran, the {{daughter}} of the famous portrait painter Carolus-Duran. To Feydeau, the marriage brought wealth that would sustain him until he found greater success. The marriage lasted 15 years after which the couple underwent a judicial separation and were formally divorced in 1916.|$|R
5000|$|For various record labels, he {{recorded}} 78rpm discs of parodies like [...] "Cohen on the Telephone" [...] and [...] "Cohen Phones to His Friend Levy".

5000|$|The {{production}} {{begins with}} a news reporter announcing the fall of Tony Blair, before the erstwhile prime minister is carried onstage, funeral-style, by four pallbearers, to melancholic chants of [...] "Tony!". He is then thrown to the ground to the crash of a drum fill, where he begins to sing the opening number, [...] "Tony's Entrance," [...] in which he declares his intention to recount {{the past ten years}} of his career to the audience, while the ex-pallbearers perform an ironic 1990s boy band-style dance. It then returns to Blair's election victory in 1997, in which he waves to adoring crowds and congratulates deputy prime minister John Prescott and chancellor Gordon Brown on their success. An aide then arrives to tell him the people are calling for him, at which point a second aide rushes on with a guitar for him to play. A single spotlight then illuminates Tony for his <b>first</b> <b>monologue,</b> in which he tells of the wonder of these first glorious days in power, and of how he became the 'people's prime minister.' He then kneels to pray, attempting to sneakily ask God for a report on how he's doing so far, before being interrupted by the angelic ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales. A clearly uninterested Diana tells him to become the next princess, the people's prime minister, and then warns him against a future of joining George W. Bush in invading Iraq, before drifting mysteriously away, leaving a completely nonplussed Tony in the spotlight.|$|R
5000|$|Deschamps {{proposed}} a musical review to Louise Forestier and Robert Charlebois with Mouffe on board, {{and very little}} rehearsal time. The result would be known as L'Osstidcho (L'hostie de show or [...] "The freaking show"), a show that would revolutionize Quebec song. Inspired by Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant, Deschamps made his <b>first</b> real <b>monologue</b> part of the review when Robert Charlebois {{did not want to}} learn his lines for the dialogue (he decided to strum the guitar instead). In Les unions, qu'ossa donne? (Unions, What are they Good For?), Deschamps played a naïve worker extolling the great generosity and good-heartedness of his boss, making it clear that reality was not quite so rosy: ...|$|R
5000|$|After playing {{football}} at Ithaca College, Chance transferred to New York University where {{he earned a}} BA in English & Writing, {{with the intention of}} pursuing a career as a writer. But, after losing a bet and in spite of a profound fear of public speaking, he entered an acting class. He was so terrified that he gave his <b>first</b> <b>monologue</b> (Brick from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) to a brick wall. While pursuing his acting career, he also entered the amateur boxing circuit in NYC, winning the Superheavyweight division of the NYC Metros tournament. The following year, he entered the NYC Golden Gloves, winning his first fight by knockout, only to have to subsequently drop out of the competition for work on the film The Devil's Own. A few years later, he also earned an MS from Columbia University. He played Lt. Col. Stephen [...] "Godfather" [...] Ferrando in HBO's Generation Kill. After reading the book upon which the adaptation was based, Kelly embarked on a five-month shoot in Africa, from May to December 2007. He also developed a unique, raspy voice for the role. The Boston Globe praised the [...] "fierce edge" [...] Kelly's performance brought to the series, opining, [...] "Godfather leads with the competitive fury of a high school football coach. His eyes are cold fire, and Kelly, like a few other members of this cast, deserves notice at Emmy time next year." [...] On Memorial Day 2009, he was appointed Honorary Marine by the Marine Corps League (Cpl. Philip A. Reynolds Detachment - 203, Freehold, New Jersey) for his work in Generation Kill.|$|R

40|$|Medical {{information}} is notoriously difficult {{to convey to}} patients because the content is complex, emotionally sensitive, and hard to explain without recourse to technical terms. We describe a pilot system for communicating the contents of electronic health records (EHRs) to patients. It generates two alternative presentations, which we have compared in a preliminary evaluation study: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> takes <b>the</b> form of a monologue, which elaborates the information taken from the patient’s EHR by adding explanations of some concepts and procedures; the second {{takes the form of}} a scripted dialogue, in which the content is recast as a series of questions, answers and statements assigned to two characters in the dialogue, a senior and a junior nurse. Our discourse planning method designs these presentations in tandem, <b>first</b> producing a <b>monologue</b> plan which is then elaborated into a dialogue plan. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Cooke's {{short story}} Why You Should Not Put Your Hand Through The Ice won runner-up prize in the MacAllan/Scotland on Sunday Short Story Competition.

In 2006 her short story Skin And Bones was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, performed by the actress Laura Fraser. Cooke's poetry {{of the same year}} addressed environmental issues. Her second novel Under the Mountain, published in 2008, showed a greater political emphasis than her previous work. This novel combined her interest in personal fabrications with wider social memes such as terrorism, and specifically with the construction of potentially false narratives around terrifying events (see Aesthetica interview). The political emphasis in Cooke's work continued in 2009 with the performance of her <b>first</b> dramatic <b>monologue,</b> Protective Measures, at the Kikinda Short Story Festival in Serbia.|$|R

5000|$|The Metamorphoses {{places a}} large {{emphasis}} on the narrative device of the extended monologue. The epic features thirteen monologues that are a minimum of fifteen lines and are delivered by {{a wide variety of}} characters. The purpose of these monologues is exactly the same as their purpose in ancient tragedy: [...] "to articulate thoughts, laments, questions, plans, and rationales" [...] that would otherwise not be expressed in the action or that must be shown in a <b>first</b> person narration. <b>Monologues</b> in Ovid's epics, as in their tragic predecessors, aim to transform the character in some way by calling attention to their inner workings and emotions and how they affect the dramatic action surrounding them.|$|R

40|$|First Person Singular (Plural) is {{a script}} and {{performance}} piece that explores female/feminine identity. The script, set for five female performers, {{is comprised of}} eight <b>first</b> person <b>monologues,</b> one group interactive sketch and an additional monologue that runs intermittently throughout the piece. The semi-autobiographical monologues discuss issues of particular concern to women such as rape, body image and the delegitimation of the feminine in Western religious tradition. Other monologues discuss topics of broad social concern such as acknowledging narrative bias, the silencing of democratic voice, {{and the importance of}} exploring one’s personal history and intellectual histories. Each monologue stands alone to express a particular experience {{in the life of a}} woman. Taken together, the monologues come to represent the many facets of a singular woman’s identity. The piece was performed live on Thursday, April 16, 2001 to an audience of approximately 140 people at The House in DeKalb, Illinois. Both the script and a video tape copy of the live performance are available on file in the Northern Illinois University Honors Program Capstone archives and in the Northern Illinois University Women’s Studies Program Library...|$|R
