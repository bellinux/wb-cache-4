5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better</b> suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E

25|$|During the 1660s, Shrew {{was adapted}} by John Lacy as Sauny the Scot, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better</b> match with Fletcher's sequel. Originally {{performed}} under the Taming of the Shrew title, {{the play was}} published in 1698 as Sauny the Scot: or, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comedy. This version inconsistently anglicised the character names and recast the play in prose. Lacy also expanded the part of Grumio into the title role Sauny (who speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue), which he played himself. Sauny is an irreverent, cynical companion to Petruchio, and is comically terrified of his master's new bride. Lucentio was renamed Winlove, Baptista became Lord Beaufoy and Katherina was renamed Meg. In Sauny, Petruchio is much more vicious, threatening to whip Meg if she doesn't marry him, then telling everyone she is dead, and tying her to a bier. The play ends with her thoroughly tamed. Lacy's work premiered at Drury Lane in 1667, starring Susanna Verbruggen and George Powell. Samuel Pepys saw it on 9 April and again on 1 November, enjoying it on both occasions. The play was popular enough that it was still being performed as late as 1732, when it was staged at Goodman's Fields Theatre, {{and it seems to}} have supplanted Shrews place on the English stage {{for the rest of the}} seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth.|$|E

500|$|SFX Magazine Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Beast Below" [...] {{four out}} of five stars, calling it [...] "immensely satisfying". He {{particularly}} praised the two lead performances and Amy's characterisation as companion, as well as the writing and dialogue. Dan Martin, also of The Guardian, praised the story for testing the characters' relationships rather than being just a visit to the Starship UK <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better,</b> though he commented that the [...] "anti-vivisection message" [...] seemed to be lost along the way. He praised the way the Doctor was portrayed in terms of his more inhumane instincts in contrast to the Tenth Doctor and rated the episode as [...] "{{four out of}} five". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern said that the episode [...] "neither moved [...] to wave a Save the Starwhale banner nor reach for the nearest harpoon" [...] and made him feel [...] "out of the loop" [...] as it seemed more directed at children than adults. However, he praised the acting of Smith, Gillan, and Sophie Okonedo, as well as the creation of the Smilers.|$|E

Delson also contributed ideas of [...] "internal and external struggles", metaphorically depicted on a battlefield, where images such as [...] "flesh tearing and transforming into different forms and brittle shards of crystal erupting from organic matter" [...] would recur. Shinoda explained: [...] "We try to approach our art—packaging, merchandise, tour visuals, videos, anything—in a holistic way. All the parts are interconnected, and by creating great imagery {{that can be used in}} multiple contexts, we can immerse the fans in a universe that is consistent and unique to each release.

The account credits Gastorius, believing himself {{to be on his}} death bed, with composing the hymn melody as music for his funeral.

2500|$|The story's events {{take place}} on a Sunday in winter and center around Sam Slovoda, a sort of bourgeois everyman, who senses that his life is dull and even why it's dull, but cannot take the risks {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better.</b> Sam and his situation seem to reflect what Mailer viewed as the malaise of middle-class America in the 1950s, created and maintained by the language of psychoanalysis and the privileging of the rational mind over lived experience. Mailer saw {{a new type of}} totalitarianism threatening America: that of middle-class comfort and conformity. [...] "Yoga" [...] examines the cost of a structured and secure middle-class life on a character who is aware of his mediocrity, but can do nothing to rise above it. [...] "Yoga" [...] is also a story about the creation of art and finding one's voice, perhaps part of Mailer's attempt to exorcise his own literary demons after the success of The Naked and the Dead.|$|E

2500|$|... "Berlin", set {{later in}} the season, {{features}} Tony and Ziva departing for Germany to track down Ilan Bodnar, her father's killer. Before the episode aired, Glasberg disclosed that they would share a slow dance while there, resulting in [...] "a very personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms". De Pablo added, [...] "You also see [...] as a man Teddy Bear — like, a very sweet but manly man, a guy who's really {{taking care of a}} situation and really wants <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>better,</b> a guy who's not looking for the joke or is uncomfortable staring at a woman or reaching out to hold her hand." [...] This is highlighted in the closing scenes as the two of them drive home from the airport, and Ziva explains her animosity towards Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), the new director of Mossad: Elbaz was the reason her parents split up. She tells Tony, [...] "If it were not for Orli, things would be different. I would be a different person." [...] Tony then takes her hand, and Ziva intertwines their fingers together. Tony replies, [...] "Then I should catch her before she leaves, you know, and thank her."
