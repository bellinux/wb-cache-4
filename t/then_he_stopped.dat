In 2006, the paper received protests regarding its policy against including birth announcements from same-sex couples.

500|$|Later that year, Gosling {{starred in}} the violent revenge drama Only God Forgives, {{directed}} by Drives Nicolas Winding Refn. Gosling undertook Muay Thai training {{in preparation for the}} role, and has described the script as [...] "the strangest thing I’ve ever read". Both the film and his performance drew negative reviews. David Edelstein of New York Magazine stated: [...] "Gosling looked like a major actor as a skinhead in The Believer and a star in Half Nelson. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> acting and started posing. His performance in Only God Forgives (would God forgive that title?) is one long, moist stare". Stephen Holden of the New York Times criticized Gosling's inability [...] "to give his automaton any suggestion of an inner life". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commented that Gosling, while [...] "meant to be a blank page for us to write on, often looks merely blank".|$|E

50|$|Some time later, {{and having}} {{recovered}} from his wound, Hong-rim {{realizes that the}} Queen {{is still in the}} palace, and not on the run, as his subordinates were ordered to tell him.

2500|$|... "Satchel Ass" [...] or [...] "Bucket Butt" [...] or [...] "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he {{introduced}} me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped.</b> It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
60|$|Sir Leicester, left alone, {{remains in}} the same attitude, {{as though he were}} still {{listening}} and his attention were still occupied. At length he gazes round the empty room, and finding it deserted, rises unsteadily to his feet, pushes back his chair, and walks a few steps, supporting himself by the table. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>stops,</b> and with more of those inarticulate sounds, lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>stopped.</b> 'I hadn't {{really any}} hope,' he said.|$|R

60|$|He {{trotted out}} {{and began to}} run {{back and forth with}} his nose to the ground, hoping that his nose would tell him what his eyes couldn't. Back and forth, back and forth <b>he</b> ran, and <b>then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|R

"This time {{it seems}} to come from inside the cabin, and it isn't until the man looks around and sees {{everything}} quiet that he gets up, without speaking, and makes a dash for the door, and tears round outside the cabin like mad, but finds nothing but silence and darkness. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> comes back swearing and calls the dog. But that great yellow dog that the boys would have staked all their money on is crouching under the bunk, {{and has to be}} dragged out like a coon from a hollow tree, and lies there, his eyes starting from their sockets; every limb and muscle quivering with fear, and his very hair drawn up in bristling ridges. The man calls him to the door. He drags himself a few steps, stops, sniffs, and refuses to go further. The man calls him again, with an oath and a threat. Then, what does that yellow dog do? He crawls edgewise towards the door, crouching himself against the bunk till he's flatter than a knife blade; <b>then,</b> half way, <b>he</b> <b>stops.</b> <b>Then</b> that d--d yellow dog begins to walk gingerly--lifting each foot up in the air, one after the other, still trembling in every limb. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> again. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> crouches. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> gives one little shuddering leap--not straight forward, but up,--clearing the floor about six inches, as if--" ...|$|R

60|$|Several minutes passed. George was {{thinking}} {{more about the}} mail-carrier's movements than about Edgar's.
