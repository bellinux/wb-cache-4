Annual sediment rating curves better accounted for the variability in precipitation events from year to year, which may {{be at least as}} important as total rainfall, on the amount of runoff and sediment yield. Measure ments before and after oak removal indicated small but not statistically significant increases in the runoff/rainfall ratio and fewer tons of sediment leaving the watershed after cutting.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish the rate of occurrence of opportunistic parasites in patients with bone-marrow transplants. As a result of reduced immunity due to immunosuppresive therapy, these patients are more susceptible to multiple infections, in particular to infections caused by opportunistic parasites. The parasites were detected using MIFC sedimentation, staining according to Miláček-Vítovec and Calcofluor staining. These methods were used to investigate a total of 100 samples, of which 4 were positive for the presence of microporidia. The presence of microsporidia in the four samples was confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Occurrence of other opportunistic parasites was not confirmed. Microsporidia were found in 7, 4 % of patients with bone-marrow transplants. This fact was rather surprising as the increasing number of patients with suppressed immunity is associated with increased occurrence of these opportunistic parasites as well.

40|$|Nuclear waste {{management}} is more then finding a technical {{answer to a}} technical problem. Dealing with nuclear, or {{any other form of}} hazardous waste, for that matter, not only implies solving a technical problem, it also means solving a societal problem. And societal questions cannot be resolved in a technical laboratory. Of course, the technical aspect of nuclear {{waste management}} and disposal is a very important one, but the societal aspect is of equal importance. In order to find an implementable solution to deal with nuclear waste, attention should be paid to what kind of solution the society wants and under what conditions a proposed solution might be acceptable. This, however, cannot be achieved by simply adding a number of ''societal parameters'' to a technical concept modeling. It is something that can only be established through interaction with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>concerned.</b> And that, in addition, is not something that can be preformed as an accidental spin off of a vastly elaborated technical program. Communicating or interacting with the public does not mean sweeping them off their feet with smoothly edited leaflets explaining how technically sound the proposed solution is and how wonderful it would fit in their back yard. Adding, just to proof how brilliantly this all has been thought through, numerous safety measures, so people would feel reassured. This kind of communication, will only activate people's suspicion and drive them straight into a ''NIMBY''-reaction. The public (and by this we mean the stakeholders or the people actually concerned) should be involved in the decision making on nuclear waste from the very start of the program. This means that they must be {{aware of the fact that}} tests are taken place, that they can participate in the follow up of these technical analysis, and, that they have a say in whether further steps will eventually be taken...|$|E
40|$|Siim Lõvi´s {{bachelor}} thesis ”Coverage of the Baltic Sea pollution thematic in Eesti Päevaleht in 2006 ” analyses how {{the newspaper}} kept an important environmental issue on public agenda {{and how the}} problem was framed throughout the year. The topic of sea pollution was first introduced at the newspaper agenda {{in the end of}} January when a widespread oil leakage was found on the North-Western shore of Estonia, killing thousands of seabirds. Drawing upon Ulrich Beck’s risk society theory, a theoretical presupposition to the current analysis is that media has an influential role in defining risks, especially in the case when the topic is unknown for the audience and hence all information about it is meditated by media. Thus for the public it is crucial, how the media portraits risks - such as oil leakage in the Baltic Sea. Media has to cover a risk thoroughly to keep <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>concerned.</b> The debate in the opinion section of the newspaper is also vital for the development of ideas how to deal with risks. Those ideas can lead to political actions that might resolve the insufficiencies that became apparent in dealing with oil leakages. In the analysis, 225 articles published on the issue in Eesti Päevaleht during 2006 were analysed, using both the quantitative content analysis method and the qualitative analysis. The results of the study show that the daily Eesti Päevaleht covered the topic of sea pollution widely when there was a newsworthy event. However on other periods, the coverage was much lower which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} public debate on opinion pages did not show continuity. Only on some occasions there where opinion articles that reintroduced the problem. Besides covering the main topic of sea pollution and its effects on wildlife, four distinct frames where found in the analyzed articles. First, there was a significant number of articles dealing with the topic of political responsibility during the first of five periods analyzed. The frame mostly associated with sea pollution was the problem of resource insufficiency. Eesti Päevaleht covered proposals how to improve the situation, however did not offer any actual solutions. Nor did it question their validity. Also the lack of effective resolutions to sea pollution episodes was framed as an error of the official’s judgment and as a result of legitimate and organizational faults. Eesti Päevaleht succeeded in contextualizing individual events of sea pollution into a wider problem. Criticism of the lack of (state) resources to combat sea pollution led to a larger debate on the underfinancing of the entire internal security system in Estonia...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{justice is}} an {{increasingly}} important element of policy making in transportation. It is not specific to any mode of transportation, particular community, or single policy issue. It is fundamentally about fairness toward the disadvantaged and often addresses the exclusion of racial and ethnic minorities from decision making. The federal government has identified environmental justice as an important goal in transportation, and local and regional governments must incorporate environmental justice into transportation programs. Because ideas about justice differ between communities, local and regional governments have flexibility in how they change their policies to reflect environmental justice. Communities and local governments struggle to balance competing interests and interpretations of environmental justice. To parents living in a neighborhood {{with a lot of}} bus service, environmental justice might mean converting buses from diesel to natural gas, reducing their children’s exposure to air pollution. A security guard working the night shift might feel that environmental justice has been served if the bus she takes deviates from its regular route to drop her off closer to home. Environmental justice to a non-English speaking neighborhood might mean having bilingual staff and community leaders running a public meeting. To low-income workers relying on bus service in a large downtown, environmental justice might mean that a city increases the frequency of buses instead of building a new light rail line that would serve upper-income commuters. In short, there is no single definition of environmental justice: its meaning depends on context, perspective and timeframe. Environmental justice issues arise most frequently when: Some communities get the benefits of improved accessibility, faster trips, and congestion relief, while others experience fewer benefits; Some communities suffer disproportionately from transportation programs’ negative impacts, like air pollution; Some communities have to pay higher transportation taxes or higher fares than others in relation to the services that they receive; or Some communities are less represented than others when policy-making bodies debate and decide what should be done with transportation resources. Racial and ethnic minority groups, low-income people, the elderly, and people with disabilities have all been the victims of environmental injustices in transportation. Sometimes an affected community is primarily geographic, consisting of those living in a particular corridor or in a neighborhood near a certain transportation facility. Or those affected might share similar racial, ethnic, or economic characteristics. These groups are often referred to as “environmental justice communities. ” But because power and needs change over time and space, the term “environmental justice communities” is problematic. Environmental justice is used to protect the needs of the powerless, whomever they might be, and as they change. Many community members are becoming involved with transportation decisions that impact their mobility needs, health, and overall quality of life. A member of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>concerned</b> with environmental justice might be involved with making transportation decisions as: A citizen appointed to an environ-mental justice task force or committee; A member of a disempowered group, representing the group’s interests to an advisory committee for the purpose of discussing and influencing transportation policy choices; A member of an advocacy group active in transportation issues; An employee of a non-profit agency that wants to be involved because of the effect that transportation policies have on its constituents; or A resident or business owner affected by a transportation decision. Although {{there is no substitute for}} the knowledge that can be gained over time through experience, this handbook will help those who are new to transportation decision processes influence how environmental justice is incorporated into decisions about transportation policy and projects. Various approaches to environmental justice are discussed, along with steps in the planning process when citizen involvement is particularly effective, suggestions for how environmental justice can be incorporated into a project, and legal requirements for environmental justice...|$|E

Dentre amplos aspectos a serem abordados sobre o tema ?pessoas com defici?ncia?, definiu-se como objetivo geral desta investiga??o, analisar a operacionaliza??o da Pol?tica Estadual de Aten??o ? Pessoa com Defici?ncia do Amazonas coordenada pela Secretaria de Estado dos Direitos da Pessoa com Defici?ncia e como objetivos espec?ficos: Elencar os projetos desenvolvidos pela SEPED, relacionando-os ?s diretrizes da Pol?tica Estadual de Aten??o ?

Na pesquisa de campo foram aplicados dois tipos de formul?rios de entrevistas semi-estruturadas, sendo um para os gestores e outro para os usu?rios da pol?tica. Dentre os resultados da pesquisa, fruto das discuss?es e an?lises apresentadas nos quatro cap?tulos da Disserta??o, sustenta-se que existem a??es espec?ficas voltadas para as pessoas com defici?ncia, fruto de conquistas do segmento na ?rea dos direitos legalmente estabelecidos, dentre as conquistas est?o: a cria??o leis, programas e projetos espec?ficos, como a Lei Brasileira de Inclus?o, o programa Viver sem Limite, a Pol?tica Estadual de Aten??o ?

Conclui-se que a SEPED tem avan?ado na oferta de servi?os para as pessoas com defici?ncia, mas necessita de uma reorganiza??o institucional, de modo que coordena??o das a??es tenha como foco a cria??o estrat?gias de atendimento intersetorial, a fim de garantir a aten??o integral para as demandas do p?blico que atende. The {{discussion on}} topics involving "persons with disabilities" {{is complex and}} challenging for reasons ranging from segregation and exclusion - historically experienced by people with disabilities - to own understanding and definition of the most appropriate term for the population segment. Another aspect that makes the challenging theme and complex refers to the percentage of 32 % {{of the population and}} 23 % of Amazonians who declared with a disability in the Census of 2010, which brings up some questions and reflections, among which: how government has organized {{to meet the demands of}} people with disabilities. Among broad aspects to be addressed on the theme "people with disabilities", defined as general objective of this research, analyze the implementation of the State Care of Persons with Disabilities of coordinated Amazonas Policy by the Secretary of State for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and specific objectives: to name the projects developed by SEPED, relating them to the guidelines of State Policy for Attention to People with Disabilities; Verify how effective the intersectionality between the state departments for implementation of the policy directed to persons with disabilities; Knowing the design of the managers of the State Policy on Care for Persons with Disabilities about the challenges and possibilities for its operation; and identify the vision of the person with disabilities with regard to changes in your life, from its inclusion in the actions developed by SEPED. Was adopted qualitative and quantitative approaches, favoring a qualitative nature, depending on the size of the meanings that respondents attach to the history, facts, people and objects that surround your social universe. In the field research were applied two types of forms of semi-structured interviews, one for managers and one for users of politics. Among the results of the research, the result of discussions and analyzes presented in the four chapters of the thesis, it is argued that there are specific actions for people with disabilities, segment achievements of fruit in the area of legally established rights, among the achievements are: the creating laws, specific programs and projects, such as the Brazilian Law of Inclusion, the no limit Living program, the attention of State Policy for Persons with Disabilities and its own Secretariat which serves exclusively <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>concerned.</b> However, we found that there are still many challenges put to SEPED in the implementation of the state policy process, among the challenges are: a) to fully meeting the needs of people with disabilities, as set out in the political attention axes; b) expansion and strengthening of social control popular participation, in order to ensure the provision of public policy as a citizen's right and duty of the State; c) break with the culture of Rancid "please" and "help" so that public policies start to be intentionally offered as a legal and social rights of citizens. It is concluded that the SEPED has advanced in providing services for people with disabilities, but it needs an institutional reorganization, so that coordination of actions has focused on creating intersectoral assistance strategies in order to ensure full attention to the demands of the public it serves...|$|E
