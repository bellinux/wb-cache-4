50|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{sprockets}} in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One {{of the ways to}} make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance — O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a <b>threaded</b> <b>hub</b> to centre the wheel in the frame. The hub flanges spacing was not shortened on <b>threaded</b> <b>hubs,</b> rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the rear hub flanges were wider apart than those of a <b>threaded</b> <b>hub,</b> so built a stronger wheel with less dish and without the problem of increased bearing stress or axle failure.|$|R
50|$|A {{freewheel}} (also {{known as}} a block) consists of either a single sprocket or a set of sprockets mounted on a body which contains an internal ratcheting mechanism and mounts on a <b>threaded</b> <b>hub.</b> <b>Threaded</b> rear <b>hubs</b> were available in different thread patterns depending on the country of manufacture, French and British threads being the most common. British C.E.I. (Cycle Engineers Institute) thread was adopted as the international standard and {{is now known as}} B.S.C. (British Standard Cycle). It is a standardized right-hand thread (1.375 x 24 TPI) onto which a standard freewheel is screwed. This allows different brands of freewheels to be mounted on different brands of hubs.|$|R
25|$|Usually, {{the rear}} hub {{is the best}} {{component}} on which one can operate chainline adjustments, especially on <b>threaded</b> <b>hubs.</b> If a track hub is used, it’s better to operate on the bottom bracket or - for minor shifts - on the crankset. The same occurs if a flip-flop hub is used, because the chainline {{should be the same}} in both sides (freewheel and fixed gear).|$|R
50|$|The hub {{shell is}} the part of the hub to which the spokes (or disc structure) attach. The hub shell of a spoked wheel {{generally}} has two flanges extending radially outward from the axle. Each flange has holes or slots to which spokes are affixed. Some wheels (like the Full Speed Ahead RD-800) have an additional flange {{in the center of the}} hub. Others (like some from Bontrager and Zipp) do not have a noticeable flange. The spokes still attach to the edge of the hub but not through visible holes. Other wheels (like those from Velomax/Easton) have a <b>threaded</b> <b>hub</b> shell that the spokes thread into.|$|R
50|$|The ISO {{threading}} for freewheels (Single or Multiple Speed) is {{the same}} as for track/fixed cogs. A standard single speed BMX style freewheel can be used on the track <b>threads</b> the <b>hub.</b> Because of the stepped down lock ring threads, not as many threads of the freewheel engage the <b>hub</b> <b>threads</b> as they would if it were threaded to a freewheel threads, however, this is not a problem since the same number of threads are sufficient to secure a track cog. The force applied to a freewheel {{is the same}} as that applied to a fixed cog of the same size, so the missing threads cause no durability issue. Also, there is never any reverse torque on the threads with a freewheel, so a freewheel actually puts less strain on the threads than a fixed cog does.|$|R
2500|$|More recently, large-rotor {{disc brakes}} {{are being used}} as drag brakes. [...] DT-Swiss make an adapter to mate disc rotors with <b>hubs</b> <b>threaded</b> for the Arai drum brake, but this still leaves the problem of fitting the caliper.|$|R
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} {{of the multiple}} sprocket freewheel design is that the drive-side bearing is located inboard of the freewheel, and as sprockets were added over time, moved the bearing farther from the drive-side axle support. This resulted in more flexing stress being placed on the axle, which can bend or even break. Multiple speed freewheels were common on quality high end bikes until the late 1980s. Suntour — Maeda Industries (Japan) introduced a compact 6 speed freewheel which reduced the spacing between the sprockets and was the same width as a standard 5 speed freewheel but required a narrower chain than the standard. The concept was copied by European freewheel manufacturers Regina (Italy) and Maillard (France). As the number of sprockets on a multiple freewheel increased clusters became physically wider, the freehub design overcame the axle/bearing problem with <b>threaded</b> <b>hubs</b> and began to supersede the freewheel design. Today it is rare to find a freewheel on a new bicycle with more than seven speeds. Some new single-speed — especially BMX and utility bikes — and lower-end multi-geared bicycles continue to be manufactured and sold with freewheels.|$|R
5000|$|Track {{sprocket}} - There is no {{mechanism that}} allows the rider to coast. There are two sets of <b>threads</b> on the <b>hub</b> shell. The <b>threads</b> are in opposite directions. The inner (clockwise) set of threads is for a track sprocket and the outer (counter-clockwise) set is for a reverse threaded lock ring. The reverse threads on the lock ring keep the sprocket from unscrewing from the hub, which is otherwise possible when slowing down.|$|R
5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left hand threads {{to accept a}} lockring. The lockring is reverse threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand lockring (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for lock ring compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the <b>threads</b> on the <b>hub</b> to become damaged or destroyed.|$|R
40|$|An uloborid spider (Oclonoba sybotides {{constructs}} {{two types}} of web which are distinguished by linear or spiral stabilimenta. Food-deprived spiders tend to construct webs with spiral stabilimenta and food-satiated spiders tend to construct webs with linear stabilimenta. I experimentally examined the influence of web type on {{the speed of a}} spider's response to small and large flies. The results indicated that web type rather than the spiders' energetic condition influences the response speed to small or large Drosophila flies. I also examined whether thread tension affects the response speed of spiders by increasing the tension of the radial threads. The results showed that spiders on an expanded web responded to small prey as quickly as spiders on webs with spiral stabilimenta. The tension of the radial threads may be regulated by the degree of distortion of the radial <b>threads</b> at the <b>hub.</b> O. sybotides seems to construct orb webs which induce different responses for smaller, less-profitable prey according to its energetic state. The spider appears to increase the tension of the radial threads so that it can sense smaller prey better when hungry...|$|R
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is <b>threaded</b> onto the <b>hub,</b> along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
40|$|Most orb webs are {{vertically}} asymmetric {{with larger}} lower than upper parts, {{even though the}} basic structure of orb webs with concentric sticky spiral loops implies a round shape with the hub in its geometric centre. Spiders are known to modify the basic, round web structure to achieve asymmetric webs by placing the sticky spiral loops eccentrically around the hub and by inserting additional sticky spiral <b>threads</b> below the <b>hub.</b> In addition, spiders could increase asymmetry by building larger meshes below than above the hub. In the present paper, I analyzed these web modifications quantitatively in webs of Araneus diadematus Clerck 1757. In addition, I assessed the influence of gravity on the different web modifications during web building by laying some webs horizontally during auxiliary and/or sticky spiral building, and I also assessed how the web modifications influenced each other during web building. I found that web orientation during auxiliary spiral building influenced auxiliary spiral eccentricity, which in turn influenced sticky spiral eccentricity and overall web asymmetry. Web orientation during sticky spiral building only influenced – together with web asymmetry and spiral ratio – mesh size asymmetry. I conclude that A. diadematus uses the auxiliary spiral as a guiding line during sticky spiral building and that it employs different rules to build the two spirals...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this white {{paper is to}} support {{productive}} and informed conversations {{about the role of}} multidisciplinary efforts at Cal Poly. The paper provides a snapshot summary of various activities and current proposals at Cal Poly, followed by referenced discussions on the question of why promote multidisciplinary education, the problems encountered, and possible organizational models. The paper ends with suggestions for next steps that include: completion of an inventory of existing activities; an analysis of the survey results to find points of convergence and potential opportunities; and creation of a task force, consisting of members who are well-informed of the literature and are interested in program transformation, to develop a strategic vision with goals and conceptual designs. Although the literature on multidisciplinary education is extensive, it is generally focused on case studies and barriers. Nonetheless, this review reveals important lessons worthy of our attention. These are: • Barriers to, and mechanisms for, multidisciplinary education are {{two sides of the same}} coin. • The various forms of multidisciplinary structures, as found in the literature, arise predominately from research-focused institutions. Our Cal Poly mission of teaching with our affiliated fiscal practices must be an acknowledged context when evaluating applicability of these structures. • Multidisciplinary activities are more successful if they also support other institutional priorities, and if there is commitment of leadership. • Multidisciplinary education presents us with a paradox. One must possess disciplinary expertise before one can contribute to, or learn effectively from, the multidisciplinary space. • Matrix organizations may be suitable for organizing multidisciplinary research. • A network of <b>hubs,</b> <b>threads</b> and roles may be best for organizing a multidisciplinary educational approach...|$|R
