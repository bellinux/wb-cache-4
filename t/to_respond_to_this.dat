5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, {{but then in}} electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and eventually pure silver. Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a deterioration in the proportion of precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> crisis by issuing a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E

The government also colossally expanded immigration programmes. <b>To</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> the bank established a Migrant Information Service (later known as the Australian Financial & Migrant Information Service, or AFMIS).

25|$|Some historians {{believe the}} outcome of the trial had been decided in advance by the Committee of Public Safety around the time the Carnation Plot was uncovered.

25|$|It was {{not long}} before major {{corporations}} started taking an interest in computer graphics. TRW, Lockheed-Georgia, General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. Ralph Baer, a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. David C. Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation's computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked {{for the next five years}} as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.|$|E
25|$|On 30 November 2006, the new {{parliament}} was sworn in, including {{several members of}} the then demissionary cabinet. Because of the election results, this House of Representatives had a majority of parties that opposed the course of the third cabinet Balkenende on important issues. One important election issue was an amnesty for a specific group of asylum seekers. This group originally consisted of 26.000 and later 38.000 people who had been in an administrative immigration process since 2001, and many of their children were raised exclusively in the Netherlands. The Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk was looking into each of these dossiers to assess their future: either expulsion or permanent residence. On 1 December, the new House of Representatives adopted a motion to suspend all expulsions of asylum seekers from this group until a final decision on a general amnesty was made. Balkenende reacted annoyed as he stated that this ad hoc left-wing coalition (including PvdA and SP) was not a good basis for negotiations for a stable government. On 5 December, the cabinet declared not to execute this motion for three reasons: first, it claimed that a parliament which deals with a care taker cabinet cannot demand that cabinet to implement new policies; second, it argued that a general amnesty would attract more asylum seeker; third, it raised several questions on what specific groups of asylum seekers should be amnestied and what the legal consequences would be for other groups not included in the amnesty. Minister Verdonk did announce that the expulsion would be suspended until the next parliamentary debate. A majority in the House of Representatives now proposed to stop the expulsion of asylum seekers until formation talks for a new government were finished, and to allow the formation talks to solve this issue. Again, the cabinet refused to execute this motion. On 13 December, the House of Representatives decided <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> unwillingness by a motion of no confidence specifically oriented at Minister Verdonk. The leader of the VVD, Mark Rutte announced that if Minister Verdonk would be forced to leave the cabinet all VVD ministers would leave: leaving only seven CDA ministers in the cabinet. On 14 December, the cabinet held a meeting on how <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> motion: the cabinet found a solution in a portfolio reshuffle between Verdonk and Ernst Hirsch Balin, the Minister of Justice, who became responsible for immigration, while Verdonk became responsible for youth criminality. Hirsh Balin could then partially execute the House of Representatives motion calling for a temporary halt to expulsions, while the VVD could voice its opposition to this decision, breaking the principle that cabinets speak with one voice.|$|E

Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Bahá'ís in the community rose to 4,000 (1,000 children) by 1918 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Bahá'í community was established, with its own hospitals, schools, workshops, newspapers, and a cemetery. This first Bahá'í House of Worship was constructed inside the city of Ashgabat. The design of the building was started in 1902, and the construction was completed in 1908 and was supervised by Vakílu'd-Dawlih, The city's general population was between 44 and 50 thousand at this time.|$|E

500|$|Classical economists had {{difficulty}} explaining involuntary unemployment and recessions because they applied Say's Law {{to the labor}} market and expected that all those willing {{to work at the}} prevailing wage would be employed. In Keynes's model, employment and output are driven by aggregate demand, the sum of consumption and investment. Since consumption remains stable, most fluctuations in aggregate demand stem from investment, which is driven by many factors including expectations, [...] "animal spirits", and interest rates. Keynes argued that fiscal policy could compensate for this volatility. During downturns, government could increase spending to purchase excess goods and employ idle labor. Moreover, a multiplier effect increases the effect of this direct spending since newly employed workers would spend their income, which would percolate through the economy, while firms would invest <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> increase in demand.|$|E

40|$|The complexi ~ of queries in {{relational}} DBMSs is increas-ing {{particularly in}} the decision support area and interactive client server environments. This calls for a more power-ful and flexible optimization of complex queries. In [19] we introduced query rewrite as a distinct query optimiza-tion phase mainly targeted <b>to</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> require-ment. This approach has enabled us to extensively enrich the optimization rides in our system. Further, it has {{made it easier to}} incrementally enrich and adapt the system as need arises. Examples of such query optimizations are predicate pushdown, subquery and magic sets transformations, and decorrelating subqueries. In this paper we describe the de-sign and implementation of a rule engine for query rewrite optimization. Each transformation is implemented as a rule which consists of a pair of rule condition and action [19]. Rules can be grouped into rule classes for higher efficiency, better understandability and more extensibility. The rule engine has a number of novelties in that it supports a full spectrum of control [...] from totally data-driven to totally procedural. Furthermore, it incorporates a budget control scheme for controlling the resources taken for query opti-mization as well as guaranteeing the termination of rule ex-ecution. The rule engine and a suite of query rewrite rules have been implemented in Starburst relational DBMS pro-totype and a significant portion of this technology has been integrated into IBM DB 2 Common Server relational DBMS. ...|$|R
