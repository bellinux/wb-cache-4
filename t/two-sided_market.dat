40|$|The {{award of}} the Nobel Prize in Economics to Professor Jean Tirole in 2014 has {{generated}} intense interest about his brainchild theory of <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> Against this background, this paper explores {{whether there is}} such a thing as a unified theory of <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> and whether the <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> literature can readily be applied by antitrust agencies, regulatory authorities and courts. This paper vindicates caution. The buzz surrounding <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> could mask the fact that, in many cases, the policy implications of the theory are not yet clear, and that divergences among its proponents are often underplayed. In that regard, the paper notably stresses that one of the key conditions of market two-sidedness identified by Rochet and Tirole in their seminal paper of 2003 – the unavailability of Coasian bargaining between both sides of a platform – has often disappeared from subsequent scholarship. This omission threatens the coherent implementation of the theory of <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> Without this qualification, markets are often mischaracterized as two-sided, as soon as they display prima facie signs of indirect network externalities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> are an {{important}} aspect of today’s economies. Yet, the attention they have received in economic theory is limited, mainly due to methodological constraints of conventional approaches: <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> quickly lead to non-trivial dynamics that would require a computational approach, as analytical models quickly become intractable. One approach to this problem is to opt for models that operate on an aggregated level, abstracting from most of the (micro-level) causes of these nontrivial dynamics. Here we revisit a well known equilibrium model by Rochet and Tirole of <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> that has taken this approach. Analyzing the model from an agent-based perspective, however, reveals several inconsistencies and implicit assumptions of the original model. This, together with the highly implausible assumptions that are required to make the model analytically tractable, limits its explanatory power significantly and motivates an alternative approach. The agent-based model we propose allows us to study the phenomenon of <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> in a more realistic and adequate manner: Not only are we able to compare different decision making rules for the providers, we are also able to study situations with more than two providers. Thus, our model represents a first step towards a more realistic and policy-relevant study of <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a floor broker, who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated Market Maker ("DMM") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a <b>two-sided</b> <b>market,</b> making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers.

50|$|Media often {{consists}} of a <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model. In such cases, {{each side of the}} market is expected to provide a form of benefit to the other in return for the same. It is a mutual system of benefit in which there are two end-users or beneficiaries. A lot of times, mass media works in this way (in Canadian society as well as in any other). For example, television requires the viewer and advertisers to provide mutual network benefits. Printed books require the publisher and author to provide readers with quality work; in return, readers provide feedback and increase the popularity of the book through purchases. A newspaper's advertisers and readers mutually benefit from one another; readers provide business for advertisers while advertisers provide readers with information (since a significant portion of newspapers' funding comes from advertisers). The more successful a newspaper is, the better it gets at providing its readers with a well-rounded accumulation of news. All advertising-based media are two-sided markets. Bob Garfield explains that there are two issues with this model: widespread access to certain content has significantly lowered the amount that consumers are willing to spend on it; the audience becomes fragmented. The second issue is that the rise in available content has lowered the prices that advertisers are willing to pay in order to access a portion of the market.|$|E

40|$|App platforms” are {{electronic}} {{software distribution}} platforms for mobile devices like smartphones or tablets. They have gained popularity after Apple launched its App Store in July 2008. Since then, app platforms have transformed the entire mobile communication industry. Although the App Store’s advantage {{seemed to be}} incontestable, other app platforms like Google Play managed to enter the market and achieve high popularity. More platforms followed Apple and Google, trying to create niche markets. This makes the app platform market very dynamic and disruptive. App platforms are not a single example but {{a part of a}} large-scale change. Over the last decade, platforms became the “invisible engines” of our economies (Evans et al., 2006). Amazon, eBay, and Google have advanced to top brands worldwide. Following Gawer and Cusumano (2007), we define platforms as “systems of technologies that combine core components with complementary products and services usually made by a variety of firms. ” Platforms have spread across many industries, leading to creation of new business areas and products. Moreover, they change the whole economic structure and influence business strategies in fundamental ways. Platforms that enable interactions between two groups of customers, which value each other’s presence, are called two-sided markets. <b>Two-sided</b> <b>market</b> models reflect one of the key characteristics of app platforms, namely, the prominent role of indirect network effects. Unfortunately, currently existing <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> models are not suitable to model Internet platforms such as app platforms. Hence, it is necessary {{to come up with an}} appropriate <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model first. Also, a dynamic two-sided model which would be able to reflect dynamic and disruptive nature of two-sided markets is lacking. These are the first two research gaps addressed in the dissertation at hand. The third research gap consists in developing strategies for app platforms based on <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> theory and existing management literature. The objective of this thesis is to address these gaps in three research papers: “An integrated <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model”, “Toward Understanding Dynamics and Disruptions in Two-sided Markets: A Dynamic <b>Two-sided</b> <b>Market</b> Model” and “App Store, Quo Vadis? Challenges and Strategies for App Platforms”. The present thesis is structured as follows: part I includes an introduction to the research field, part II consists of the three stand-alone research papers. The first part begins with introduction to the research project motivation and structure. Background information on the app platform industry and overview of <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> theory follows. Then we provide derivation of research gaps and questions, summaries of the research papers and, finally, general discussion and conclusion. The second part of the dissertation at hand presents the three research papers. All three research papers are based on <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> theory and aim at providing insights for industries based on Internet platforms, in particular, for app platforms. The central objective of the first research paper is to develop a <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model, which can be applied to analyze app platforms. In research paper I, we provide theoretical background and develop an integrated <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model, which includes the most relevant parameters. We also provide a closed-form solution for this model and discuss how it can be used to analyze app platforms. The second research paper builds on the results of the first one and extends it to the dynamic setting. This allows us to go beyond static solution and provide insights regarding strategies in a dynamic and disruptive setting. We consider a range of situations and research questions, for instance, “chicken-and-egg” problem, minimal number of agents necessary to kick-off a platform and external shocks through competitive entry. In the third research paper, we discuss key challenges and central strategic decisions along the life-cycle phases. In addition to the <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> theory, we build on the platform management literature. The third research paper focuses on applying theoretical concepts to derive strategies and suggestions to mitigate challenges faced by app platforms. The integrated <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model with its new parameters and a closed-form solution developed in the research paper I, and introduction of a dynamic <b>two-sided</b> <b>market</b> model in the research paper II, represent main theoretical contributions. Insights regarding strategies for app platforms along the life-cycle stages are crucial from the managerial point of view. The most promising avenues for future research include further development of the models, such as introduction of stochastic parameters, and empirical testing of the models...|$|E

40|$|Various {{economic}} interactions can {{be modeled}} as <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> A central solution concept for these markets is stable matchings, introduced by Gale and Shapley. It {{is well known}} that stable matchings can be computed in polynomial time, but many real-life markets lack a central authority to match agents. In those markets, matchings are formed by actions of self-interested agents. Knuth introduced uncoordinated <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets</b> and showed that the uncoordinated better response dynamics may cycle. However, Roth and Vande Vate showed that the random better response dynamics converges to a stable matching with probability one, but they did not address the question of convergence time. In this paper, we give an exponential lower bound for the convergence time of the random better response dynamics in <b>two-sided</b> <b>markets.</b> We also extend the results for the better response dynamics to the best response dynamics; i. e., we present a cycle of best responses and prove that the r andom best response dynamics converges to a stable matching with probability one, but its convergence time is exponential.
