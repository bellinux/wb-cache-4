5|$|Patton was {{a staunch}} fatalist, and {{believed}} in reincarnation. He believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a military leader {{killed in action}} in Napoleon's army in a previous life, or a Roman legionary.|$|E
5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson {{would have to be}} carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to resort to a siege.|$|E
5|$|Fossett {{took off}} with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, {{according}} to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan, Public Information Officer with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone out for a short flight over favorite territory, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake. At one point it was suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run.|$|E
60|$|And now he sat {{looking at}} the fence, wishing,--wishing;--no, {{certainly}} not wishing that Graham's hurt had been more serious; but wishing that in falling from his horse <b>he</b> <b>might</b> utterly <b>have</b> fallen out of favour with that sweet young female heart; or rather wishing, could he so have expressed it, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had the fall, and the broken bones, and all the danger,--so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> also <b>have</b> had the interest which those eyes and that voice had shown.|$|R
60|$|Lancey {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>have</b> been {{a little}} harsh in expressing himself, and then went off {{to prepare for the}} journey.|$|R
60|$|The Man of Fancy now discerned another guest, {{who stood}} so {{quietly in the}} shadow of one of the pillars <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> easily <b>have</b> been overlooked.|$|R
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) {{at the start}} of the First World War and departed for the Western Front a few weeks later. In February 1915, he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps and soon became No. 2 Squadron's senior observer. In August 1915, while on a photographic reconnaissance mission, his aircraft was shot down in northern France, near Lille. At the time of his death, it was suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the first undergraduate to see action in the war.|$|E
5|$|John Cabot was {{sponsored}} by Henry VII on his voyage in 1497, {{looking for a new}} route to the Orient. Having discovered North America instead, on his return Cabot spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the new land. In 1498 Cabot set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender {{and this has been}} repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
6000|$|She {{spoke in}} so low a voice <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> heard her. At all events, {{abstracted}} by his grand theme, {{he did not}} heed her. He continued,-- ...|$|R
60|$|I have, indeed,' said he, {{simply and}} gravely; {{and there was}} a silence, while she was certain <b>that,</b> {{whatever}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> endured, <b>he</b> did not feel it to have been in vain.|$|R
60|$|Here, <b>he</b> was searched, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> {{about him}} {{the means of}} anticipating the law; this {{ceremony}} performed, they led him {{to one of the}} condemned cells, and left him there--alone.|$|R
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E
5|$|The first {{records of}} Sauvey Castle date around 1216, during the First Barons' War, when the {{government}} of the young Henry III ordered the royal castle to be surrendered to William de Fors, the Count of Aumale. The count established a power base in the region, but in 1218 William Marshal, the regent, ordered him to return it to the Crown; the count declined. Further demands followed until, in 1220, royal forces besieged and took the count's castle at nearby Rockingham. In a face-saving solution, the count finally returned Sauvey to the King, supposedly of his own free will, in exchange for the cancellation of any debts <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> owed to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer and}} former MP Matthew Parris {{described}} Thorpe {{as one of}} the more dashing among the new MPs elected in 1959. Thorpe's chief political interest lay in the field of human rights, and his speeches criticising apartheid in South Africa attracted the attention of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who took note of this rising Liberal star. Thorpe was briefly considered as best man at the 1960 wedding of his Eton contemporary Antony Armstrong-Jones to Princess Margaret, but was rejected when vetting checks indicated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> homosexual tendencies. The security agency MI5, which routinely keeps records on all members of parliament, added this information to Thorpe's file.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] he said, with a laugh. [...] "Who {{would attack}} Colonel Starbottle in <b>that</b> fashion? <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been shot on sight by some {{political}} enemy {{with whom he}} had quarreled--but not BEATEN." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A friend {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>have</b> done so. Indeed, {{it seems}} natural, considering my dear boy's desire {{to enter the}} army, {{and the number of}} soldiers, who are always passing through this town." ...|$|R
60|$|He got {{the name}} of the sign painter, {{accepted}} a glass of buttermilk at the farm house, and then rode slowly home by another route, so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> to face the signs again.|$|R
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about Davies's date of birth. Most records say November 1886, though usually with the caveat <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been born several years earlier. His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies {{and his wife}} Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them with the impression <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US {{was afraid of the}} damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury {{prior to}} his {{becoming}} a bishop. Several historians opine <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{the same as the}} Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead. The evidence is not merely that they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes {{the fact that he was}} felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.|$|E
6000|$|... "How humiliating," [...] said she, [...] "that a great monarch {{should be}} {{dependent}} upon {{one of his}} subjects for permission to do this or <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> all his affairs under his own absolute control!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see I think I did <b>that</b> because <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{jumped off}} if I hadn't been {{up there to}} prevent him--I mean if we had had a smash. I didn't {{want him to get}} out of it." ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. She {{turned her}} head quickly. Her eyes sought his but {{unfortunately}} he was looking straight ahead and seeing gloomy things. If he had happened to turn at <b>that</b> moment, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> concluded his speech differently.|$|R
5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|John {{remained}} Lord of Ireland {{throughout his}} reign. He {{drew on the}} country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased {{the size of his}} lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5000|$|The Independent noted, [...] "This time Taylor's soldiering was {{recognised}} {{with his}} appointment as CBE in July 1955. At <b>that</b> moment <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been counted almost {{the most experienced}} field commander in the world: he was just 50." ...|$|R
60|$|Then the man's apathy and tranquillity vanished, and the voracity {{with which}} he devoured the unaccustomed dainty showed <b>that</b> though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> no demon {{thoughts}} to rack his brain, the vulture in his stomach tortured him as violently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Mr. Prendergast, having ascertained that Mr. Mollett was at {{any rate}} well known at No. 7 Spinny Lane. [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> done so. He is at home at present, I believe?" ...|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{participation}} in the baronial reform movement, Gloucester still maintained {{the trust of the}} king. He, Gaveston and the Earl of Warenne were the only earls to accompany the king on a Scottish campaign in 1310–11. In March 1311, while the Ordinances were still in the workings, Gloucester was appointed guardian of the realm while the king was still in Scotland. There are signs <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> fallen out with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster – who was at this point the leader of the opposition against the king – over a feud between two of their respective retainers. When Gaveston once more returned from exile, however, Gloucester sided with the baronial opposition. The earls divided the country into different parts for defence, and Gloucester was given charge of the south. In June 1312, Gaveston was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who was working in cooperation with Lancaster. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who had the custody of Gaveston and had guaranteed his safety to the king, appealed to Gloucester, as Gaveston's kinsman, for assistance. Gloucester, however, refused to help, and Gaveston was killed. This act brought the country to the brink of civil war, and Gloucester {{was one of the few}} men who was still trusted enough by both sides to be able to take on a role as mediator. In the following months, he was among the main negotiators working towards an agreement between the king and the offending earls, an effort that was at least temporarily successful.|$|E
25|$|McCreery {{regarded}} Montgomery as excessively cautious, {{and indeed}} some historians {{have suggested that}} Montgomery failed to press home his advantage after the Battle of Alamein to the extent <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done (see, for example, Corelli Barnett, The Desert Generals).|$|E
25|$|The site at The Crook Beach, 1 km {{northeast}} of Scar, {{was found in}} 1985 by John Dearness, a farmer on Sanday. He found bones {{sticking out of the}} ground and a small lead object, and thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> discovered the resting place of a dead sailor. Dearness died before the significance of the site was realized.|$|E
60|$|Rowland {{had played}} eavesdropper to so good a purpose <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> justly <b>have</b> omitted the {{ceremony}} of denouncing himself to Roderick. He preferred, however, {{to let him}} know <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had overheard a portion of his talk with Christina.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{if a man}} {{had been}} seated on <b>that</b> stone <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> passed this bridge in safety," [...] said Otter to himself; [...] "yet {{it is one that}} few would care to travel, unless sure death were behind them." ...|$|R
