Touching personal questions like solitude, detachment, and day to day routine, these series of photographs are then the ground for telling not just one story, but rather trigger different meanings and <b>toughts</b> in people who explore them, looking at them as universal questions rather than isolated personal documentation. This classification of photographs being both a mirror and a window to the world ties this project tightly to the contemporary art photography discourse. The series is made sometimes paying homage to some of the important personas of the contemporary photographic practice or following some of the most destinguishable “subgenres”. The overall feel, as well as the style of all the individual photographs, is calm and unintrusive, as opposed to most of the things we are presented to in our life, where being loud is considered {{the only way to get}} heard.

[Something, the tone of mockery, perhaps, suddenly enrages the animal. With a spring he wraps his huge arms around YANK in a murderous hug. There is a crackling snap of crushed ribs--a gasping cry, still mocking, from YANK.] Hey, I didn't say, kiss me. [The gorilla lets the crushed body slip to the floor; stands over it uncertainly, considering; then picks it up, throws it in the cage, shuts the door, and shuffles off menacingly into the darkness at left. A great uproar of frightened chattering and whimpering comes from the other cages. Then YANK moves, groaning, opening his eyes, and there is silence. He mutters painfully.] Say--dey oughter match him--wit Zybszko. He got me, aw right. I'm trou. Even him didn't tink I belonged. [Then, with sudden passionate despair.] Christ, where do I get off at? Where do I fit in? [Checking himself as suddenly.] Aw, what de hell! No squakin', see! No quittin', get me! Croak wit your boots on!

He was educated at Oxford and travelled in England, Scotland and France. On his return his various accomplishments, especially his most excellent vein in poetry, procured him a place at court.

According to Anthony Wood, he could repeat by heart the works {{of most of the}} English poets, especially the poems of John Lydgate, whom he called his master. He was still living in 1521, when it is stated in Henry VIII's household accounts that £6, 13s. 4d. was paid to Mr Hawes for his play, and he died before 1530, when Thomas Field, in his Conversation between a Lover and a Jay, wrote [...] "Yong Steven Hawse, whose soule God pardon, Treated of love so clerkly and well". More recently, some critics, notably C. S.

But his metre is not consistently broken-backed: from time to time (though not very often) one encounters lines that would not have disgraced either Chaucer before him or Spenser after him: [...] "The fragraunt fumes / dyde well encense out // All mysty vapours / of perturbacyon // ore lyker was / her habytacyon // Vnto a place / whiche is celestyall // Than to a terrayne / mancyon fatall" [...] or [...] " [...] By her propre hande / soft as ony sylke // With due obeysaunce / I dyde her than take // Her skynne was whyte / as whalles bone or mylke // My thoughtes was rauysshed / I myght not aslake // My brennynge hert / she the fyre dyde make // These daunces truely / musyke hath me <b>tought</b> // To lute or daunce / but it auayled nought" [...] and so on, where, so long as one pronounces {{at least some of the}} final 'e's, the metre seems to work quite well.|$|E
