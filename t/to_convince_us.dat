Mulroney {{and the government}} pursued an aggressive environmental agenda under the aide of then-environmental policy advisor, present-day Green Party leader Elizabeth May.

In the end Mulroney managed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>U.S.</b> President Ronald Reagan to sign an acid rain treaty, to reduce acid rain.

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>us</b> otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn."

Similarly, Alex Lai from Contactmusic.com commented on the [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sassy" [...] track, saying that it, and the album's fourth single [...] "Take Me on the Floor", [...] "could fill dance floors", but {{he noted that the}} latter made for [...] "stale listening". David James Young, from Sputnikmusic, felt it was the best song on the album, [...] "the best thing about this song is how damn {{infectious}} it is, thus making it an excellent pop song with top harmonies and a synth hook". Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that it [...] "has the kind of breathless, carnivorous sexuality that Madonna still keeps trying <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>us</b> she has", but it wasn't [...] "the sexual awakening that most have been waiting for [...] to have". For its lyrics, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] "sacrifice lyrical clarity {{for the sake of a}} good hook".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>us</b> all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E

[...] Ritkoff expressed that the episode's conclusion was a rational and level-headed resolution to the storyline; [...] "Whatever jealousy he might feel, it would have been absurd for Rick to punish the woman he loves most in the world for post-apocalyptic infidelity under these circumstances." [...] Sepinwall commended Rick's reaction to Lori's confessions, and Goldman felt that their interaction was well acted and perfectly scripted. Venable appraised the segment as [...] "very engaging", and applauded Lincoln's performance. He wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln delivered these lines of pitiable understanding as well as anyone could."

The album {{was released}} with fewer tracks in North America as [...]hack//Game Music Best Collection. Patrick Gann of RPGFan wrote that the second disc, which contains music for cutscenes and special events, was stronger than the first disc's generic town and battle themes. He called the soundtrack [...] "techno meets opera", singled out the volume intro tracks for particular praise. Gann noted that the North American release functions as a [...] "Best of" [...] album, but felt that [...] "a lot of solid music [...] missing" [...] in this release. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic; Paul Koehler of RPGamer called the music [...] "particularly bland" [...] and IGN's Dunham lamented that the second installment did not introduce many new pieces.

[...] VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, {{he was one of the}} [...] "Sexiest Men" [...] of 2010, and 2011. Celia Walden criticised Usher for being overly explicit, remarking [...] "the subject of his own sexual prowess, women and lingerie will obliterate any traditional interview technique." [...] In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating [...] "The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon". In 2013, Complex placed him in its [...] "Most Stylish R Singers of the 90's" [...] list. Men's Health magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue with Lou Schuler calling him [...] "the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry".

500|$|In a later review, Corner {{said that}} [...] "Trouble" [...] was built around [...] "echoing beats and heart-tugging piano riff," [...] which when {{combined}} with [...] "her unmistakable falsetto" [...] was as dramatic as {{a scene from the}} film The Hunger Games. Elena Gorgon from Softpedia echoed earlier sentiments, concluding that the song [...] "was powerful, it's heartfelt and it confirms Leona {{as one of the most}} remarkable vocalists of the day." [...] However MSN's Danielle Cheeseman said that [...] "Trouble" [...] being a safe return to what Lewis has always done wasn't necessarily a good thing. In her review, Cheeseman called the song the [...] "same melodrama" [...] as past Lewis songs and that due to the song sounding familiar to Sandé's song [...] "Daddy", [...] "Lewis has yet to find her own stride". Corner featured [...] "Trouble" [...] on his weekly playlist [...] "10 Songs You Need to Hear" [...] for the week beginning 27 August 2012. There he described elaborated that the song was a welcome return for Lewis thanks to [...] "big beats, big strings and even bigger vocals". Whilst the majority of reviews praised Gambino's appearance on the song, Cheeseman described the collaboration as [...] "a saviour" [...] but that it did nothing for Lewis' [...] "credibility". Her review was subtitled [...] "Leona Lewis Tries <b>to</b> <b>Convince</b> <b>Us</b> She's 'Trouble' — We're not buyin' what she's sellin'" [...] and concluded that if the best that Glassheart could preview after all the delays was [...] "Trouble", [...] "it won't be worth the wait."
