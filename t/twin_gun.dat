5|$|She {{was armed}} with four 12-inch guns {{arranged}} in two <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets, one turret each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of ten 9.2-inch (234mm) guns, eight in <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets on each {{corner of the}} superstructure, and a single gun turret between them. For defence against torpedo boats, Lord Nelson carried twenty-four QF 12-pounder 18 cwt guns and two 3-pounder guns. She also mounted five submerged 18-inch (457mm) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were stowed aboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four BL 12-inch Mk X guns {{arranged}} in two <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of ten BL 9.2-inch Mk XI guns, in <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets on each {{corner of the}} superstructure, and a single gun turret between them, plus 24 QF 12-pounder 18 cwt guns. She also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch (457mm) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were stowed aboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of ten 28 cm SK L/50 guns in five <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets. Her {{secondary}} armament consisted of twelve 15cm SK L/45 guns in casemates in the central portion {{of the ship and}} twelve 8.8cm SK L/45 guns in the bow, in the stern, and around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four 50cm (20in) submerged torpedo tubes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{drawback}} of the Triplane was {{its light}} armament. Contemporary Albatros fighters were armed with two guns but most Triplanes carried one synchronised Vickers machine gun. Efforts to fit <b>twin</b> <b>guns</b> to the Triplane met with mixed results. Clayton & Shuttleworth built six experimental Triplanes with <b>twin</b> <b>guns.</b> Some of these aircraft saw combat service with Nos. 1 and 10 Naval Squadrons in July 1917 but performance was reduced {{and the single}} gun remained standard. Triplanes built by Oakley would have featured <b>twin</b> <b>guns,</b> an engineering change which severely delayed production.|$|R

5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about {{half the cost of}} a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E
5|$|She {{was armed}} with eight 38cm (15in) guns {{arranged}} in four <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets: two superfiring turret pairs {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Baden and her sister Bayern were the first German warships to feature guns of this caliber; earlier battleships carried either 28 or 30.5cm (11 or 12inch) guns. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15cm (5.9in) guns, six 8.8cm (3.45in) guns and five 60cm (23.6in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Upon commissioning, she carried a crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men.|$|E

5|$|The Bayern-class battleships {{were armed}} with a main battery of eight 38cm (15in) SK L/45 guns in four Drh LC/1913 <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets. These turrets could train 150degrees {{to either side of}} the centerline, and their guns could depress to −8degrees. As the Germans thought that {{conditions}} in the North Sea would dictate short-range actions, the guns initially could elevate only to 16degrees, which allowed a maximum range of 20,400m. The gun mountings were modified to allow elevation up to 20degrees, increasing the range to 23,200m.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Helgoland {{received}} four <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets between 1909–12, although their exact type is unknown. Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II {{was built to}} protect the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders during World War I. It consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on Bettungsschiessgerüst (BSG) (firing platforms). These manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount and the rear was supported by rollers resting on a semi-circular rail. They were equipped with a gun shield and capable of all-around fire. They were manned by sailors from Naval Artillery Regiment (Matrosen Artillerie Regiment) 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four /35 caliber guns guns in two <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Wisconsin carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in deck mounted torpedo launchers.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E
5|$|With {{fiscal year}} 1917 appropriations, bids {{on the four}} Colorados were opened on 18 October 1916; though Marylands keel was laid on 24 April 1917, the other three battleships were not until 1919–1920. With the {{cancellation}} of the first , the Colorados were the last U.S. battleships to enter service for nearly two decades. They were also the final U.S. battleships to use <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets—the s and second es had nine 16-inch/45 caliber guns and the s used nine 16in/50 caliber in three triple turrets.|$|E
5|$|In February 1922, {{before the}} Washington Naval Conference concluded, the ship's {{construction}} was suspended {{when she was}} 28 percent complete. She was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier with the hull number CV-3 on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced {{by a total of}} , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406mm) guns in four <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets (including their heavy barbettes, armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, although it was reduced in height to save weight. The hull generally remained unaltered, as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built {{and it would have been}} too expensive to alter them.|$|E

5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E

5|$|The ship carried eight BL 12-inch Mk X guns in four <b>twin</b> <b>gun</b> turrets. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and}} aft on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had a limited ability to fire to the opposite side, but if the ship was full broadside to her target she could bring all eight main guns to bear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4-inch BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.|$|E
