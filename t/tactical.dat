5|$|The F-105D entered {{service with}} the 335th TFS in September 1960, {{although}} it was not fully operational on the F-105D until early 1961. The first overseas F-105 units formed in West Germany in 1961, with the 36th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base in May and the 49th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base in October. Both wings had a primary <b>tactical</b> nuclear strike role for NATO. The F-105D was also deployed to the Pacific, with the 18th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing at Kadena in Okinawa converting in 1962 and the 8th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing converting from 1963.|$|E
5|$|In late October, the 102d {{departed}} Logan for Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, Phalsbourg, France. The wing had 82 Sabres, {{plus two}} C-47 Skytrains and six T-33 Shooting Stars for support and training purposes. During the crisis, the wing controlled the 102d <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Group, the 104th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Group, and the 174th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Group from New York. The 102d's primary {{mission was to}} provide close air support to NATO ground forces, including the Seventh Army, and air interdiction. During the blockade, the 102d did not incur any losses. Starting on 5 December 1961 the 102d began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.|$|E

5|$|The first RAF Phantom {{unit was}} 228 Operational Conversion Unit, which was {{stood up in}} August 1968. The Phantom entered {{operational}} service in May 1969, when 6 Squadron was formed at RAF Coningsby in the <b>tactical</b> strike role. 54 Squadron was formed in September the same year, followed by 41 Squadron in 1972 as a <b>tactical</b> reconnaissance unit. A further four squadrons were formed under RAF Germany in 1970 and 1971: 2, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons, all at RAF Brüggen. Along with their conventional strike role, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons were assigned a <b>tactical</b> nuclear strike role under SACEUR, using weapons supplied by the United States. After initial work-up, 2 Squadron moved to and operated from RAF Laarbruch in the <b>tactical</b> reconnaissance role. The aircraft assigned to the two <b>tactical</b> reconnaissance units were fitted with a pod containing four optical cameras, an infrared linescan and a sideways looking radar.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tactical</b> {{assessment}} {{of both sides}} was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These <b>tactical</b> considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the primary}} roles of the {{regiment}} {{is to provide a}} counter-terrorist capability, with an element of the SASR designated as the <b>Tactical</b> Assault Group (West) to respond to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations. TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal Police <b>Tactical</b> Groups. Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery. A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role. The 2nd Commando Regiment provides <b>Tactical</b> Assault Group (East) to respond to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{undermined}} French military superiority and the Napoleonic image. The Battle of Aspern-Essling was {{the first}} major defeat in Napoleon's career and was warmly greeted by much of Europe. The Austrians had also shown that strategic insight and <b>tactical</b> ability were no longer a French monopoly. The French themselves were actually suffering from <b>tactical</b> shortcomings; the decline in <b>tactical</b> skill of the French infantry led to increasingly heavy columns of foot soldiers eschewing all manoeuvre and relying on sheer weight of numbers to break through, a development best emphasised by MacDonald's attack at Wagram. The Grande Armée lost its qualitative edge partly because raw conscripts replaced many of the veterans of Austerlitz and Jena, eroding <b>tactical</b> flexibility. Additionally, Napoleon's armies were more and more composed of non-French contingents, undermining morale. Although Napoleon manoeuvred with customary brilliance, as evidenced by overturning the awful initial French position, the growing size of his armies stretched even his impressive mental faculties. The scale of warfare grew too large for even Napoleon to fully cope with, a lesson that would be brutally repeated during the invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E

In the single-player campaign, players are restricted by what <b>tactical</b> aid they can use, which can change during a mission.|$|E

25|$|This subgenre of turn-based {{role-playing}} games principally {{refers to}} games which incorporate elements from strategy games {{as an alternative}} to traditional role-playing game (RPG) systems. <b>Tactical</b> RPGs are descendents of traditional strategy games, such as chess, and table-top role-playing and strategic war games, such as Chainmail, which were mainly <b>tactical</b> in their original form. The format of a <b>tactical</b> CRPG is also like a traditional RPG in its appearance, pacing and rule structure. Like standard RPGs, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies. And like other RPGs, death is usually temporary, albeit some have permanent death of party members. But this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as <b>tactical</b> movement on an isometric grid. <b>Tactical</b> RPGs tend not to feature multiplayer play.|$|E
