5|$|My <b>Truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> second studio album by Swedish {{recording}} artist Robyn. It {{was released on}} 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Robyn collaborated with producers including Lindström & Ekhé, Christian Falk, Billy Mann, Thomas Rusiak and Masters at Work during its recording. A pop and R record, My Truth is an autobiographical album for which Robyn co-wrote all fourteen songs. Certain lyrics reflect on the abortion the singer had {{in the fall of}} 1998, which sparked controversy when RCA Records began formulating a North American release. When she refused to make alterations to the album per request by the label, the plans to release My Truth outside of Sweden were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer, a {{judgment}} {{is a combination}} or separation {{of two or more}} concepts. If {{a judgment}} is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. <b>Truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground). Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or formal. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has transcendental truth.|$|E

500|$|The metaphysical groups {{became known}} as the mind-cure {{movement}} because of their strong focus on healing. Medical practice was in its infancy, and patients regularly fared better without it. This provided fertile soil for the mind-cure groups, who argued that sickness was an absence of [...] "right thinking" [...] or failure to connect to Divine Mind. The movement traced its roots in the United States to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802–1866), a New England clockmaker turned mental healer, whose motto was [...] "the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cure." [...] Mary Baker Eddy had been a patient of his, leading to debate about how much of Christian Science was based on his ideas.|$|E

500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E
500|$|Anekantavada is the {{principle}} of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects. Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes {{the world as a}} multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species. [...] It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms. [...] This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and Syadvada is its expression. [...] According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (ekanta) in philosophy.|$|E

VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that [...] "the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>The</b> X-Files has been a show like no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly {{is a place for}} magic and beauty and love on the small screen and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now." [...] Kessenich later named the episode one of the [...] "Top 25 Episode of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, ranking it at number 20.|$|E

50|$|Epicureans reject {{dialectic}} as confusing (parelkousa) {{because for}} the physical philosophers it is sufficient to use the correct words which refer to the concepts of the world.

40|$|Love and <b>truth</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two {{attributes}} of a well-functioning society. Unfortunately, these two basic values are often being devalued {{in the modern}} world.

In this context it <b>is</b> worth analysing <b>the</b> Pope Benedict XVI’s encyclical Caritas in Veritate, in which one should pay attention to a construction of the society in which today’s human person lives.
