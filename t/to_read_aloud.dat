5|$|Twenty years later, Jane, now a {{successful}} author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>aloud,</b> but as Jane rarely does so he remonstrates {{with his daughter}} using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins {{the rest of the}} company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{examined the}} item-level relationship between 7 -year-olds' ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> words <b>aloud</b> and {{their knowledge of}} the same words in the oral domain. Two types of knowledge were contrasted: familiarity with the phonological form of the word (lexical phonology), measured by auditory lexical decision, and semantic knowledge, measured by a definitions task. Overall, there was a robust relationship between word knowledge and <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> success. The association was stronger when words contained irregular spelling-sound correspondences. There was no evidence that a deeper or more semantic knowledge of words was more closely related <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> success beyond the association between reading success and familiarity with the phonological form of the same words. This finding is not compatible with models that see semantics as contributing directly <b>to</b> the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> process, at least during the relatively early stages of reading development. More critical was whether or not a word was considered a lexical item, as indexed by auditory lexical decision performance...|$|R

30|$|Advice on {{punctuating}} English {{will often}} advocate either a syntactic or prosodic approach.

500|$|James M. Redfield, a {{classics}} {{professor at}} the University of Chicago, in his article [...] "An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet" [...] finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's Poetics, with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes {{the outcome of the}} plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet [...] "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is [...] "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> to a child ("This is the mouse..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing [...] "us that teasing is a kind of loving when {{it is a kind of}} teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, teaches us what it is to live in the real world." ...|$|E

Nonetheless, the Duchess was independent-minded, cultured and [...] "the most important person" [...] in her children's lives. At the behest of their mother, Marie and her sisters were taught French, which they detested and rarely ever spoke. Overall, the Duchess neglected her daughters' education, considering them not very bright or gifted. They were permitted <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>aloud,</b> but in the fields of painting and drawing, areas in which they had inherited Queen Victoria's talent, the girls received only a [...] "pedestrian instruction". The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh frequently received {{members of the royal family}} at Eastwell Park, inviting them for breakfast nearly daily and in 1885, Marie and Victoria Melita served as bridesmaids at the wedding of their aunt Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg. Among Marie's playmates were her maternal cousins, Grand Dukes Nicholas (called [...] "Nicky") and George (called [...] "Georgie") and Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia, the other two Russian cousins, Grand Duke Michael (called [...] "Misha") and Grand Duchess Olga being too young for the Edinburgh girls. Other playmates included the children of their maternal uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia.|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{arrived at}} Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to find no boats {{available}} {{to take him}} on to Manaus. Days of inactivity and boredom followed, with [...] "nothing to read except some lives of the Saints in French and Boussuet's sermons". Waugh passed {{some of the time}} by writing a short story; although not identified in the diaries, this story has been generally accepted as [...] "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Apart from using different names and some minor details this story {{is the same as the}} episode that Waugh later used as the climax to A Handful of Dust: an elderly settler (modelled in manner, speech and appearance on Christie), rescues and holds captive a lost explorer and requires him <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> the novels of Dickens, in perpetuity. The story was published in 1933, in America in Hearst's International–Cosmopolitan, and in Britain in Nash's Pall Mall Magazine. In an article written many years later, Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: [...] "The idea [...] came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lonely settler ... and reflecting how easily he could hold me prisoner. Then, after the short story was written and published, the idea kept working in my mind. I wanted to discover how the prisoner got there, and eventually the thing grew into a study of other sorts of savage at home and the civilized man’s helpless plight among them." ...|$|E

500|$|When Congress {{met again}} in December, {{although}} the Judiciary Committee voted 5–4 for impeachment, the House voted against it. On January 13, 1868, the Senate overturned Johnson's suspension of Stanton. [...] Grant resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place. Nevertheless, on February 21, the President ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General Lorenzo Thomas in his place—though Stanton barricaded {{himself in his}} office. These actions caused great excitement in Washington, and in the House of Representatives, Stevens went from group to group on the floor, repeating, [...] "Didn't I tell you so?

[...] Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health {{he was unable to}} complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>aloud.</b> [...] He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government, and of ignoring the will of the people. [...] He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but [...] "this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves."

On these grounds, Pogor fully supported {{only the most}} subversive and eccentric manifestations of Junimist literature. He {{was the only one}} in the group not to approve of poet laureate Vasile Alecsandri. Although he later helped build the Alecsandri monument, he once shouted out that Alecsandri had [...] "a grocer's taste" [...] in art. Instead, Pogor loved the work of peasant storyteller Ion Creangă, and, to the indignation of some other club members, encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> from his erotic literature series, [...] "the corrosives". Later, Pogor welcomed in and shed a spotlight on the cynical, streetwise, humorist Ion Luca Caragiale, who was a passing guest at Junimea. According to Șerban Cioculescu, Pogor differed from Eminescu in that he [...] "freely enjoyed [...] charming spontaneity and temperamental zigzags." [...] Pogor's nonconformism could target even the group's doyen, Maiorescu.
