2500|$|Construction efforts {{included}} clearing 25kilometres {{of previously}} existing track, {{with most of}} the new track constructed by hand using mattocks, shovels and crowbars. [...] Hand built local and imported stone was used for rock steps; put in place by power carriers and <b>Tirfor</b> winches. [...] Elevated steps were built for the steeper terrain. [...] Stepping stones, small rock bridges, and a single timber bridge, were built to cross water areas. Track work has also been performed by volunteers, including Conservation Volunteers Australia, Greencorps, Deakin University, and the regional employment and education Program.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>tirfor</b> and lever block {{effectiveness}} in teak felling {{was conducted at}} the Perum Perhutani (The Forest State Corporation) Unit I Central Java on June 1982 and July 1983. Both felling equipments were used cut the press down to the desired directions. The {{purpose of the study}} is to find out the effects of <b>tirfor</b> and lever block on log damager in felling actives. The study was carried out in a three locations with different slopes i. e. 0 - 10 % and 11 â€“ 30 %. The result indicates that on the 11 - 30 % slope, the <b>tirfor</b> reduces 5. 25 % log damages compared with that of the lever block. It is concluded that in sloped areas <b>tirfor</b> is more efective then lever block...|$|E
5000|$|A {{single point}} or single buoy mooring {{system is a}} {{facility}} for loading and unloading petroleum products to tankers, which moor to them only by the bow. One or two flexible hoses are used to transfer the products between the pipeline and tanker. A SPM {{may be used in}} deep water to take oil from the oilfield via a production platform, an in shallow water to export or import crude oil or oil products from an oilfield or refinery, usually by way of a storage facility. A range of single point mooring configurations are in use, and installation, maintenance and inspection work on all types is commonly done by divers. The work may include placing the pipeline end manifold (PLEM) and connecting it to the submarine pipelines, installing anchor chains and checking and adjusting chain angles, installing the submarine hoses between the PLEM and the buoy, installing a ships mooring system and operating subsea valves. The work is likely to involve the use of winches and cranes, rigging, including use of <b>tirfors,</b> chain hoists, strops and spreaders, flanging, using wrenches, hammers and gaskets, oxy-arc burning and welding.|$|R
