40|$|Radioactive ion-beams {{produced}} from various uranium and thorium targets at the ISOLDE mass separator facility are presented. The targets are bombarded with 1 GeV protons {{delivered by the}} PS-Booster at CERN. The target materials are uranium carbide and <b>thorium</b> <b>carbide,</b> both prepared from the oxides or diphtalocyanines of uranium and thorium. Due to the pulsed structure of the PS-Booster, release can be measured {{as a function of}} time for a number of elements. Beam intensities and delay time distributions of the alkali-metals, the earth-alkalis, the boron group and the noble gases measured from the described targets are discussed, Comparisons are made between the target materials and with ISOLDE beam intensities produced by 600 MeV protons from the CERN synchrocyclotron. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|There {{are more}} than 250 forms of US Department of Energy (DOE) -owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Due to the variety of the spent nuclear fuel, the National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program has {{designated}} nine representative fuel groups for disposal criticality analyses based on fuel matrix, primary fissile isotope, and enrichment. The Fort Saint Vrain reactor (FSVR) SNF has been designated as the representative fuel for the Th/U carbide fuel group. The FSVR SNF consists of small particles (spheres {{of the order of}} 0. 5 -mm diameter) of <b>thorium</b> <b>carbide</b> or thorium and high-enriched uranium carbide mixture, coated with multiple, thin layers of pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide, which serve as miniature pressure vessels to contain fission products and the U/Th carbide matrix. The coated particles are bound in a carbonized matrix, which forms fuel rods or ''compacts'' that are loaded into large hexagonal graphite prisms. The graphite prisms (or blocks) are the physical forms that are handled in reactor loading and unloading operations, and which will be loaded into the DOE standardized SNF canisters. The results of the analyses performed will be used to develop waste acceptance criteria. The items that are important to criticality control are identified based on the analysis needs and result sensitivities. Prior to acceptance to fuel from the Th/U carbide fuel group for disposal, the important items for the fuel types that are being considered for disposal under the Th/U carbide fuel group must be demonstrated to satisfy the conditions determined in this report...|$|E
25|$|Three binary thorium borides are known: ThB6, ThB4, and ThB12. The last is isotypic with UB12. While {{reports of}} ThB66 and ThB76 exist, they {{may simply be}} thorium-stabilised boron allotropes. ThB6 and ThB12 may be {{produced}} by heating thorium with boron. The three known binary <b>thorium</b> <b>carbides</b> are ThC2, Th2C3, and ThC: all are produced by reacting thorium or thoria with carbon. ThC and ThC2 are refractory solids and have melting points over 2600°C. <b>Thorium</b> borides, <b>carbides,</b> silicides, and nitrates are refractory materials, as are those of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels.|$|R

All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this analysis, as {{directed}} by ''Technical Work Plan for: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]), is to compile applicable corrosion data from the literature (journal articles, engineering documents, materials handbooks, or standards, and national laboratory reports), evaluate the quality of these data, and use these to perform statistical analyses and distributions for aqueous corrosion rates of waste package materials. The {{purpose of this}} report is not to describe the performance of engineered barriers for the TSPA-LA. Instead, the analysis provides simple statistics on aqueous corrosion rates of steels and alloys. These rates are limited by various aqueous parameters such as temperature (up to 100 C), water type (i. e., fresh versus saline), and pH. Corrosion data of materials at pH extremes (below 4 and above 9) {{are not included in}} this analysis, as materials commonly display different corrosion behaviors under these conditions. The exception is highly corrosion-resistant materials (Inconel Alloys) for which rate data from corrosion tests at a pH of approximately 3 were included. The waste package materials investigated are those from the long and short 5 -DHLW waste packages, 2 -MCO/ 2 -DHLW waste package, and the 21 -PWR commercial waste package. This analysis also contains rate data for some of the materials present inside the fuel canisters for the following fuel types: U-Mo (Fermi U- 10 %Mo), MOX (FFTF), <b>Thorium</b> <b>Carbide</b> and Th/U Carbide (Fort Saint Vrain [FSVR]), Th/U Oxide (Shippingport LWBR), U-metal (N Reactor), Intact U-Oxide (Shippingport PWR, Commercial), aluminum-based, and U-Zr-H (TRIGA). Analysis of corrosion rates for Alloy 22, spent nuclear fuel, defense high level waste (DHLW) glass, and Titanium Grade 7 can be found in other analysis or model reports...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Laser {{ionization}} of AnC 4 alloys (An = Th, U) yielded gas-phase molecular <b>thorium</b> and uranium <b>carbide</b> cluster cations {{of composition}} AnmCn +, with m = 1, n = 2 − 14, and m = 2, n = 3 − 18, as detected by Fourier transform ion-cyclotron-resonance mass spectrometry. In {{the case of}} thorium, ThmCn + cluster ions with m = 3 − 13 and n = 5 − 30 were also produced, with an intriguing high intensity of Th 13 Cn + cations. The AnC 13 + ions also exhibited an unexpectedly high abundance, {{in contrast to the}} gradual decrease in the intensity of other AnCn + ions with increasing values of n. High abundances of AnC 2 + and AnC 4 + ions are consistent with enhanced stability due to strong metal−C 2 bonds. Amon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} and composition of planets, small bodies of the Solar system is essentially different. Therefore {{it is difficult to}} explain an origin of all celestial bodies of the Solar system due to smooth evolution of the protoplanet cloud. An alternative to the evolutionary one is the hypothesis of the explosive origin of some celestial bodies. It is supposed, that on the solid inner core of a planet the active layer is formed from particles of uranium and <b>thorium</b> oxides (or <b>carbides),</b> weighed in liquid iron of the outer core of the planet. The explosion in such a layer might take place at fast and deep transition of the system in a supercritical condition, for example as a result of collision of a planet with an asteroid. Collision of the protoplanet with an asteroid, the subsequent explosion in an active layer and partial or full fragmentation of the planet in conditions of gravitation is numerically simulated. Modeling was conducted within the framework of hydrodynamical approach for two-dimensional non-stationary motion of the compressible medium on the basis of laws of conservation of mass, pulse and energy in cases of plane and axial symmetry. The hypothesis that some bodies of the Solar system might be formed as a result of nuclear explosions in the protoplanet core, including large enough fragments mainly iron-nickel, stone-silicate or dust-ice structure is numerically confirmed in the paper. It explains distinctions in {{structure and}} characteristics of satellites of some planets, asteroids and comets. Formation of small celestial bodies due to the explosion is possible a...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} several specific knowledge gaps {{that exist}} in the use of alternative fuel and cladding combinations in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) environment. In the switch from a UO 2 with zirconium-based cladding to any other combination, there is a multitude of questions that need to be answered. This work examines three of these knowledge gaps: (1) the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium in <b>thorium</b> and silicon <b>carbide</b> cladding, (2) economics of accident tolerant fuel (ATF) claddings and (3) breeding of plutonium in uranium nitride fuel. Burning weapons-grade plutonium in a standard pressurized water reactor (PWR) using thoria as a fuel matrix has been compared to using urania. Two cladding options were considered: a 0. 76 mm thick silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite (SiC CMC) and 0. 57 mm thick standard Zircaloy cladding. A large benefit was found in using thoria compared to urania in terms of plutonium percentage and mass burned. A slightly smaller mass of plutonium is required in a core with SiC CMC cladding, due to its lower neutron absorption compared to Zircaloy. The thorium system was also better from a non-proliferation viewpoint, resulting in less fissile mass at discharge and more fissile mass burned over an assembly's lifetime. A limited safety comparison was made for two reactivity insertion accidents: (1) highest worth rod ejection accident (REA) and (2) main steam line break (MSLB). The MSLB accident demonstrated a safe value for the minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio. The maximum enthalpy added to the fuel during the REA was also below current regulatory limits for PWRs. This indicates that the more negative moderator temperature coefficients of thoria-plutonia and urania-plutonia fuel, compared to a typical PWR design, were not limiting. For an ATF cladding to replace zirconium alloys, it must be economically viable by having similar fuel cycle costs to today's materials. Four proposed materials are examined: stainless steel (SS), FeCrAl alloy, molybdenum (Mo) and SiC CMC, each having its own development time and costs. The chosen cladding thicknesses were dependent on strength and manufacturing constraints. It was found that all options may end up requiring higher enrichment than zirconium-based claddings for the same fuel cycle length. If the present value of avoiding a reactor accident with a large radioactivity release is estimated using past experience for LWR large accidents and if it is assumed that ATF cladding is able to prevent such release, there is a definite net economic benefit relative to typical Zircaloy cladding only in using SiC, since it only results in a small fuel cycle cost increase. There is only a marginal benefit in using SiC to prevent a core-only loss without radioactivity release (TMI-type) accident and a large loss using metallic ATF concepts. The thermal hydraulic and neutronic feasibility of a nitride fueled pressurized water reactor (PWR) breeder design were examined. Because of its higher fuel density, nitride fuel would be preferable to traditional oxide fuel in attempting to achieve breeding in a PWR. The design chosen uses large hexagonal assemblies with 14 inner seed pin rows and 4 outer blanket pin rows. In this design, reactor grade plutonium of 12. 75 wtHM was used as fuel. Nitride was also simulated as being 100 % N- 15, to limit neutronic penalties and C- 14 production. The as specified assembly model only achieved a fissile inventory ratio (FIR) value above 1. 0 when the thimble regions were assumed to be voided, which lowers the H/HM ratio in the assembly. This led to FIR values above 1. 0 for the oxide, 85 % theoretical density nitride (N 85) and 95 % theoretical density nitride (N 95). All were at an FIR of 1. 03 at 35 MWd/kgHM. However, the single batch discharge burnup of the voided assembly in MWd/kgHM was 32. 2 for N 95, 24. 5 for N 85, while only 15. 6 for the oxide. by Nathan Christopher Andrews. Thesis: Ph.
