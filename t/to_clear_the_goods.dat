This {{means that the}} buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} income and wealth inequality in a Kaldorian model where the profit share adjusts <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market and the long-run output-capital ratio is constant. The approach is radically different from both the mainstream approach that stresses properties of production function and the Kaleckian approach that emphasizes the long-run adjustment of utilization. The Kaldorian model is used to identify several developments that may have caused increasing inequality in income and wealth since the early 1980 s, including the shift of the power relation in corporate firms in favor of top managerial pay, {{the decline in the}} retention rate, increasing share buybacks, rising indebtedness of lower-income households, and the stock market boom in the 1990 s. In contrast to Piketty 2 ̆ 7 s explanation, the decline in the natural rate of growth reduces inequality of income and wealth in this Kaldorian framework...|$|E
40|$|As global trading intensifies, {{more and}} more {{businesses}} are finding cheaper and efficient ways to source raw materials and finished products. They have also started re-evaluating their business strategies and are relocating their manufacturing sectors to countries that provide abundant resources at low costs {{in the hope of}} attaining competitive advantage. Countries with emerging economies have recognised the opportunity and are directing their developments towards the overall infrastructure to accommodate the potential growth of demands for inward logistics. However, problems do come up during the process. The objective of this research was to gain an understanding of the role that the inward logistics played in international trade. The analysis was focused on developing countries, taking Nigeria as a case study. Logistics is divided into two, inbound (or inward) and outbound logistics. Inward logistics essentially means the when flow of goods, people or information is directed towards the interior. It encompasses transportation, warehousing, inventory management, production and procurement. Inward logistics has become a major source of competitive advantage and global trade has been responsible for its boosts. Previous researches have associated inward logistics to the production process. According to them, inward logistics is the flow of goods such as components, sub-assemblies and raw materials into the manufacturing plants. However, this research would bring in a new perception. Inward logistics does not only imply the flow of goods and information towards the manufacturing plant but can also be towards retailers, warehouses, distribution centres or even to the end consumers. To understand the process of inward logistic within a country, Picard’s 1983 and Schary and Skjett in 2001 model on global distribution is illustrated. Both the models focused on the role that the transportation played while bringing into a country and distributing it within the region. It involves freight forwarder or logistics provider, local transport and carrier. Nigeria is the 12 th largest producer of oil which makes up 85 % of the country’s exports and 95 % of its revenue. However, despite this almost 50 % {{of the population of the}} country remains poor. The transport infrastructure, since the 1970 remains fractured as a result of corruption at every level of the government. This is just one of the many countries with emerging economies that struggle to build and maintain an efficient logistics system. For the primary analysis, in depth interviews were conducted with the objective of obtaining an original piece of work on the constraints on inward logistics from a business perspective. The managers from the operations departments of five companies were taken for the analysis. These companies belong to the automobile, textile, agriculture and express delivery industry. The interview was split into two parts; the first was related to the processes of bringing in goods into the country using marine ports. In Nigeria, the standard importation process is followed except for few slight variations. It is required by law to have an account at a local bank which will be responsible for all the transactions taking place between the exporter and the receiver. Also, inspections agencies are used to inspect the documents and the goods being brought into the country to ensure safety and usability. These agencies differ according to the goods. Almost all the companies complained about the customs process and the procedure of clearing the goods. Due to corruption, delays were made intentionally with the excuse of either the presentation of wrong documents or wrong duty evaluation. Other issues included lack of container handling equipments, under developed links to the ports etc. The main cause for this problem is the deficient investment for its expansion and update. Up till now, no efforts have been made to address the issue. For some companies, about 7 - 8 % profit margin would have to be kept for the purpose of informal payment in order <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> quickly. The second part of the analysis focused on the companies’ distribution system and the issues they face when delivering the units within the country. Some of the problems highlighted were bad roads, highway robberies and non-unionisation of interstate custom documents. Companies have had to adapt to these situations. For example, all the companies have had to send armed escorts along with the consignments due to the high risks of theft. And while efforts are being made by the government to address the issues, they have been restrictive and inconsistent. To conclude, while it is essential for every country to have an efficient logistics, it can at times be quite difficult to reach up to that level and while certain rules and format set by the developed countries is related to achieving it, it cannot be applied to every country...|$|E

50|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1962 {{it was decided to}} close the branch, the reason being that the timber swing bridge which crossed Langstone Harbour needed to be replaced. The line was {{operating}} at a small profit at this time but despite protests British Railways took the view that the cost of a new bridge was an unreasonably large investment. The final normal service train ran on the evening of 2 November 1963. Goods services continued until the final day but goods trains were not run separately. Instead goods were conveyed in mixed trains (passenger coaches, goods wagons and vans, and a brake van) and these were a feature of the branch until <b>the</b> end. <b>To</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>goods</b> stock away, <b>the</b> final train from Hayling Island on Saturday 2 November 1963 was a mixed train hauled by A1X no. 32650.

40|$|We {{study the}} Fisher {{model of a}} {{competitive}} market from the algorithmic perspective. For that, the related convex optimization problem due to Gale and Eisenberg, [8], is used. The latter problem is known to yield a Fisher equilibrium under some structural assumptions on consumers’ utilities, e. g. homogeneity of degree 1, homotheticity etc. Our goal {{is to examine the}} applicability of the convex optimization framework by departing from these traditional assumptions. We just assume the concavity of consumers’ utility functions. For this case we suggest a novel concept of Fisher-Gale equilibrium by introducing consumers’ utility prices. The prices of utility transfer the utility of a consumption bundle to a common numéraire. We develop a subgradient-type algorithm from Convex Analysis to compute a Fisher-Gale equilibrium. In order to decentralize prices, we additionally implement the auction design, i. e. consumers settle and update their individual prices and producers sell at the highest offer price. Our price adjustment is based on a tâtonnement procedure, i. e. the prices change proportionally to consumers’ individual excess supplies. Historical averages of consumption are shown <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> market of <b>goods.</b> Our algorithm enjoys a convergence rate. In worst case, the number of price updates needed to achieve the ε-tolerance is proportional to 1 /E^ 2...|$|R
