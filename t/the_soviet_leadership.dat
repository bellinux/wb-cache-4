5|$|After the {{reshuffling}} {{process of}} the Politburo ended in the mid-to-late 1970, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> evolved into a gerontocracy, a form of rule in which the rulers are significantly older {{than most of the}} adult population.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{protected}} János Kádár's {{economic reforms}} and {{his position as}} leader of the People's Republic of Hungary from intervention by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership.</b> Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalise the economy of the People's Republic of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since it was trying to reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy programme in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. During the discussions within <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> of a possible Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia Kosygin reminded leaders of the consequences of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. Kosygin's stance became more aggressive later on when he understood that the reforms in Czechoslovakia could be turned against his 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, {{continued}} to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> in harsh terms. Indirect {{conflict between the}} superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola.|$|E

5|$|In late 1979 Taraki {{failed to}} assassinate Amin, who, in a revenge attack, {{successfully}} engineering Taraki's own assassination on 9 October. Later, in December, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan {{at the behest}} of Khan. On 27 December a KGB unit killed Amin. Babrak Karmal, the leader of the Parcham faction, was chosen by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> as Amin's successor {{in the aftermath of the}} Soviet intervention. Unfortunately for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> Karmal did not turn out to be the leader they expected, and he, just as his predecessors had arrested and killed several Parcham-members, arrested and killed several high-standing and low-standing Khalq members simply because they supported the wrong faction. With Soviet troops still in the country, however, he was forced to bow to Soviet pressure, and released all Khalq prisoners. To make matters even worse for Karmal several of the previously arrested Khalq-members were forced to join the new government. At the time of Brezhnev's death, the Soviet Union was still bogged down in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna came {{to be seen as a}} prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) {{just as he}} had previously {{approved the}} Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would not suffer by a possible leadership reshuffling by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would spark a succession crisis, and so they helped to maintain the status quo.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership's</b> {{preference}} for uncomplicated moral {{themes in the}} arts was demonstrated in Yuri Grigorovich's appointment as director in 1964. Grigorovich held his position until 1995, at which point a series of directors, including Boris Akimov, Alexei Ratmansky, Yuri Burlaka and Sergei Filin, brought to the company more modern ideas about dance performance.|$|R
50|$|Collectivization {{throughout}} Moldova was not aggressively pursued {{until the}} early 1960s because of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership's</b> focus on a policy of Russification of Moldavians into the Russian way of life. Much of the collectivization in Moldova had undergone in Transnistria, in Chişinău, the present-day capital city of Moldova. Most of the directors who regulated and conducted the process of collectivization were placed by officials from Moscow.|$|R
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko {{was seen as the}} most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Podgorny {{became a}} member of the Politburo (Political Bureau) and by 1963 had risen to {{prominence}} within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As a protégé and close companion of Nikita Khrushchev, he travelled with him to United Nations headquarters in 1960. He acted as a Soviet emissary to Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Canada, and Yugoslavia. Podgorny's beliefs were strongly influenced by Khrushchev, and under Leonid Brezhnev's rule, Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership,</b> even more liberal than Premier Alexei Kosygin.|$|E
500|$|Détente, {{literally}} the easing of strained relations, or in Russian [...] "unloading", characterized {{the early part}} of the era. It meant [...] "ideological co-existence" [...] in <b>the</b> context of <b>Soviet</b> foreign policy, but it did not, however, entail an end to competition between capitalist and communist societies. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership's</b> policy did, however, help to ease <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's strained relations with the United States. Several arms control and trade agreements were signed and ratified in this time period.|$|R
50|$|Translations {{of foreign}} {{publications}} were often produced in a truncated form, accompanied with extensive corrective footnotes. E.g. in the Russian 1976 translation of Basil Liddell Hart's History of the Second World War pre-war purges of Red Army officers, secret protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, many {{details of the}} Winter War, occupation of Baltic states, Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Allied assistance to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union during <b>the</b> war, many other Western Allies' efforts, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership's</b> mistakes and failures, criticism of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and other content were censored out.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Operation Barbarossa, the German {{attack on}} the USSR, the German Air Force did carry out an {{extensive}} pre-strike aerial observation of European Russia. This was possible partly because Soviet air opposition was weak, and because of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership’s</b> conviction that Germany would not attack. The Luftwaffe maintained air superiority in the East {{until late in the}} war, but simply could not bring enough resources to bear for air power to be decisive.|$|R
5|$|On 25 August 1980 the Soviet Politburo {{established}} a commission chaired by Mikhail Suslov {{to examine the}} political crisis in Poland that was beginning to gain speed. The importance of the commission was demonstrated by its composition: Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Yuri Andropov (KGB Chairman) and Konstantin Chernenko, the Head of the General Department of the Central Committee and Brezhnev's closest associate. After just three days, the commission proposed {{the possibility of a}} Soviet military intervention, among other concrete measures. Troops and tank divisions were moved to the Soviet–Polish border. Later, however, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> {{came to the conclusion that}} they should not intervene in Poland. Stanisław Kania, the First Secretary of the PUWP, mooted the Soviet proposal for introducing martial law in Poland. Erich Honecker, the First Secretary of the East German Socialist Unity Party, supported the decision of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership,</b> and sent a letter to Brezhnev and called for a meeting of the Eastern Bloc leaders to discuss the situation in Poland. When the leaders met at the Kremlin later that year, Brezhnev had concluded that it would be better to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone for the time being, reassuring the Polish delegation, headed by Kania, that the USSR would intervene only if asked to.|$|E
5|$|These policy failures, and the {{stalemate}} that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> to become {{highly critical of}} Karmal's leadership. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to Moscow. He was {{allowed to return to}} Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party and Government apparatus, his disregard for Party and Government institutions, and his one-man domineering leadership style. The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had grown tired of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> also believed that his individualistic leadership style ran contrary to the ideal collective leadership. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given prominence in the new leadership. Together they formed a functional collective leadership.|$|E

5|$|Born {{in rural}} Russia in 1902, Suslov {{became a member}} of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied {{economics}} for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression begun by Joseph Stalin's regime. Suslov impressed <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> to such an extent in the pre-Eastern Front Soviet Union that he was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He {{became a member of}} the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946 and, four years later, was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the All-Union Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Khrushchev's {{fall from}} power {{two years later}} was {{in part because of}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's {{eventual}} concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.

50|$|Many {{works of}} Western historians were {{forbidden}} or censored, {{many areas of}} history were also forbidden for research as, officially, they never happened. Translations of foreign historiography were often produced in a truncated form, accompanied with extensive censorship and corrective footnotes.

The decline in the Central Committee's standing began in the 1920s, and it {{was reduced to a}} compliant body of the Party leadership during the Great Purge. According to party rules, the Central Committee was to convene at least twice a year to discuss political matters (but not matters relating to military policy).|$|R
5|$|During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Suslov, {{along with}} Anastas Mikoyan, {{operated}} {{in close proximity}} to Budapest in order to direct the activities of the Soviet troops and to lend assistance to the new Hungarian leadership. Suslov and Mikoyan attended the Politburo meeting of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party which elected János Kádár to the General Secretaryship. In a telegram to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership,</b> Suslov and Mikoyan acknowledged that the situation had become more dire, but both were content with the dismissal of Ernő Gerő as General Secretary and the choice of Kádár as his successor. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet criticised Suslov's and Mikoyan's concessions to the new revolutionary government in the People's Republic of Hungary. Despite his initial reservations, Suslov eventually supported the Presidium's decision to intervene in Hungary militarily and replace the counterrevolutionary government's leadership there.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the German {{leadership}} began {{preparing for}} Operation Citadel, {{with the objective}} of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the Steppe Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the Steppe Front.|$|E
5|$|Other {{options were}} explored, {{including}} the Kalmyk Project, a Soviet plan {{to launch a}} surprise attack on the north-west frontier of India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states such as Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Thailand, and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyk people. The intention was to use these places as a staging ground for revolution in India, as they offered the shortest route to the revolutionary heartland of Bengal. Historians suggest that the plan may have been prompted by Mahendra Pratap's efforts and advice to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership</b> in 1919 when—along with other Indian revolutionaries—he pressed for a joint Soviet-Afghan campaign into India. Under {{the cover of a}} scientific expedition to Tibet headed by Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, the plan was to arm the indigenous people in the North-East Indian region with modern weaponry. The project had the approval of Lenin.|$|E
500|$|All self-proclaimed African socialist {{states and}} the Middle Eastern country of South Yemen were {{labelled}} by Soviet ideologists as [...] "States of Socialist Orientation".

According to historian Archie Brown, these Soviet ideologists were correct, and, as a result no true socialist states were ever established in Africa, though Mozambique certainly came close.|$|R

50|$|The {{events of}} April 9 also {{gave rise to}} the {{so-called}} 'Tbilisi Syndrome'. This syndrome was characterized by the reluctance of military officers and soldiers to take any tactical decisions or even obey orders without a clear trail of responsibility to a higher authority. It arose because of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leadership's</b> refusal {{to take responsibility for the}} orders to clear the square and the commission report's and Shevardnadze's criticism of the military in general. 'Tbilisi Syndrome' continued to spread in the coming years, especially following events in Baku and Vilnius, and contributed in 1991 to the refusal of soldiers to prevent demonstrations during the August 1991 putsch.|$|R
