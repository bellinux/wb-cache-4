5|$|Theobald was {{instrumental}} in securing <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the Welsh bishoprics to Canterbury. His first act in this area was the consecration of Meurig as Bishop of Bangor in 1140, during which Meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to Canterbury. Bernard, Bishop of St David's, contested Theobald's right to consecrate Meurig and instead asserted that St David's should be considered an archbishopric, and that Bernard should receive a pallium. This went against the last half-century of precedent that Canterbury had jurisdiction over the four Welsh sees, a precedent that dated back to Anselm's days when Anselm had consecrated Urban as Bishop of Llandaff in 1107.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} had {{an effect}} on democratization movements in such countries as Taiwan and South Korea; other effects include the restoration of the freedom of the press, abolition of repressive laws under a dictator's regime, adoption of a new constitution, and <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the military to civilian rule, despite several coup attempts during the Aquino administration.|$|E
25|$|In the Imperial era, a {{perceived}} increase in passive homosexual behavior among free males {{was associated with}} anxieties about <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> political liberty to the emperor, and led {{to an increase in}} executions and corporal punishment. The sexual license and decadence under the empire was seen as a contributing factor and symptom of the loss of the ideals of physical integrity (libertas) under the Republic.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{suffered}} persecution in Nazi Germany. As {{a totalitarian}} ideology, the Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, interfering with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies. Nazi ideology {{could not accept}} an autonomous establishment, whose legitimacy did not spring from the government. It desired <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the church to the state. The Nazi leadership hoped to dechristianise Germany in the long term.|$|E
25|$|By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was {{a patriarchal}} society that subordinated women to men, {{and the young}} to their elders. Peter the great relaxed the second custom, but not <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> women. A decree of 1722 {{explicitly}} forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter's reign, only the man could get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels {{had been}} a student of Jesuits, and Heinrich Himmler was {{impressed}} by the Order's organisational structure. Hitler wrote favourably of their influence on architecture and on himself in Mein Kampf. But Nazi ideology could not accept an autonomous establishment whose legitimacy did not spring from the government and it desired <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the church to the State. According to historians Kershaw, Bullock, Evans, Fest, Phayer, Shirer and others, Hitler eventually hoped to eradicate Christianity in Germany.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the coins}} issued by any state have always {{reflected}} {{the current political}} or economic situation. Many ancient and pre-modern coins certainly commemorate events in contemporary times. For instance, Roman coins often have references to military campaigns and the defeat of foreign powers. These reverse types often symbolically represent <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> recently conquered territories to Roman authority. Such coins are examples of ancient political propaganda. The Roman Empire may be represented by a proud warrior 'raising' an undersized figure, representing the defeated enemy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the {{city-state}} of Athens recently had perdured the trials and tribulations of Spartan hegemony, the thirteen-month régime of the Thirty Tyrants, imposed consequent to the Athenian defeat in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). At the request of the pro–Sparta Lysander, a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by Critias and Theramenes, were installed to govern Athens, and to revise the city’s democratic laws, which were inscribed to a wall of the Stoa Basileios; their political actions meant to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> Athenian government — from democracy to oligarchy — in service to Sparta.|$|E
25|$|Knowles {{was briefly}} Member of Parliament for Gatton between 1749 and 1752, and in 1752 he was {{appointed}} Governor of Jamaica. Over his four-year period as governor he took steps to reform the legal system, and also moved the administrative capital from Spanish Town to Kingston, arguing that the latter was more defensible. His attempts to ensure <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the Jamaican assembly to the British government led to calls for his removal as governor, but his policies were subsequently upheld by the British government. Knowles resigned the governorship in January 1756 and returned to England. He had been promoted to vice-admiral of the red on 4 February 1755.|$|E

25|$|The decade between 941 and 951 {{was marked}} by Otto's {{exercise}} of undisputed domestic power. Through <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the dukes under his authority, Otto asserted his power to make decisions without their prior agreement. He deliberately ignored the claims and ranks of the nobility, who wanted dynastic succession in the assignment of office, by freely appointing individuals of his choice to the kingdom's offices. Loyalty to Otto, not lineage, was the pathway towards advancement under his rule. His mother Matilda disapproved of this policy and was accused by Otto's royal advisers of undermining his authority. After Otto briefly exiled her to her Westphalian manors at Enger in 947, Matilda was brought back to court {{at the urging of}} his wife Eadgyth.|$|E
25|$|Neither Robertson nor Derby {{were invited}} to the War Cabinet on 24 February (no minutes were circulated, but on the train to Calais Hankey was {{instructed}} {{to draw up a}} summary to be circulated after the conference), at which ministers felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves to be more skilful than the British, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war. Hankey also told Stamfordham that on the train to Calais Lloyd George had informed Robertson and Maurice that he had the authority of the War Cabinet “to decide specifically between Generals Haig & Nivelle”, although <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> Haig to Nivelle had not been specifically discussed.|$|E
25|$|For the Germans, the Battle of Mons was a {{tactical}} repulse and a strategic success. The staff at Kluck's headquarters {{claimed that the}} two-day battle had failed to envelop the British, due to <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the army to Bülow and the 2nd Army headquarters, which had insisted that the 1st Army keep closer to the western flank, rather than attack {{to the west of}} Mons. It was believed that only part of the BEF had been engaged and that there was a main line of defence from Valenciennes to Bavay, which Kluck ordered to be enveloped on 25 August. The 1st Army was delayed by the British and suffered many casualties but crossed the barrier of the Mons–Condé Canal and began its advance into France. The Germans drove the BEF and French armies before them almost to Paris, before being stopped at the Battle of the Marne.|$|E

25|$|Tibet {{was clearly}} {{subordinate}} to the Qing {{by the end of}} the 18th century. But with the arrival of the 19th century, especially with the weakening of the Qing dynasty itself in the later half of the 19th century, Qing authority over Tibet gradually weakened to the point of being minuscule, or merely symbolic. Chinese historians argue that the ambans presence was an expression of Chinese sovereignty, while those favouring Tibetan independence claims tend to equate the ambans with ambassadors. The relationship between Tibet and (Qing) China was that of patron and priest and was not based on <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> one to the other, according to the 13th Dalai Lama. (The 13th Dalai Lama was deposed in 1904, reinstated in 1908 and deposed again in 1910 by the Qing government, but these pronouncements were not taken seriously in Lhasa.) However, in the 1860s the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the Qing Empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{production}} {{began to}} decline in the 1560s, and Honduras rapidly declined in importance. <b>The</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> Honduras to the Captaincy General of Guatemala had been reaffirmed with the move of the capital to Antigua, {{and the status of}} Honduras as a province within the Captaincy General of Guatemala would be maintained until independence. Beginning in 1569, new silver strikes in the interior briefly revived the economy and led to the founding of the town of Tegucigalpa, which soon began to rival Comayagua as the most important town in the province. But the silver boom peaked in 1584, and economic depression returned shortly thereafter. Mining efforts in Honduras were hampered by a lack of capital and labor, difficult terrain, the limited size of many gold and silver deposits, and bureaucratic regulations and incompetence. Mercury, vital to the production of silver, was constantly in short supply; once an entire year's supply was lost through the negligence of officials. By the 17th century, Honduras had become a poor and neglected backwater of the Spanish colonial empire, having a scattered population of mestizos, native people, blacks, and a handful of Spanish rulers and landowners.|$|E
500|$|The {{lead role}} of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the {{traditional}} [...] "frontman" [...] or bandleader {{role of the}} vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two [...] "contend for dominance" [...] {{in a spirit of}} [...] "affectionate rivalry".

500|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} David {{had to deal with}} as king was an ecclesiastical dispute with the English church. The problem with the English church concerned <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> Scottish sees to the archbishops of York and/or Canterbury, an issue which since his election in 1124 had prevented Robert of Scone from being consecrated to the see of St Andrews (Cell Ríghmonaidh). It is likely that since the 11th century the bishopric of St Andrews functioned as a de facto archbishopric.

500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the {{optimism}} of liberal theology was discredited. Many liberal theologians turned to neo-orthodoxy in an attempt to correct what were seen as the failings of liberalism, namely an overemphasis on divine immanence and the goodness of humanity along with <b>the</b> <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> American Protestantism to secularism, science, and American culture. Neo-orthodox theologians instead emphasized divine transcendence and the sinfulness of humanity. From the 1940s into the 1950s, neo-orthodoxy set the tone at Presbyterian seminaries. Prominent Presbyterian theologians of this era include Elmer George Homrighausen and Joseph Haroutunian.|$|E
