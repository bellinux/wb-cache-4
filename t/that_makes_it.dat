5|$|Structural DNA nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as SDN, {{focuses on}} synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The nucleic acid double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible to predict and design {{the structures of}} more complicated nucleic acid complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.|$|E
5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it.</b> These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E

Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> appear human.|$|E

The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E
5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E

5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E

5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
