Cyclone Cynthia developed rapidly in the Mozambique Channel on February16 and struck western Madagascar, killing 36people and ruining local rice harvests. A residual trough after Cynthia dissipated spawned Tropical Storm Debra, which looped in the Mozambique Channel. Toward the end of the month, Tropical Storm Elma exited the basin into the adjacent Australian region, only to re-enter the south-west Indian Ocean and dissipate. Long-lived Cyclone Fatima originated in the Australian basin in late March and changed directions before becoming extratropical. On April2, a tropical depression struck eastern Madagascar, killing 18people. The final storm, Gritelle, was named on June10, <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> record.|$|E

To keep the cooperation going, a committee was established, consisting of Wallenberg, Kampmann and Einar Isdahl from DNL.

SAS would be established as a multi-national consortium, and the three national airlines would remain as holding companies. The consortium would be exempt from taxation, although the liability would be passed on to the holding companies, who would also own the aircraft and all real estate in the respective countries. The aircraft would be leased to SAS, who would also take over all employees.|$|E

25|$|As {{elections}} have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known {{well ahead of}} time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years. The election campaign must run {{for a minimum of}} 25 days or a maximum of 55 days, therefore the Governor would have needed to issue writs for the election by 21 February 2006 at <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b> <b>On</b> 20 February, Premier Mike Rann invited Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson to issue writs for the election. In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised key dates for the election of the House of Assembly and half of the Legislative Council – close of rolls on 27 February 2006 at noon, nominations to be received by 2 March 2006 at noon, polling day on 18 March 2006, and the return of writs on or before 28 April 2006.|$|E
2500|$|For most {{of their}} history Christians have {{calculated}} Easter independently of the Jewish calendar. In principle, Easter falls on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the northern spring equinox (the paschal full moon). However, the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation. The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March (previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox). The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar, which again varied in different areas. While Easter now falls at the earliest on the 15th of the lunar month and at <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> the 21st, in some areas it used to fall at the earliest on the 14th (the day of the paschal full moon) and at <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> the 20th, or between the sixteenth and the 22nd. The last limit arises {{from the fact that}} the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th (the eve of the Passover) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth. The [...] "computus" [...] is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March, and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year. The synodic month had already been measured to a high degree of accuracy. The schematic model that eventually was accepted is the Metonic cycle, which equates 19 tropical years to 235 synodic months.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a record}} of 74–40, the Expos had {{the best record in}} {{baseball}} on the morning of August 12, when MLB's players went on strike. The season began without a collective bargaining agreement as MLB's owners could not agree on how to share revenue between teams. [...] Many teams were unwilling to agree to revenue sharing unless a salary cap was put in place, something which the Major League Baseball Players' Association (MLBPA) adamantly opposed. Unable to come to an agreement, the owners attempted to unilaterally force their system into effect, prompting the players to walk out. [...] Most of the players believed they would be back on the field by the American Labor Day at <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b> <b>On</b> September 14, following a month of fruitless negotiations, the remainder of the season was cancelled.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, , a {{researcher}} at the Institute for Peace Support and Conflict Management of the National Defense Academy in Vienna, noted that in September 2008 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at the Valdai International Discussion Club told his audience about his meeting with Chinese officials {{on the day of the}} opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing, where he recognised China’s problem with Taiwan and therefore did not press China to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; Malek concluded that Putin considered the recognition of the independence of Georgia’s separatist regions, at <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> <b>on</b> 8 August. Malek also wrote that Russia's aim was to prevent Georgia’s restoration of its territorial integrity, humiliate Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, intimidate the Georgian nation and damage Georgia’s economy and civilian infrastructure, thus undermining its relevance as a gas and oil transit country. Furthermore, Russia's intention was to send a strong signal to the US, NATO and the EU with the subtext not to [...] "meddle in" [...] the areas belonging to the former Soviet Union, because the Kremlin officially considers them as [...] "zone of vital interests".|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{persists}} {{over whether}} the Rus' were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts {{to address this question}} instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the [...] "Normanist" [...] view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at <b>the</b> <b>latest.</b> <b>On</b> balance, {{it seems likely that the}} Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.|$|E

The date is given in Owen and Blakeway's 1805 History of Shrewsbury, which gives it also as the date on which the corporation voted Thomas Blake £5 annually as incumbent of St Alkmund's, so it may represent the date of his official confirmation in office, rather than his actual starting date. Rigg {{thought that it was}} here Fisher was [...] "curate to Thomas Blake." [...] A petition of 1596 to the corporation referred to a vacancy that then existed in the [...] "Curatship of St. Maris," [...] showing that the incumbent of St Mary's was generally known as the curate, as was the case at other Shrewsbury churches. Fisher was a curate alongside Blake, not to him or under him. He replaced James Betton, who had returned to Shrewsbury after it fell to Parliamentarians in February 1645 but later moved to Worthen. The terms were generous: the public preacher's salary of £46 13s. 4d. and an additional £20 from lands bought with a bequest. The other important incumbent in the town centre was Thomas Paget, elected curate of St Chad's by the congregation. He was an older man who had made a considerable impression in 1641 by presenting Parliament with a book by his brother John that advocated a Presbyterian polity.|$|E
