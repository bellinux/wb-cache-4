5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. <b>The</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle {{was built}} between the River Stour and the Chilton Stream {{and took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more common one. The motte is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chilton.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Drivers of {{vehicles}} focus their gaze in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> movement, try to assess <b>the</b> contours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road ahead, {{and try to}} avoid imminent hazards by steering or braking. However, driving at night is risky since the range illuminated by the headlights and that of visibility is poor. This paper proposes a system that assists the driver by indicating <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road ahead at night. Their curves are estimated from the 3 D positions of delineators located on <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> roads, which are extracted using a circle detection filter.

25|$|This {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coltman and built in 1937 to house {{the headquarters of the}} Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Malaysia, and is a masterpiece of the Art Deco style. Located at the junction of Jalan Hang Kasturi and Leboh Pasar Besar (just behind the Central Market), it has the advantage of double frontage. The three-storey building follows <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road. Unlike other Art Deco facades, the corner of the building is not accentuated due to the recessed entrance and the regularly spaced windows that flow across the facade. At one end is a tapering stepped pylon with a flagpole on top. A muted mosaic panel runs up the centre of the pylon. It included underground parking for bicycles. Internally, an interesting feature is an old elevator with brass and wood fittings and an oversized round window. The main OCBC Bank branch is now newly located at Jalan Tun Perak.|$|E
25|$|Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play {{a special}} role. After 566 BC—when the Panathenaic {{celebrations}} were introduced or reorganized—they were {{the prize for}} the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city's main export goods. On the front they routinely bore {{the image of the}} goddess Athena standing between two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a short neck and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC the vase shoulders were considerably reduced in width and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vase body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower.|$|E
25|$|Closer to the road, on the {{northern}} sections in Columbia and Dutchess counties, the road was routed to showcase a nearby view of wooded hillside or a farm. Since trucks were not permitted on the road—for some time, this even included privately owned pickup trucks used solely for personal use—in many sections tree branches overhang the roadways, creating a park-like feel. <b>The</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northbound AMVETS Memorial Bridge over Croton Reservoir echoes the surrounding hills. On the medians and berms, plantings were carefully planned to maintain continuity with the surrounding woods. On the descent into Peekskill Hollow in Putnam Valley, the trees and shrubs above the retaining wall {{on the east side}} were transplanted from the path of the highway, which retained the appearance of the local forest and saved money. Overpasses, both carrying roads over the parkway and carrying it over roads, were faced in native stone. The grade intersections, usually a feature engineers tried to avoid, helped keep local east–west routes open and connect the parkway to the landscape it traversed.|$|E

25|$|The {{only natural}} {{satellite}} of earth i.e.moon takes about 27.3 days {{to make one}} complete orbit around the earth. The earth orbits around the sun once every 365.2422 days (= earth’s orbital speed of 29.79km per second). The earth and the moon in 27.3 days have moved as a system about 1/12 of {{the way around the}} sun. This means that from one full moon to the next full moon, the moon must travel 2.2 extra days before it appears full moon. This is due to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth’s orbit around the sun. The moon is still making one complete orbit (circle) in 27.3 days. But to line up with the earth and sun to become a full moon again it takes 29.531 days which means 354.372 days per lunar year. This makes a variance of 10.87 days a year between a lunar year and a solar year of 365.2422 days per year. To compensate this difference, the additional month is added after every 32.5 months on an average.|$|E
25|$|Sculpture. There is a sharp circumbasal carina. Above {{this is a}} broad shallow furrow. About {{one third}} up the whorl is a narrow and blunt liration. A little more remote is a third, {{separated}} by a narrow, horizontal, flat surface from the suture. All these three lirations are orname ted with little tubercles or blunt spines, which are strongest on the highest thread, and there number about twenty-five on the body whorl, on the second thread there are about twenty-eight. The base, which is rather flatly arched, has round the outside a flat surface hardly deep enough {{to be called a}} furrow, defined on the inner side by a clear narrow line, within which <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base rises a little and has some faint spirals. The edge of the umbilicus is sharply defined by a fine line, outside of which is a broad shallow furrow bordered externally by a slight spiral. There is another narrower furrow, the outer side of which is the most projecting part of the base, but beyond this is rather flat and has some obsolete spirals. On the upper whorls the spirals are feeble and without tubercles, which only appear distinctly on the fourth whorl.|$|E
25|$|If we draw {{a square}} and divide each side into three {{so that the}} middle parts are greater than the others, and then divide the area into nine from these points, we {{approximate}} to the typical setting out of a plan of this time. Now add three apses {{on the east side}} opening from the three divisions, and opposite to the west put a narrow entrance porch running right across the front. Still in front put a square court. The court is the atrium and usually has a fountain in the middle under a canopy resting on pillars. The entrance porch is the narthex. Directly under the center of the dome is the ambo, from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers. Across {{the eastern side of the}} central square was a screen which divided off the bema, where the altar was situated, from the body of the church; this screen, bearing images, is the iconostasis. The altar was protected by a canopy or ciborium resting on pillars. Rows of rising seats around <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apse with the patriarch's throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon. The two smaller compartments and apses at the sides of the bema were sacristies, the diaconicon and prothesis. The ambo and bema were connected by the solea, a raised walkway enclosed by a railing or low wall.|$|E
