50|$|Dee is made a {{minister}} to the dislike of Yuchi, however they both find <b>the</b> <b>spy</b> <b>within</b> the Da Lisi and while fighting him off, they encounter the sea monster. Yuchi saves a drowning Dee during the fight. Dee admits he can't swim and they fail to lure in the sea monster again. They question a recovering Yuan {{who says he was}} imprisoned at an island in the sea and that he released the sea monster raised by the Dondo rebels while escaping. Meanwhile, Empress Wu imprisons Ruiji since she hails from Fuyu Kingdom but Dee makes a bet with the Empress that if he kills the rebels in a day she should release Ruiji. Dee and Yuchi deduce that the rebels must be hiding in the Bat island based on the clues and set sail towards the island. They surround the island at night, a fight ensues {{and the head of the}} Dondo rebel is eventually killed. While returning from the island they encounter the sea monster which destroys two of the three ships. As Dee does not know how to swim, Yuchi helps him escape using a horse which can swim. Finally they shoot the sea monster and launch poisoned fish bait at it. The sea monster drags down the third ship but lets go as the poison takes effect and it dies. The Da Lisi return victoriously and Dee is awarded a prestigious sword by the Emperor. A cured Yuan and Ruiji flee the city in order to avoid conflicts on the advise of Dee.|$|E

In exchange, Telerig asked the emperor to reveal <b>the</b> <b>spies</b> to his associates in Pliska for their own safety.

40|$|Equity {{options are}} known to be {{notoriously}} difficult to price accurately, and even with the development of established mathematical models there are many assumptions that must be made about the underlying processes driving market movements. As such, the theoretical prices outputted by these models are often slightly different from the realized or actual market price. The choice of model traders use can create many different valuations on the same asset, which may lead to a form of systematic micro-movement or noise.

50|$|The Schwarze Kapelle (German for Black Orchestra) was a {{term used}} by the Gestapo {{to refer to a}} group of conspirators within the German {{military}} who plotted to overthrow Adolf Hitler.

5|$|The {{open and}} idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's {{immediate}} supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed to defend <b>the</b> division. <b>Spies</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> department, under {{the instruction of}} Mark E. Peterson, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In {{a meeting with the}} first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the Ensign, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the Ensign did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{duty for}} <b>the</b> OVRA was <b>spying</b> on Pope Pius XI as the Roman Catholic Church was an {{extremely}} powerful institution in Italian life that the Fascist regime never controlled, instead having a partnership. As some Roman Catholic priests were homosexuals with very active sex lives, it was a common practice of the OVRA to catch them in flagrante delicto and blackmail them into <b>spying</b> for <b>the</b> OVRA, which always very well informed about {{the affairs of the}} Holy See. The American historian David Kertzer described <b>the</b> OVRA's <b>spy</b> network <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Vatican as [...] "robust" [...] comprising four highly placed clerics and a number of lay Vatican employees. Mussolini was fascinated by these reports of the homosexual sex lives of the senior Catholic clerics and always had them sent to his office for him to read.|$|R

Pitt, who was previously believed dead after being last seen on board a crashed helicopter, reemerges to expose <b>the</b> Soviet <b>spies</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> salvage crew. After the crew, with the help of SEALs who boarded from a hidden U.S. Navy submarine, regains control of the Titanic the ship is eventually towed to New York Harbor and laid up in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. When the ships vault is opened, all are shocked to discover the byzanium was never actually aboard the ship. This revelation, coupled with deep troubles with his marriage and the Presidents agreement to leaking word of the Sicilian Project to the Soviets, eventually cause Dr. Seagram to have a nervous breakdown from which he never recovers. It is eventually revealed that Joshua Hayes Brewster, fearful that he would not make it onto the ship with the mineral, buried the byzanium in the grave of Vernon Hall, the last of the group to fall to the French assassins, located in the tiny English village of Southby. The novel ends with a successful test of the Sicilian Project in the Pacific Ocean.|$|R

Golitsyn had told the US that there was a similar highly placed <b>spy</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> CIA he knew only by the code name [...] "Sasha".

Aspersions were cast across the CIA and outside it and many people's careers were ruined when Angleton suggested they might be Sasha.|$|R
40|$|The {{creative}} {{component of}} this thesis is a novel, The Scribbler‚Äôs Tales, set in late seventeenth-century London. My narrator, Nathaniel Spicer, writes from Marshalsea Prison, {{where he is}} held for seditious libel. The tales he tells mix history, fiction and myth to narrate London‚Äôs rise out of {{the ashes of the}} Great Fire, as well as Nathaniel‚Äôs involvement in the rise of professional journalism and partisan politics. My narrative is inspired by Robert Mayer‚Äôs argument that: ‚Äòin the seventeenth century historical discourse embraced not only ‚Äúhistory‚Äù in its modern sense, but also fiction, polemic, gossip, and marvels‚Äô. The Scribbler‚Äôs Tales experiments with this ambivalent mode of narration, seeking a modern style of storytelling to match the ambiguity that critics such as Kate Loveman have identified in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century fictions. I refer to these theories in the critical part of my thesis, which examines Ned Ward‚Äôs periodical <b>The</b> London <b>Spy</b> (1698 - 1700) within the discursive spaces of late seventeenth-century London. Unlike critics who have either dismissed or re-evaluated Ward in relation to aesthetic or social value criteria, I seek to explore, not ignore, his inherent ambivalence. I relate this ambivalence to his identity as a professional writer or ‚Äòscribbler‚Äô, portrayed by contemporaries as a hybrid figure straddling the commercial and literary realms. To approach Ward‚Äôs work in a fresh way, I treat him as part of an evolving commercialised literary culture. I place <b>The</b> London <b>Spy</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> context of the London print trade, and analyse Ward‚Äôs rhetorical and narrative strategies in relation to satire, the grotesque and the blurring of fiction and fact. I anchor these discussions in my analysis of Ward‚Äôs representation of discourse ‚Äì the words spoken, written and performed by his narrator and characters ‚Äì which he locates in the public spaces of his fictionalised London...|$|R

5000|$|This game {{is played}} with one hider (spy) and many hunters (guards). It is best done in a dark building.

Guards can try to catch <b>the</b> <b>spy</b> even if he is outside but hasn't yet reached his base. If a lone guard sees <b>the</b> <b>spy,</b> they have to tag him.
