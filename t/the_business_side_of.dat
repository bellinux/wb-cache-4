5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his idea than the technical.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Zappa {{continued}} to develop <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> his career. He and Herb Cohen formed the Bizarre Records and Straight Records labels, distributed by Warner Bros. Records, as ventures {{to aid the}} funding of projects and to increase creative control. Zappa produced the double album Trout Mask Replica for Captain Beefheart, and releases by Alice Cooper, The Persuasions, Wild Man Fischer, and the GTOs, as well as Lenny Bruce's last live performance.|$|R

5|$|Crystal Palace Football Club {{was formed}} on 10 September 1905 {{playing in the}} Aston Villa colours of claret and blue. The choice of colours {{was a result of}} the {{important}} role in the club's formation played by Edmund Goodman, an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, William McGregor. Goodman organised <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the club and managed the team from 1907 to 1925. A former amateur player with Villa, Goodman had lost his right leg after an injury led to amputation. Goodman hired John Robson from Middlesbrough to be the team's manager. Robson had transformed his previous club from an amateur side to an established Football League First Division side.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{producing}} {{the music for}} Myth II, Bungie contracted O'Donnell for several of Bungie's other projects, including the third-person game Oni. In 1999, Bungie wanted to re-negotiate the contracts for Oni, and the negotiations resulted in O'Donnell joining the Bungie team, only ten days before the company was bought by Microsoft. O'Donnell {{was one of only}} a handful of Bungie employees who remained working at the company since then, until his termination as of April 2014. While O'Donnell worked at Bungie, Salvatori handled <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> TotalAudio.|$|E

5000|$|According to E. Ted Prince, [...] "Financial {{literacy}} is almost never {{the need for}} senior managers and high potentials. Most already possess degrees in business, including MBAs, and many have also had experience in <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> their professional roles. The need for these managers is to understand how their actions and their behavior impact their financial decision-making and how this in turn affects financial outcomes at the unit and the corporate level." [...] It's evident that an individual with business acumen has some level of financial understanding and knowledge - but someone who is financially literate doesn't necessarily possess strong business acumen.|$|R

25|$|Another {{appeal of}} the railroads is <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> railroading. Railroads were long central to {{economic}} growth and commerce, and still are to some extent. The history of railroads and railroaders (such as James J. Hill) is a fascination for some, whether they view them {{in a positive way}} as capitalist heroes or in a negative way as robber barons.|$|E
25|$|In early August 2005, Lisa Marie Presley sold 85% of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her father's estate.

25|$|With Harold running <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the {{operation}} and Alfred as Editor, the Mail from the start adopted an imperialist political stance, taking a patriotic line in the Second Boer War, leading to claims {{that it was not}} reporting the issues of the day objectively. From the beginning, the Mail also set out to entertain its readers with human interest stories, serials, features and competitions (which were also the main means by which the Harmsworths promoted the paper).|$|E
25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public {{administration}} does not only focus on <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> administration {{but also on}} the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets {{record by}} {{striking}} out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped {{it with a}} then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan {{never wanted to be}} traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> baseball.|$|E
25|$|Reed began <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{his career}} in 1836 as an {{apprentice}} to a firm of woolen manufacturers at Leeds. In 1839, with his friend Thomas Edward Plint, he started and edited a magazine called The Leeds Repository, and on returning to London he co-founded the firm of Tyler & Reed, printers and typefounders in 1842. Reed changed business partners several times, becoming {{a partner in the}} famous Fann Street Foundry in Fann Street off Aldersgate Street in 1866 (which thereby became 'Reed & Fox'). The Fann Street business formed the basis for his own typefounding business Sir Charles Reed & Sons, whose office at 33 Aldersgate Street is illustrated.|$|E
25|$|Tunney cut Watson in on <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> things. Their {{combined}} booking efforts {{resulted in}} large fortunes {{for the two}} of them. With connections to St. Louis promoter Tom Packs, Watson’s notoriety resulted in Watson ending Longson’s four year title reign with a victory at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis on February 21, 1947. The territory of St. Louis became a home away from home for Watson. More than 10,000 St. Louis fans watched local hero Lou Thesz beat Watson for the world title on April 25, 1947. After Packs retired in 1948, Tunney bought into the territory in St. Louis and this resulted in many more matches for Watson in the city.|$|E

25|$|Buss {{continued}} {{to learn the}} basketball business from his father as well as West and then Kupchak, who was promoted to general manager in 2000. After the Lakers lost in the 2004 NBA Finals, Buss decided that the Lakers would sign Rudy Tomjanovich to replace the outgoing Phil Jackson. That summer, Tomjanovich was signed to a five-year, $30 million contract. Tomjanovich resigned after a half season, citing mental and physical exhaustion. The Lakers paid him a $10 million settlement, leading to speculation that the Lakers had instead terminated his contract. In 2005, Buss was promoted to vice president of player personnel. His father's plan was to have Buss handle the basketball decisions for the team, while his sister Jeanie, {{the vice president of}} business operations, handled <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Lakers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his musical career, Gryce was a vehement advocate of composers' and musicians' rights. In 1955 he started his own publishing company, Melotone Music, and later an additional company called Totem. This {{was a time when}} black musicians in particularly were taken advantage of by the music industry. Many musicians neglected <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> their careers or were actively cheated by record companies. As a composer Gryce always ensured that he got credit for his work, and actively encouraged his colleagues to do the same. Silver largely credits Gryce with inspiring him to found his Ecaroh Music company and the Silveto label. Little is known about Gryce's financial troubles in the early 1960s, but this hardship very much contributed to Gryce's breakdown and withdrawal from the jazz community.|$|E
25|$|Life {{was founded}} January 4, 1883, in a New York City artist's studio at 1155 Broadway, as a {{partnership}} between John Ames Mitchell and Andrew Miller. Mitchell held a 75 per cent interest in the magazine with the remainder by Miller. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths. Miller served as secretary-treasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the operation. Mitchell, a 37-year-old illustrator who used a $10,000 inheritance {{to invest in the}} weekly magazine, served as its publisher. Mitchell created the first Life name-plate with cupids as mascots; he later drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil. Mitchell took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using zinc-coated plates, which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork. This edge helped because Life faced stiff competition from the best-selling humor magazines Judge and Puck, which were already established and successful. Edward Sandford Martin was brought on as Lifes first literary editor; the recent Harvard University graduate was a founder of the Harvard Lampoon.|$|E
