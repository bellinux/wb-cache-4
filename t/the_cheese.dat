5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E

One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of <b>the</b> <b>cheese,</b> they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E

Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could be brought to market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The 25 {{investigated}} Salers <b>cheeses</b> graded by <b>the</b> professional committee {{offered a}} large range of textures. Their texture characteristics were investigated by sensory analysis, rheological measurements and fluorescence spectroscopy. The 8 sensory attributes {{generated by the}} panel in-cluded the evaluation of mechanical, geometric and surface properties, and allowed the characterisa-tion of the texture of <b>the</b> investigated <b>cheeses.</b> <b>The</b> stress values at 20 % compression ranged between 0. 073 and 0. 290 kPa. The fluorescence spectra of protein tryptophans and vitamin A were recorded directly on the samples. Principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis were {{used to evaluate the}} data and to investigate the relationships between the different sets of data recorded on <b>the</b> same <b>cheeses.</b> All <b>the</b> methods used to analyse <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> allowed discrimination of the samples, i. e. the obtained data constituted fingerprints of <b>the</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Moreover, strong correlations were found between the sensory attribute domain and the instrumental domains. It was also suggested that the phenomena observed at molecular and macroscopic levels were related to the texture of <b>the</b> <b>cheeses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to <b>the</b> <b>cheese.</b> Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{traditional}} <b>cheese</b> {{making of}} Gaul was celebrated by Pliny the Elder.

5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E

(During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.)

The flavor of each of <b>the</b> 42 <b>cheeses</b> is described. Similarities in flavor were observed among many of <b>the</b> individual <b>cheeses.</b> Therefore, a clustering scheme was developed to show the overall flavor relationships among <b>the</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Those relationships are schematically represented by a tree diagram.

5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. <b>The</b> <b>cheese</b> {{would need to be}} a harder one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as Welsh rabbit as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the Welsh term caws pobi. Welsh folk rarely ate rabbit due to the cost and as land owners would not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E
5|$|Like much of British post-war development, the {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by Mid-Century Modern towers such as Castlemead, Modernist architecture, and improvement and expansion to road infrastructure. The world's oldest shot tower in Redcliffe {{was lost to}} road development in 1968, being replaced the following year by <b>the</b> <b>Cheese</b> Lane Shot Tower on a different site. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing, limiting access with the closure {{of a number of}} main roads, whilst the Broadmead shopping centre has been further developed. In 2006, one of the city centre's tallest Mid-Century Modern towers was lost, with further historic 20th century structures being destroyed more recently. The transfer of the docks to Avonmouth, 7miles(11km) downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour). The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy, as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use.|$|E

40|$|Skim milk Mozzarella cheeses (negligible fat) {{were made}} using two {{maltodextrins}} (Maltrin M 1 and M 2) and a modified potato starch (StaSlim S 1) fat replacers. A control cheese {{was made with}} skim milk without any fat replacer. The texture characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> were measured with an Instron Universal Testing Machine and the microstructure examined using scanning electron microscopy. The moisture contents of the skim milk and maltodextrin based cheeses were similar, while modified potato starch-based cheeses showed significantly lower moisture levels. The protein contents of <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> made with fat replacers were significantly lower than for <b>the</b> control <b>cheeses.</b> <b>The</b> hardness values for Maltrin M 1 and M 2 cheeses were lower at 5, 10 and 18 d of storage while StaSlim S 1 cheeses {{were similar to those}} of control during storage. In general, all <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> made using fat replacers showed less cohesiveness and springiness than <b>the</b> control <b>cheeses,</b> while adhesiveness was higher. The Maltrin M 1 and M 2 cheeses showed lower values of gumminess and chewiness; however, StaSlim S 1 cheeses showed higher values, compared to control, at 5, 10 and 18 d of storage. Incorporation of fat replacers resulted in an increased openness in cheeses, and large serum channels (up to 0. 1 mm diameter) were noticeable. <b>The</b> maltodextrin-based <b>cheeses</b> showed more openness than the modified potato starch-based cheeses. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
