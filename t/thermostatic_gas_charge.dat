40|$|The further {{exploration}} and development of Pabst Gas Field with faulted sand reservoirs require {{an understanding of the}} properties and roles of faults, particularly Low Throw near Vertical Faults (LTNVFs), in gas migration and accumulation at a reservoir scale. This study presents numerical modeling of gas migration and accumulation processes in Pabst Field. Based on studies of the reservoirs, structure, faults, and fluid properties of the field, reservoir scale modeling was performed to determine the gas supply style and the fault properties by means of hundreds of iterations in which the fault properties and gas supply pattern were modified to match the gas distribution obtained from modeling with the gas distribution inferred from seismic data constrained by well data and production data. This study finds that in the main three sand reservoirs of Pabst Field the overlying younger sands cut down into the underlying older sands, so that partial connections between the three sands allow gas communication among the sands. Meanwhile, three fault families break up the three sands into numerous compartments. A primary fault and large synthetic and antithetic faults act as gas migration pathways: the synthetic and antithetic faults are inlets for gas flow and the primary fault is an outlet, and LTNVFs act as barriers to gas flow. Modeling requires fault properties in the field to change while the field is formed. The porosity and permeability of the faults in Pabst Field are 10 % and 0. 1 md, respectively, during <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> of the sand reservoirs. But when there is no <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> and large <b>gas</b> columns are maintained, the porosity and permeability of the faults decrease to 6 % and 0. 001 md, respectively. Pabst Field probably has an impulse <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> history. Fault opening and closing, <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> and recharge, and replacement of gas by formation water may occur. A combination of stratigraphy, structure, overpressure and <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> rate control <b>gas</b> migration style, <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> history, and <b>gas</b> distribution in the field. The significance of the study is that this improved numerical approach for modeling gas migration into and through specifically faulted sand reservoirs fills the gap between basin modeling and production modeling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} between reservoir tightening time and <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> period {{are the key}} subjects {{that have not been}} well solved considering the studies on the tight sand gas accumulation mechanism and enrichment regularity. The diagenetic evolution history, interaction sequence of organic–inorganic in aquiferous rock, <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> history, the tightening mechanism of tight sandstone reservoir and the {{relationship between}} reservoir tightening time and gas accumulation period of the Xujiahe Formation have been analyzed in the Yuanba–Tongnanba area of the Sichuan Basin. It has been confirmed that the main reason for the tight sandstone reservoir formation is the intensive mechanical compaction which has dramatically reduced the sandstone reservoir quality, and it resulted to a semi-closed to a closed diagenetic fluid system formation at the early diagenetic stage. In the semi-closed to a closed diagenetic fluid system, at the later part of the diagenetic stage, the fluid circulation is not smooth, and the migration of the dissolution products are blocked, hence, the dissolution products mainly undergo the in situ precipitation and cementation. Such dissolution products block the dissolution pores and the residual primary pores; and the stronger the dissolution is, the higher the cement content is, which makes the reservoir further tightened. The hydrocarbon generation and expulsion history of source rocks and reservoir fluid inclusion characteristics in the Xujiahe Formation show that the <b>charge</b> of natural <b>gas</b> occurs in the Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (mainly Early Cretaceous). A comprehensive analysis of the reservoir tightening history, <b>gas</b> <b>charge</b> history, and interaction sequence of organic–inorganic aquiferous in rock indicate that the sandstone reservoir experienced a tightening process when <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> took place in the Xujiahe Formation in the Yuanba–Tongnanba area of the Sichuan Basin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Building {{upon the}} {{foundation}} of the prior investigations, a three-fold classification of tight gas reservoirs is proposed in this paper which is based primarily on dynamic relationship between <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> history and reservoir tight-ening process, coupled with tectonic evolution, source-reservoir relationship, migration and charging pattern. The three categories of tight gas are: (1) “pre-existing ” basin-centered gas reservoir, in which the reservoir sands experienced early-stage tightening processes, occurring before peak gas generation, expulsion from source rock, and charging of reservoir; (2) “pre-existing subsequent-improved ” tight gas reservoir, in which the reservoir sands were also tightened before <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> and then underwent reservoirs improvement mainly caused by the tectonic activities; and (3) “subsequent-conventional ” tight gas reservoir where reserved sands were tightened after the peak of gas generation, expulsion from source rock, and charging of reservoir. This type of tight gas initially formed conventional gas accumulation during <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> of reservoir, and subsequently modified to tight gas reservoir. All the three categories of tight gas have different geological conditions of gas accumulation and gas accumulation patterns, which can be used as characteristics to classify these tight gas systems, and thus have distinctive control on regional gas distribution. The results of applying this tight gas classification for an actual basin show that correctly distinguishing these three kinds of tight gas reservoirs from eac...|$|R

Tight {{sandstone}} gas reservoirs in China {{are generally}} characterized by tight strata, widespread distribution areas, coal strata supplying gas, complex gas–water relations, and abnormally low gas reservoir pressure. Water and gas reversal patterns {{have been detected}} via glass tube and quartz sand modeling, {{and the presence of}} critical geological conditions without buoyancy-driven mechanisms can thus be assumed. According to the timing of <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> and reservoir tightening phases, the following three tight sandstone gas reservoir types have been identified: (a) “accumulation–densification” (AD), or the conventional tight type, (b) “densification–accumulation” (DA), or the deep tight type, and (c) the composite tight type. For the AD type, <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> occurs prior to reservoir densification, accumulating in higher positions under buoyancy-controlled mechanisms with critical controlling factors such as source kitchens (S), regional overlaying cap rocks (C), gas reservoirs, (D) and low fluid potential areas (P). For the DA type, reservoir densification prior to the <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> period (GCP) leads to accumulation in depressions and slopes largely due to hydrocarbon expansive forces without buoyancy, and critical controlling factors are effective source rocks (S), widely distributed reservoirs (D), stable tectonic settings (W) and universal densification of reservoirs (L). The composite type includes features of the AD type and DA type, and before and after reservoir densification period (RDP), <b>gas</b> <b>charging</b> and accumulation is controlled by early buoyancy and later molecular expansive force respectively. It is widely distributed in anticlinal zones, deep sag areas and slopes, and is controlled by source kitchens (S), reservoirs (D), cap rocks (C), stable tectonic settings (W), low fluid potential areas (P), and universal reservoir densification (L). Tight gas resources with great resource potential are widely distributed worldwide, and tight gas in China that presents advantageous reservoir-forming conditions is primarily found in the Ordos, Sichuan, Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami basins of central-western China. Tight gas has served as the primary impetus for global unconventional natural gas exploration and production under existing technical conditions.|$|R
