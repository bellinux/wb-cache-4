40|$|This study investigates how bilinguals use sublexical <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> <b>information</b> {{to speed}} up their word {{recognition}} process in different task situations. Norwegian-English bilinguals performed a Norwegian-English language decision task, a mixed English lexical decision task, or a mixed Norwegian lexical decision task. The mixed lexical decision experiments included words from <b>the</b> nontarget <b>language</b> that required a "no" response. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> specificity of <b>the</b> Bokmal (a Norwegian written norm) and English (non) words was varied by including language-specific letters ("smor", "hawk") or bigrams ("dusj", "veal"). Bilinguals were found to use both types of sublexical markedness to facilitate their decisions, language-specific letters leading to larger effects than language-specific bigrams. A cross-experimental comparison indicates {{that the use of}} sublexical language information was strategically dependent on the task at hand and that decisions were based on <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> <b>information</b> derived directly from sublexical (bigram) stimulus characteristics instead of indirectly via their lexical representations.

40|$|International audienceFrench-English bilinguals {{performed}} a generalized lexical decision experiment with mixed lists of French and English words and pseudo-words. In Experiment 1, each word/pseudo-word was superimposed {{on the picture}} of the French or UK flag, and flag-word congruency was manipulated. The flag was not informative with respect to either the lexical decision response or <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of <b>the</b> word. Nevertheless, lexical decisions to word stimuli were faster following the congruent flag compared with the incongruent flag, but only for French (L 1) words. Experiment 2 replicated this flag-language congruency effect in a priming paradigm, where the word and pseudo-word targets followed the brief presentation of the flag prime, and this time effects were seen in both languages. We take these findings as evidence for a mechanism that automatically processes linguistic and non-linguistic information concerning the presence or not of a given <b>language.</b> <b>Language</b> <b>membership</b> <b>information</b> can then modulate lexical processing, in line with the architecture of the BIA model, but not the BIA + model...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{concept of}} an {{interactive}} proof protocol for deciding <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> providing zero knowledge to the proof verier was introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Racko [4]. Informally, an interactive proof protocol is zero-knowledge if interacting with the prover does not provide any additional knowledge to the verier (apart possibly from the validity of <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> assertion being proven), regardless of the strategy used by the verier in interacting with the prover. In other words, the zero-knowledge property of an interactive proof system is a property of the prover 1 that is measured against all " verier strategies aimed at extracting additional knowledge from the interaction. The hard task in presenting a formal denition for zero-knowledge is quantifying what constitutes an in knowledge" resulting from an interaction. In the model of Goldwasser, Micali and Racko,...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the trace of an {{exhaustive}} DPLL search {{can be viewed as}} a compilation of the propositional theory. With different constraints imposed or lifted on the DPLL algorithm, this compilation will belong to <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of d-DNNF, FBDD, and OBDD, respectively. These languages are decreasingly succinct, yet increasingly tractable, supporting such polynomial-time queries as model counting and equivalence testing. Our contribution is thus twofold. First, we provide a uniform framework, supported by empirical evaluations, for compiling knowledge into various languages of interest. Second, we show that given a particular variant of DPLL, by identifying <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> of its traces, one gains a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic complexity and computational power of the search algorithm itself. As interesting examples, we unveil the “hidden power ” of several recent model counters, point to one of their potential limitations, and identify a key limitation of DPLLbased procedures in general. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPattern {{selector}} grammars {{are defined}} in general. We {{concentrate on the}} study of special grammars, the pattern selectors of which contain precisely κ “one”s (0 ∗(10 ∗) κ) or κ adjacent “one”s (0 ∗ 1 κ 0 ∗). This means that precisely κ symbols (resp. κ adjacent symbols) in each sentential form are rewritten. The main results concern parsing algorithms and the complexity of the membership problem. We first obtain a polynomial bound on the shortest derivation and hence an NP time bound for parsing. In the case κ = 2, we generalize the well-known context-free dynamic programming type algorithms, which run in polynomial time. It is shown that <b>the</b> generated <b>languages,</b> for κ = 2, are log-space reducible to <b>the</b> context-free <b>languages.</b> <b>The</b> <b>membership</b> problem is thus solvable in log 2 space...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} develops theory-independent diagnostics {{for identifying}} {{the status of}} single-word incorporations of one <b>language</b> occurring in <b>the</b> discourse of another. Our investigation {{is based on the}} premises of Variation theory requiring systematic evaluation of a spoken-language corpus, and exhaustive quantitative analysis of inherent variability not only in mixed or bilingual language, but more innovatively in the unmixed or monolingual vernaculars, which are in contact. We hypothesize that (1) if the contentious lone items are code-switched, i. e. produced by <b>the</b> donor <b>language,</b> their patterns of behavior should be similar to those of their unmixed donor-language counterparts, {{while at the same time}} differing from those of their unmixed recipient-language counterparts; (2) if such items pattern similarly to their unmixed recipient-language counterparts, while differing from their unmixed donor-language counterparts, we infer that they were produced by <b>the</b> recipient <b>language,</b> and hence are borrowed; and (3) if their patterns follow neither donor- nor recipient-language counterparts, they could be produced by some other language contact phenomena. We test this hypothesis by analyzing natural performance bilingual data involving two typologically different languages, Ukrainian (a Slavic language) and English. Numerous morpho-syntactic differences between these two languages provide a wide range of 'conflict sites', which allow us to observe the differences in their patterns, and hence, to reveal unambiguously <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> of <b>the</b> items in question. The results showed that lone English-origin items occurring in Ukrainian discourse were not produced exclusively by one process. The majority of them were borrowed, whereas some were code-switched. None, however, were produced by any other phenomena. Borrowed items, either nonce or established, were shown to acquire all morpho-syntactic features required for a particular part of speech, and applied those features with the same variability as their Ukrainian counterparts. Code-switched English-origin utterances clearly failed to fulfill Ukrainian requirements (with respect to gender assignment, different types of agreement, syntactic position, etc.), and exhibited behavior similar to their unmixed English counterparts. We have also found that a switch site constitutes a 'barrier' for language-specific features, but not for the universal ones. Having succeeded in applying this diagnostics to code-switching/borrowing identification, this study reveals a detailed view of what the process of integration is at the moment of borrowing, i. e. on the synchronic level. It consists of applying the patterns of <b>the</b> <b>language</b> in which they are incorporated, either standard or non-standard, to other-language items in exactly the same way, as to the recipient-language counterparts. Thus, this research provides clear indication that the source grammar of inherently ambiguous forms in bilingual discourse can be empirically determined by using a comparative method applied to an entire corpus of natural performance data, using appropriate diagnostics, focusing on language-specific features, and making use of, rather than avoiding, inherent variability...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of deciding <b>membership</b> in Dyck <b>languages,</b> a fundamental family of context-free languages, comprised of well-balanced strings of parentheses. In this problem we are given a string of length n in the alphabet of parentheses of m types and must decide if it is well-balanced. We consider this problem in the property testing setting, where one {{would like to make}} the decision while querying as few characters of the input as possible. Property testing of strings for Dyck <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> for m= 1, with a number of queries independent of the input size n, was provided in [Alon, Krivelevich, Newman and Szegedy, SICOMP 2001]. Property testing of strings for Dyck <b>language</b> <b>membership</b> for m > 2 was first investigated in [Parnas, Ron and Rubinfeld, RSA 2003]. They showed an upper bound and a lower bound for distinguishing strings belonging to <b>the</b> <b>language</b> from strings that are far (in terms of the Hamming distance) from <b>the</b> <b>language,</b> which are respectively (up to polylogarithmic factors) the 2 / 3 power and the 1 / 11 power of the input size n. Here we improve the power of n in both bounds. For the upper bound, we introduce a recursion technique, that together with a refinement of the methods in the original work provides a test for any power of n larger than 2 / 5. For the lower bound, we introduce a new problem called Truestring Equivalence, which is easily reducible to the 2 -type Dyck language property testing problem. For this new problem, we show a lower bound of n to the power of 1 / 5...|$|R
