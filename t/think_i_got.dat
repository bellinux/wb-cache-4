500|$|The Los Angeles Times spent a full {{paragraph}} on a vignette {{about two}} high school prom dresses. [...] The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy. Every time I thought I knew which one I was, I {{turned out to be the}} other. Which is one reason I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> married, to, like, end the confusion." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a little nervous about the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So I wanted to give myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E

500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: {{goes on and on}} about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, you get the feeling the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani considered [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] one of the album's [...] "best offerings", comparing the song to Christina Aguilera's [...] "Desnudate" [...] (2010).|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E

"We {{said there}} was just no way they were getting {{into the end zone}} after they blocked that punt," [...] said Simpson (a college {{teammate}} of DuPree at Michigan State University) after the game.

[...] We both dove for him the moment Staubach threw. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a hand on the ball. [...] We had to play him tough. [...] Goddamn it was the whole season on one play.

2500|$|On September 16, 2013, Nipsey Hussle {{announced}} he would release a new mixtape titled, Crenshaw hosted by DJ Drama, on October 8, 2013. He explained the title saying, [...] "This is my area. This is my home town. This is really like where I {{spent a lot of}} my time as a youth. Crenshaw is a foundation to my personality and my story. It’s where it took place at." [...] He explained the mixtape consists of mostly leftover tracks, [...] "I recorded a lot of songs for the Victory Lap project, and I got a certain vision I'm going for with the project, and I just did a lot of work and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> what I was looking for with the Victory Lap album, and I still got a lot of great records. So I'm like, I don't wanna sit on the songs, and I listened to the playlist and it kinda sounded like Crenshaw, it sounded like the environment, like my upbringing. So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like. And really kinda like, create the question in their mind, 'if this is the mixtape, what is gunna be on the album?'" ...|$|E
