These methods do not search directly the solution space; {{they do it}} indirectly through {{the exploration of the}} space of heuristics and/or their combinations. This space is named <b>the</b> <b>associated</b> space. <b>The</b> task of finding the best element in <b>the</b> <b>associated</b> space is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>associated</b> problem.
