50|$|MAS grew a {{fleet of}} piston engined {{aircraft}} to handle the local charter demand to game parks and other places of tourist interest. At its peak the charter firm had 12 aircraft, some owned and some leased. All the aircraft were maintained by CMC Aviation owned by the publicly traded Cooper Motor Corporation. To provide capital and purchase larger, more reliable <b>turbo-prop</b> <b>aircraft</b> to operate scheduled services, the firm was sold to CMC who subsequently sold to the Sameer Group and the operations moved to Nairobi.

50|$|Flight {{numbers and}} {{schedules}} were strictly controlled, and TAA and Ansett-ANA invariably had flights departing airports {{for the same}} destination {{at exactly the same}} time with exactly the same equipment. The policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft (one from each airline) were required on their delivery flights to enter Australian airspace at exactly the same time.The conservative government's benevolent attitude towards Ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced TAA to swap a number of its popular <b>turbo-prop</b> Viscount <b>aircraft</b> with Ansett-ANA in return for slower and older, piston-engined Douglas DC-6Bs. In another instance, TAA had planned to re-equip with the revolutionary Sud Aviation Caravelle pure-jet but as Ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for their own needs, both airlines were required to purchase the Ansett preference; the less advanced turbo-prop Lockheed L-188 Electra.|$|R

40|$|Algorithms are {{described}} for integration of Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) data with Inertial Navigation System (INS) data {{to provide an}} integrated DGPS/INS navigation system. The objective is to establish the benefits {{that can be achieved}} through various levels of integration of DGPS with INS for precision navigation. An eight state Kalman filter integration was implemented in real-time on a twin <b>turbo-prop</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> to evaluate system performance during terminal approach and landing operations. A fully integrated DGPS/INS system is also presented which models accelerometer and rate-gyro measurement errors plus position, velocity, and attitude errors. The fully integrated system was implemented off-line using range-domain (seventeen-state) and position domain (fifteen-state) Kalman filters. Both filter integration approaches were evaluated using data collected during the flight test. Flight-test data consisted of measurements from a 5 channel Precision Code GPS receiver, a strap-down Inertial Navigation Unit (INU), and GPS satellite differential range corrections from a ground reference station. The aircraft was laser tracked to determine its true position. Results indicate that there is no significant improvement in positioning accuracy with the higher levels of DGPS/INS integration. All three systems provided high-frequency (e. g., 20 Hz) estimates of position and velocity. The fully integrated system provided estimates of inertial sensor errors which may be used to improve INS navigation accuracy should GPS become unavailable, and improved estimates of acceleration, attitude, and body rates which can be used for guidance and control. Precision Code DGPS/INS positioning accuracy (root-mean-square) was 1. 0 m cross-track and 3. 0 m vertical. (This AGARDograph was sponsored by the Guidance and Control Panel. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of design, {{development}} and certification of a <b>turbo-prop</b> Light Transport <b>Aircraft</b> (LTA), an important aspect is to establish the installed performance of the engine before carrying out actual flight tests. In this context, it is relevant to study and analyse behaviour of the engine air intake performance before commencing actual flight tests. CFD analysis of flow {{in and around the}} nacelle and engine air intake duct was carried out using two RANS based models, S-A and SST k-omega using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent. Special emphasis was laid on developing a good quality mesh for the computational domain with a finer boundary layer mesh along the wall and by maintaining a higher density mesh at critical areas. Ram air recovery and mass flow rate of main air intake duct has been established from the results obtained. The results obtained from the CFD study have shown that the inlet system pressure loss and ram air recovery are within limits prescribed by the engine original equipment manufacturer. From the overall analysis, total pressure total pressure recovery at the plenum was found satisfactory for all flight cases, covering variation in the Mach number, altitude and nacelle AOA. Inlet pressure losses obtained by CFD computations are in good agreement with experimental results. Engine ground run test results have conducted have indicated Qualitative results obtained from CFD show that the behaviour of the engine intake is consistent across flight conditions...|$|R

The data, so acquired during the 13; flight test is used to evaluate the flight performance of aircraft and its subx 2013;systems in terms of their design 13; objectives complying with design, development and testing standards. 13; The primary objectives of flight-testing are to find the transparent or hidden design problem and to fix them 13; as part of the process. Also the document verification with regard to the compliance to the relevant standards 13; based on aircraft category along with aircraft system functionality requirements. 13; SARAS, 14 seater twin <b>turbo-prop</b> multi-role <b>aircraft</b> is being flight-tested with two prototype aircrafts 13; flying in parallel to accomplish the flight-testing for system and sub-system functionality. This paper 13; describes the flight test activities of SARAS in general and avionics functionality in particular. Flight trials 13; can be divided into 3 sections, planning, execution and analysis and reporting. These sections and process 13; involves meticulous planning, methodical approach towards appropriation of test functionality for each sortie, 13; efficient data capturing, effective data analysis, intelligent problem definition and result conclusion. 13; This paper covers the appropriate relevant flight test sections applicable to SARAS in accordance with the 13; FAA Advisory Circular 25 - 7 A. The avionics subsystems of SARAS are broadly classified as Communication 13; System, Navigation System, Warning System, Radar System, Display System, and Recording System.
