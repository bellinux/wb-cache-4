40|$|Predicting {{surface and}} sub-surface {{movement}} upon <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> failure {{is essential for}} safety and contingency planning. This paper {{presents the results of}} a 2 D physical and numerical modelling experiment of <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> failure in cohesionless soil. By modelling six overburden to diameter ratios, the research seeks to investigate the behaviour, magnitude and failure mechanism of a <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading.</b> The physicalmodel uses displacement control to simulate <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> movement. The use of transparent faced modelling containers allows video capture of the soil movement as the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> is displaced. From the captured video, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was then utilised to analyse soil movement. This then allowed close monitoring of the soil movement, which allows verification of settlement results and examination of failure behaviour. Numerical modelling using FLAC with FISH programming was then used for further comparison. This research concurred with past tunneling research that suggested a two stage failure mechanism, this is observable from the PIV and FLAC results. It is concluded that the current experimental and numerical procedures produce qualitative results {{that can be used to}} compare with results obtained from other research papers of the same area in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In tunnel {{construction}} process, Because monitoring points setting {{always get}} behind with <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> and occurred space effect which induces displacement loss and affects the monitoring accuracy. Studying tunnel space affect has important {{meaning to the}} monitoring data analysis. The paper takes Dalian Metro Station as research back ground, adopted three dimensional elastic-plastic numerical test method and carried out the excavation process simulation. Studied the convergence displacement and sedimentation displacement variation regulation along with the distance to <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> face. The simulation results state that the nearer to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading,</b> the displacements of surrounding rock are smaller. Analyzed the ratio of displacement loss induced by space effect and amended the monitoring displacements of Dalian Metro Station...|$|R
40|$|Applying an {{effective}} nailing system at a <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading,</b> not only improves {{the stability of}} the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> and limits deformation at the tunnel face, but it also reduces volume loss during excavation and hence reduces ground surface settlement. The effectiveness of a soil nail system is affected by many factors such as the diameter and stiffness of the nails. In this paper, a systematic parametric study was conducted to study the axial rigidity of a nail, E(n) A(n), for improving the stability of tunnel headings and reducing ground movements in stiff clay. The parametric study involved a series of three-dimensional clasto-plastic coupled-consolidation finite element analyses. The stability of the tunnel face is improved with increasing E(n) A(n). For a given nail density applied at the tunnel face, an optimum axial rigidity of the nail (E(n) A(n)) (opt) can be identified. The efficiency of the nailing system diminishes when (E(n) A(n)) (opt) is reached. The use of a soil nailing system reduces the magnitude of stress relief at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> during excavation. Thus, this reduction of stress relief minimises the amount of soil yielding and excess pore water pressure generated in the soil around the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The use of tunnels {{for various}} {{purposes}} {{has become more}} and more popular in many congested metropolitan cities worldwide. However, tunnelling may induce excessive ground movements and adverse effects on nearby structures and piles. Therefore, it is necessary and vital to gain the fundamental understanding of tunnelling-induced ground movements, the stability of <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> and <b>tunnel</b> interaction to nearby structures. In this study, three series of elasto-plastic coupled-consolidation numerical analyses were conducted to study the three-dimensional stress transfer mechanisms, ground movements, lining stresses, the stability of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> with the use of soil nails, and the influence of tunnelling on a loaded pile (including pile movements and stresses) during a “NATM” open face tunnel excavation in isotropic and anisotropic stiff clays. Based on the study of the effects of soil stiffness ratio (n = Eh'/ Ev') and coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K 0) on ground movements, it is clear that for a given K 0, the ground settlement trough becomes shallower and wider as n reduces from 1. 6 to 1. 0, whereas for a given n, the ground settlement becomes shallower and wider as K 0 increases from 0. 5 to 1. 5. Generally, a stress influence zone extends 2. 0 D in front of tunnel face and 2. 0 D behind of the tunnel face. The effects of n do not have significant influence on lining stress. However, K 0 has significant influence on the distribution of lining stress around the tunnel. The stress coefficient Kxz(= σxx'/ σzz') for soil elements rises to 1. 8 at the crown and invert, while it falls to 0. 5 at the springline immediately behind and around the tunnel face (original K 0 = 1. 0). On the other hand, the stress coefficient Kyz(= σyy'/ σzz') rises above 1. 0 for all elements around the tunnel. The changes of Kxz and Kyz demonstrate a very non-uniform stress distribution around the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> during <b>tunnel</b> excavation. The use of soil nail in a <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> does not only improve the stability of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading,</b> it also reduces surface settlements due to reduction of stress relief at tunnel face. Results show that an optimum axial rigidity of soil nail ((EnAn) opt= 300 MN in this study) for stabilizing a <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> does exist. Beyond this optimum value, the stabilizing effect does not increase further. Tunnelling-induced ground movements near a loaded existing pile do not follow a normal Gaussian distribution. Additional settlement takes place at the pile head due to the development of plastic yielding around the tunnel and pile tip. The factor of safety of the pile with a working load of 1850 kN drops from 3. 0 to 1. 5 due to tunnelling effects...|$|R

40|$|In rock {{excavation}} engineering, cutting performance prediction {{plays an important}} role in machine and cutting tool design. In the past, experimental and theoretical studies on the interaction between rock and TBM tools were conducted for the explanation of the intimate mechanism of rock failure and to obtain knowledge that was able to improve the performances of the TBMs. Nevertheless,, despite several decades of academic rock mechanics and practical rock engineering, there is still a lack of some fundamental knowledge on rock-tool interaction. The objective of this paper is to evaluate a model that predicts the distributed displacement and stresses under a TBM disk, taking into account, in the failure mode, the constitutive law of the rock, the presence of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>head,</b> the amount of the natural stress due to the high overburden, and the forces caused by the TBM disk on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>head.</b> Some laboratory tests were also planned to validate the theoretical results...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} three-dimensional, numerical, elastoplastic, coupled-consolidation {{analyses}} {{was conducted to}} investigate {{the effects of the}} stiffness ratio (n = E'(h) /E'(v)) and the initial coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K- 0) on ground deformations and stress-transfer mechanisms due to idealized open-face tunnelling (i. e., New Austrian Tunnelling Method or NATM) at a given unsupported length. As n increases, smaller plastic extension strain zones are mobilized at the crown and invert for a given K- 0, leading to a deeper and narrower transverse surface settlement trough. On the other hand, for a given n, the lower the initial K- 0 is, the deeper and narrower the computed settlement trough will be. Three-dimensional stress-transfer mechanisms at a <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> are demonstrated through the changes in normal stresses and induced shear stresses around the tunnel. As the tunnel excavation advances, the maximum total normal stress reduction in the lateral direction (Delta sigma(xx)) and in the vertical direction (Delta sigma(zz)) occurs at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading,</b> whereas the largest total normal stress reduction in the longitudinal direction (Delta sigma(yy)) takes place at about 0. 5 D (D = diameter) ahead of the tunnel face. A total stress reduction zone can be identified within 2. 0 D ahead of the tunnel face, and the stress influence zone diminishes at a distance of about 1. 0 D beyond the tunnel face. A significant reduction in pore-water pressure, of up to about 75 % of its initial value, can be identified around the <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading.</b> Around a <b>tunnel</b> open face, the effective stress coefficient K-xz (= sigma' (xx) /sigma' (zz)) and K-yz (= sigma' (yy) /sigma' (zz)) rise to approximately 1. 8 and more than 2. 0 at the crown and invert in the initial K- 0 = 1. 0 ground conditions, respectively. On the other hand, K-xz falls to about 50 % of the initial K- 0 value at the springline, and the coefficient at the shoulder and heel drops to between 10 % and 20 %...|$|R

40|$|This project {{involves}} the investigation, development and verification of two numerical models aimed at predicting the settlement profiles {{caused by the}} process of underground tunnelling in soft cohesion less soils using the computer program Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC). The numerical models created will investigate the settlement profiles caused by the tunnelling process from a transverse and longitudinal cross sectional view using a relaxation process employed in FLAC. Any major problems that arose during the model development will be analysed, discussed any the possible remedies will either be discussed for future work or applied where possible. The basic approach of this project was to research the two situations under investigation, develop the appropriate models in FLAC, verify these models though comparison with reputable published paper and analyse the results from a series of parametric studies. The main focus of the investigation was to develop new models for the two problems utilising a relaxation technique employed in FLAC. Few problems were encountered in the development of these models – mainly from the ability of FLAC to accurately model cohesion less soil structures. The completion of this project has adequately demonstrated that FLAC is able to be utilized to develop models for the two different <b>tunnel</b> <b>heading</b> profiles.
