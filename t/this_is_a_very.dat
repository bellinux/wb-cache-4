5|$|Vertebral artery dissection, {{a tear in}} {{the arteries}} in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from {{rotation}} of the neck while the neck is extended. This can occur {{in a variety of}} contexts, but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> serious condition which can result in a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|Six {{vascular}} {{plants are}} {{unique in that}} they are at the extreme edge of their range or are disjunct from the main range of their species. They are the Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes L.), in Minnesota six small populations of 20 to 40 plants have been found in the Rove area; Ross's (or Short) sedge (Carex rossii), only three populations are known to exist in the Rove area; Large-leaved sandwort (Moehringia macrophylla or Arenaria macrophylla), evidence indicates that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare species with limited distribution and restrictive environmental needs; Sticky locoweed (Oxytropis borealis var. viscida), is restricted to a single cliff in Cook County; Encrusted saxifrage (Saxifraga paniculata ssp. neogaea), 11 populations are known to exist in the Rove formation; and Smooth Woodsia (Woodsia glabella), there are small, isolated populations in the Rove Formation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, MacNeish {{discovered}} the Coxcatlan Cave in Puebla, Mexico. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important site of early maize domestication.|$|R
50|$|I think {{everyone}} present sensed that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant {{event for the}} Aboriginal community, and the considerable number of Redfern 'Koories' present bore this out.|$|R
30|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{positive}} result as {{it helped to}} validate the underlying idea of implementing <b>an</b> AAL system <b>were</b> older people carrying out interactions with an Adaptive Interface.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that this}} series {{can be summed}} for a given value of n, or when n is ∞. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> general formula, which leads to several {{important}} special cases given below.|$|E
25|$|The third method {{requires}} multiple perfect matches {{which are}} {{in close proximity to}} each other. As Kent shows, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective technique capable of taking into consideration small insertions and deletions within the homologous regions.|$|E
25|$|In this gait, {{the horse}} moves its legs in unison in {{diagonal}} pairs. From {{the standpoint of}} the balance of the horse, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> stable gait, and the horse need not make major balancing motions with its head and neck.|$|E
50|$|Cassavetes said <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{personal}} {{film for}} him, having known very well {{the effect of}} losing someone close after his older brother {{died at the age}} of 30.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Romans built a road {{spanning}} Aquileia, Emona, Atrans and Celeia. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important road, military, {{post and}} market place, {{and the town}} <b>was</b> surrounded by <b>a</b> defensive wall.|$|R
30|$|Discussion: <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{interesting}} {{patient with}} congenital abnormalities complicated by a bladder nodule that infiltrated full thickness into the bladder and had intestinal metaplasia. The uterine defect was repaired in 2 surgeries.|$|R
25|$|Regurgitation {{through the}} aortic valve, if marked, is {{sometimes}} audible to a practiced ear {{with a high}} quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope. Generally, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rarely heard murmur, even though aortic valve regurgitation is not so rare. Aortic regurgitation, though obvious using echocardiography visualization, usually does not produce an audible murmur.|$|E
25|$|Description: Stylistically {{similar to}} the {{dramatic}} mezzo, just lower. Sings usually around the break between the chest-voice and middle-voice. Many mezzos tried their luck in these roles, yet real altos fare better. A deep, penetrating low female voice. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare voice type with a darker, richer sound {{than that of a}} typical alto.|$|E
25|$|Between 1901 and 1911, Columbia University {{produced}} seven PhDs in anthropology. Although by today's standards <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small number, at {{the time}} it was sufficient to establish Boas's Anthropology Department at Columbia as the preeminent anthropology program in the country. Moreover, many of Boas's students went on to establish anthropology programs at other major universities.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} Any Given Sunday (1999) there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> scene with actor Jamie Foxx wearing a jockstrap {{in the locker}} room. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{successful}} example of product placement by company Under Armour ...|$|R
50|$|Greg and Elizabeth Kent {{were also}} early breeders, who {{developed}} their own line of Bengals using ALCs and Egyptian Maus. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful line and many modern Bengals will find it in their pedigree.|$|R
50|$|Chile {{never reached}} {{the status of}} <b>a</b> viceroyalty and <b>was</b> instead {{classified}} as a captaincy general because <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> warlike territory and thus <b>was</b> ruled by <b>a</b> military and not a nobleman like a viceroy.|$|R
25|$|In Norway {{district}} heating only constitutes approximately 2% of energy needs for heating. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low number compared to similar countries. One {{of the main}} reasons {{district heating}} has a low penetration in Norway is access to cheap hydro-based electricity, and 80% of private electricity consumption goes to heat rooms and water. However, there is district heating in the major cities.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century {{there was}} an {{explosion}} of interest in the Claddagh Ring, both as jewelry and as an icon of Irish identity. In recent years it has been embellished with interlace designs and combined with other Celtic and Irish symbols, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> recent phenomenon that corresponds with the worldwide expansion in popularity of the Claddagh ring as an emblem of Irish identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{diatonic}} scale appears in writing throughout history, consisting of seven tones in each octave. In just intonation the {{diatonic scale}} may be easily constructed using the three simplest intervals within the octave, the perfect fifth (3/2), perfect fourth (4/3), {{and the major}} third (5/4). As forms of the fifth and third are naturally present in the overtone series of harmonic resonators, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple process.|$|E
50|$|Albert Orsborn's first wife, Captain Evalina Barker, died in 1942. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{hard time}} for him. Two years later, in 1944, he married his second wife, Major Evelyn Berry. They were married {{for just a}} year when she died.|$|R
50|$|Home ground {{transferred}} from Albert Park to Flinders Park, Batman Avenue. Now known as Melbourne Park, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> central location, with dual changing facilities, which also serviced Old Scotch Collegians at their adjacent oval. Despite some shortcomings in the facilities such as coldness generated from open mesh windows and door etc. <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> convenient location which served the Club well until 1978 {{when there were}} plans to completely redevelop this quarter of Melbourne. The Club would ultimately {{give way to the}} building of the Rod Laver Arena, which is now situated on this hallowed turf, and move back to Albert Park, which would prove to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long term tenancy for the Club.|$|R
50|$|During late October {{and early}} November 1999, during the spacecraft's post-Braille {{encounter}} coast phase, Deep Space 1 observed Mars with its MICAS instrument. Although <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> distant flyby, the instrument did succeed in taking multiple infrared spectra of the planet.|$|R
25|$|Clerids have a minor {{significance}} in forensic entomology. Some species are occasionally found on carrion {{in the later}} dry stages of decay. Also, some species are pests (stored product entomology) and are found infesting various food products. Research efforts related to Cleridae have focused primarily on using certain species as biological controls. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective technique for controlling bark beetles due to the voracious appetite of many clerid species.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{the diverse}} and {{important}} role helper T cells {{play in the}} immune system, {{it is not surprising}} that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the helper T cell response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare occurrence.|$|E
25|$|Though {{it just a}} {{particular}} case of a moving particle, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important one for {{its relationship with the}} rigid body study, and special tools have been developed for this case. There are two possible ways to describe the angular velocity of a rotating frame: the angular velocity vector and the angular velocity tensor. Both entities are related and they can be calculated from each other.|$|E
50|$|Ballygunner beat De La Salle {{to win the}} 2005 Waterford Hurling Championship. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} {{victory for}} the club as defeat would have meant their fourth straight loss in the County Final, having lost the previously three finals to Mount Sion.|$|R
50|$|A review {{published}} on 11 August 1900 in the Academy calls the latest installment of Marsh’s then periodical, “red-hot melodrama.” It also asserts {{that it is}} “capital reading for Margate.” <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> harsh comment on the novel as the Academy included high-culture.|$|R
50|$|Brookhart favored {{dramatically}} increasing Prohibition enforcement appropriations by 240 million dollars. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unpopular {{position because}} of widespread unemployment and underemployment during the Great Depression. Those favoring repeal argued that legalizing alcoholic beverages would {{stimulate the economy}} and provide desperately needed tax revenue.|$|R
25|$|Any link admits such a description, and it {{is clear}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> compact {{notation}} even for very large crossing number. There are some further shorthands usually used. The last example is usually written 8*3:2 0, where the ones are omitted and kept the number of dots excepting the dots at the end. For an algebraic knot such as in the first example, 1* is often omitted.|$|E
25|$|The {{sulfanilamide}} compound is {{more active}} in the protonated form. The drug has very low solubility and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> painful experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water. Newer analogous compounds prevent this complication {{because they have a}} lower pKa, around 5–6, making them more likely to remain in a soluble form.|$|E
25|$|Single brand {{retailing}} attracted 94 proposals between 2006 and 2010, {{of which}} 57 were approved and implemented. For {{a country of}} 1.2 billion people, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small number. Some claim {{one of the primary}} restraint inhibiting better participation was that India required single brand retailers to limit their ownership in Indian outlets to 51%. China in contrast allows 100% ownership by foreign companies in both single brand and multi-brand retail presence.|$|E

Here, we consider the phase space T^*X equipped with the standard measure dxdξ where X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> manifold. 4 <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important step since it connected the sharp spectral asymptotics with classical dynamics.|$|R
50|$|Before Dow {{got into}} the bromine business, brine was {{evaporated}} by heating with wood scraps and then crystallized sodium chloride was removed.
