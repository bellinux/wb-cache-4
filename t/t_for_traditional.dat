Political stability emerges from the perceptions of the likelihood that the government will not be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitut ional or violent means, including domestic violence and terrorism. Civil conflicts can lead to the destruction of limited resources, economic infrastructure, institutions of political stability and governance, and ethnic and social fabric. Public services are failing the poor in most countries making building public confidence in e-Government remain an agenda item for the countries. Nigerian Governments have been consistent ly facing challenges to reposition, reinvent, and realign themselves in light of increasing expectations for demonstrable results and enhanced responsiveness for a more cost effective, citizen-centric, and networked government evidenced by several incessant conflicts arising from marginalization of grassroots communities. Access to primary and authentic source of information at the grassroots is key to transparent and responsive government. The ICTs suppor <b>t</b> <b>for</b> <b>traditional</b> governance i...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{looked at}} attendance capacity <b>for</b> <b>traditional</b> and non-traditional hockey markets. The {{aim was to}} attempt {{to determine the extent}} the attendance capacities differed between the two markets. Previously, there had not been any quantitative analyses done comparing traditional and non-traditional hockey markets so this study aimed to add new knowledge to that area. The National Hockey League (NHL) grapples with the validity of some of the current markets, with many observers calling for some teams to relocate to new markets. This research aimed to attempt to determine how justified those criticisms were. Kim, Trail, & Magnusen (2013) have previously correlated fan identity to attendance motivation, but not in hockey. Attendance figures were compiled for the 2005 through 2011 seasons including pre and post All-Star Break. Also compiled were wins, goals scored, goals allowed, and fighting majors to attempt to find predictors of attendance. A stratified sample was used, dividing the teams into the two previously discussed markets. An F <b>Test</b> <b>for</b> ANOVA was run to find a statistical difference in attendance capacities <b>for</b> <b>traditional</b> markets versus non-traditional markets. Additionally, an Independent T-Test was run to find post All-Star Break attendances were significantly higher than pre All-Star Break attendances. Finally, a multiple regression determined none of the above variables were good indicators of attendance. This study laid groundwork fo...|$|R
