5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested <b>that,</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

25|$|In New York City, jazz was fused with stride (an {{advanced}} form of ragtime) {{and became}} highly evolved, {{notably in the}} compositions of James P. Johnson in the 1920s. Fletcher Henderson's jazz orchestra, first appearing in 1923 and including Coleman Hawkins (and later New Orleans musician Louis Armstrong) became wildly popular and helped invent swing music. Though Henderson {{was among the first}} major New York jazz musicians, he was not as able to adapt to the rapidly changing style as some of his contemporaries, such as Duke Ellington. When Ellington moved to New York City, he inaugurated a legion of jazz musicians <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> same and moved the center of jazz's development from Chicago to New York.|$|E

25|$|Because of his {{prominent}} role in Chinese diplomacy in Korea and strong political connections in Manchuria, Li found himself directing Chinese forces during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895. In fact, it was mostly the armies that he established and controlled <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> fighting, whereas other Chinese troops led by his political rivals {{did not come to}} their aid. Rampant corruption further weakened the Chinese military. For instance, one official misappropriated ammunition funds for personal use. As a result, shells ran out during battle, forcing one navy captain, Deng Shichang, to resort to ordering his ship to ram an enemy ship. The defeat of Li's modernised armed forces by the Japanese undermined his political standing, as well as the wider cause of the Self-Strengthening Movement.|$|E
25|$|Maclagan {{opened the}} batting for England, and made 72 {{before she was}} the fifth woman out with England on 116, just before close on the first day. On day two, England moved on to 154, with Betty Archdale making 32 not out. In their second innings, Australia fared better, and were 99 for 5 at close on the second day. Maclagan failed to take a wicket in her 28 overs, but it was Mary Spear's five wickets <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> damage, as the home team were all of for 138, a total which {{included}} 63 runs scored over {{more than four hours}} from Essie Shevill. England were thus set just 32 for the win, which they secured with the loss of just one wicket.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 {{indeed it}} was started the Italian {{colonization}} of the area of Genale, in southern Somalia, forming a group of small and medium-sized farms. Most settlers consisted of old fascist militants of Turin who had followed in this Italian colony the new governor of Somalia, Cesare Maria De Vecchi. The first informal association between farmers, however, arose only in 1928. The main crop of the area was cotton and was done by small farms owned by those Italian settlers: about one hundred with an area varying between 75 and 600 hectares (with an average that oscillated about 200) with a total area of about 20,000 hectares. At least until 1931 the cotton was the main crop, later replaced by the banana production, whose harvest was sold to the Italian State, <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> marketing in Italy as a monopoly.|$|E

500|$|Planetarian is Key's fourth visual novel, {{and had a}} small {{staff of}} three main people <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of the work for the game's first release. Unlike previous Key titles, Planetarians art director position was given to Eeji Komatsu instead of Itaru Hinoue who had held the position for the three previous games. Komatsu was chosen {{not only because of}} his specialty in depicting mechanics and robots, but also because he could represent short scenes which touch on a robot's existence to reproduce a person's ideals. Furthermore, Key was not short on staff at the time, and was not forced to outsource the artwork of Planetarian. Jun Maeda, Key's main scenario writer and project planner, was left out of the project, and Yūichi Suzumoto was given the position of planning and scenario. The music, excluding a single piece composed by Shinji Orito, was arranged or composed entirely by Magome Togoshi, one of Key's signature composers. Planetarian was the first game under the brand name KineticNovel to be described by the term [...] "kinetic novel".|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 May the theatre was packed. Gustav Linor reported, [...] "Never... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the {{stairways}} and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew in a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in [...] "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, [...] "it was not Stravinsky's music <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." [...] Marie Rambert, who was working {{as an assistant to}} Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into [...] "a terrific uproar" [...] which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers. The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement, and [...] "began to beat rhythmically on top of my head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.|$|E
