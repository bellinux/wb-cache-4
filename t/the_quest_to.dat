5|$|Final Fantasy VIII is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Square for the PlayStation console. Released in 1999, it is the eighth main installment in the Final Fantasy series. Set on an unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows {{a group of young}} mercenaries, led by Squall Leonhart, as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by the sorceress Edea. After defeating Edea, the protagonists learn that she was under the control of Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time. During <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> defeat Ultimecia, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly.|$|E
5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of labor in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E
5|$|New {{airspeed}} {{records were}} set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using the R engine. In {{the two decades}} before World War II, <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> break the land speed record was hotly contested, particularly so in the early 1930s. Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high power-to-weight ratios: the Liberty engine, Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among the engine types used in the 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R was the latest development in high-powered aero engine design at the time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; the engine was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.|$|E

5|$|The Hero leaves {{their home}} country of Aliahan to travel the world and {{complete}} their father's quest to defeat Baramos. A major portion of the adventure is <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> acquire the last {{two of the three}} keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar and stealing back the King of Romaly's crown, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which they then trade for a sailing ship at Portoga. With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia. Ramia allows the Hero and their party to travel to Baramos' castle, which is surrounded by mountains.|$|E
5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> unlock the Onion Knight. An interruption-save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there is no way to make permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E

25|$|The English {{side had}} lost the {{previous}} tour to Australia, but had remained undefeated at home by visiting Australian sides.

The English media then dubbed the next English tour to Australia in 1882–83 as <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> regain The Ashes.|$|E

25|$|The first cyclotron, {{an early}} type of {{particle}} accelerator, {{was built by}} Ernest O.

As accelerators have grown, so too has the list of known particles that they might be used to investigate.
