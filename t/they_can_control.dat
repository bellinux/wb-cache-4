25|$|Early use of augmentative and {{alternative}} communication systems may assist {{the child in}} developing spoken language skills. Overall language delay is associated with problems of intellectual disability, deafness, and learned helplessness. Children with cerebral palsy {{are at risk of}} learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators, initiating little communication. Early intervention with this clientele, and their parents, often targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> people and objects in their environment through this communication, including making choices, decisions, and mistakes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological monitoring of kelp forests before, during, and after such disturbances, scientists try to tease apart {{the intricacies of}} kelp forest dynamics using experimental manipulations. By working on smaller spatial-temporal scales, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> for {{the presence or absence}} of specific biotic and abiotic factors to discover the operative mechanisms. For example, in southern Australia, manipulations of kelp canopy types demonstrated that the relative amount of Ecklonia radiata in a canopy could be used to predict understory species assemblages; consequently, the proportion of E. radiata can be used as an indicator of other species occurring in the environment.|$|E

25|$|Star Fleet Battles is a ship-to-ship warfare {{simulation}} game, {{which uses}} cardboard counters {{to represent the}} ships, shuttles, seeking weapons, terrain, and information on a hexagonal map. It {{is not simply a}} game, but rather a detailed game system for two or more players (there are some solitaire scenarios). Typically, a player will have one ship in a game, though <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> an entire fleet, if they can keep track of the paperwork and options involved; multiple players can play as teams, with each team splitting up the work of running a squadron or fleet, or a 'free-for-all' fight can be run. Ships represented in the game are typically starships from such classic Star Trek powers as the Federation, Romulan Star Empire, Klingon Empire, or purely Star Fleet Universe creations such as the Hydran Kingdom or Interstellar Concordium.|$|E
25|$|As in Peace Walker, The Phantom Pain {{features}} a base-building {{system that allows}} players to develop weapons and items from their home base. Recruitment of enemy soldiers and prisoners has also returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app. Unlike in Peace Walker where players can only see Mother Base from the air, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, an item introduced into gameplay in Peace Walker, returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother Base. Money for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology can be collected from objects found all over the map, such as diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes, as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested on upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his AI companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a drone.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, after {{a two-year}} debate on a {{proposal}} from Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) agreed to explore ways of reducing emissions from deforestation and to enhance forest carbon stocks in developing nations. The underlying idea is that developing nations should be financially compensated if they succeed in reducing their levels of deforestation (through valuing the carbon that is stored in forests); a concept termed 'avoided deforestation (AD) or, REDD if broadened to include reducing forest degradation (see Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). Under the free market model advocated by the countries who have formed the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, developing nations with rainforests would sell carbon sink credits under a free market system to Kyoto Protocol Annex I states who have exceeded their emissions allowance. Brazil (the state with the largest area of tropical rainforest) however, opposes including avoided deforestation in a carbon trading mechanism and instead favors creation of a multilateral development assistance fund created from donations by developed states. For REDD to be successful science and regulatory infrastructure related to forests will need to increase so nations may inventory all their forest carbon, show that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> land use {{at the local level}} and prove that their emissions are declining.|$|E

2500|$|... (1973) was an {{adaptation}} of the Marquis de Sade's Justine (1791). Jasper Sharp writes that Kumashiro uses de Sade's story as a platform for criticizing morality imposed by power, with particular relevance to the censorship trial Nikkatsu was undergoing at the time with the prosecution of Love Hunter (1972). Underlying this theme, common in Kumashiro's work, Kumashiro has one of his characters say, [...] "What you accept as ethical is contrived by those in authority so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> people." [...] Kumashiro also employs censorship {{as one of the}} stylistic devices of the film, exaggerating the fogging required by Japanese law by placing black blocks over large areas of the screen.|$|E
2500|$|Slow {{motion in}} Ray's levels is called [...] "{{concentration}} mode". To enter this mode, Ray must holster {{both of his}} six shooters. During combat, when he draws either one, concentration mode is automatically activated, and the game goes into slow motion, with two targeting reticles appearing {{on either side of}} the screen, with each moving towards the center. The player cannot control the movement of either reticle, or move their character during concentration mode, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the positioning of the screen, allowing them to maneuver Ray's vision so as to position the reticles over an enemy. They can also shoot independently from either their left or right gun, or both simultaneously. Ray's levels also involve numerous gun duels between Ray and one or more enemies. In these shootouts, the player must wait for a countdown, at which point the enemy will reach for their weapon. Only then can Ray draw his own gun and fire. Movement during duels is limited to leaning left and right.|$|E
5000|$|Oil, Minerals, and Grain are {{the three}} {{resources}} in the game. Players draw resource cards on the prospect stage to determine which mines, farms, and oilfields <b>they</b> <b>control,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>control</b> resources in other superpower territories if they have invaded and occupied said territory. This ignites many conflicts because players need resources to build and move military units, fight battles, and control the population, earn money on the [...] "Sell to Market" [...] stage, upgrade their technology, and defend their country. Each superpower may control up to twelve units of each resource, if they defeat and subsequently occupy an enemy superpower <b>they</b> <b>can</b> take <b>control</b> of their supply center and have up to 24 of each resource. Additional units may be sold on the world market.|$|R

2500|$|Just as the prana-bindu {{allows the}} Bene Gesserit to {{precisely}} control each muscle and nerve, {{they also have}} complete conscious control over the functions of their internal organs and body chemistry. [...] A Sister can completely control her breathing and heart rate {{to the degree that}} she can appear dead to most tests even after intense physical exertion. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> their need for food and water to the extremes of hunger and thirst, and even commit suicide at will by simply stopping their hearts or shutting down their brains. The Bene Gesserit are therefore immune to poisons, as they can simply change the chemical makeup of any harmful substance in their body and render it harmless. It is hinted that should a Bene Gesserit wish to, she could slow her aging process dramatically, controlling every aspect of her metabolism. Of course, no Bene Gesserit would ever do this, as it would call too much attention to the Sisterhood and reveal too much of their abilities. In Children of Dune, Jessica realizes that her daughter Alia has done this, which is her first sign that her daughter is sinking into Abomination.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of slow motion attacks in the game, called [...] "Concentration mode." [...] Ray and Thomas' concentrations modes are charged by killing enemies, with headshots charging their meters faster than body shots. However, once the player has filled their concentration meter, they have only sixty seconds in which to activate it, or it empties by half, and they must recharge it. In Ray's mode, once slow motion begins, Ray is free to rotate 360 degrees from a fixed position. If the crosshairs pass over an enemy, that enemy will be [...] "tagged". Up to twelve enemies in total can be tagged (or less than twelve enemies can be tagged multiple times, up {{to a total of}} twelve tags) during concentration mode, but the amount of time the player has to do so is limited (indicated by an on-screen meter). Once the time is up, Ray fires at all tagged enemies with perfect accuracy. In Thomas' concentration mode, the player does not need to manually aim. Instead, the crosshairs automatically moves from visible enemy to visible enemy, pausing on each one momentarily. As the crosshairs moves, the player must hold down a button permanently, and when the crosshairs pause, the player must pull back on the analog stick or move the mouse backwards to fire at the target (mimicking the action of real-life fanning). The third type of concentration mode is dual concentration, which happens automatically at certain points of the game, always at doorways. Ray and Thomas simultaneously burst into the room, and the game goes into slow motion. Two targeting reticles appear {{on either side of the}} screen, with each moving towards the center. The player cannot control the movement of either reticle, or move their character during concentration mode, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the positioning of the screen, allowing them to maneuver the character's vision so as to position the reticles over an enemy. They can also shoot independently from either their left or right gun, or both simultaneously.|$|E
6000|$|The Dred Scott {{decision}} expressly gives {{every citizen}} of the United States a right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories. And now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, {{that the people of}} the Territory could lawfully drive slavery out again. When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was cleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare absurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be. Clear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay. Well, it was because the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery. He does not say so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he made here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he has never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery. He desires that you, who wish the Territories to remain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does not say it himself. He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have stated, by changing his language entirely. What he says now is something different in language, and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too. It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the Constitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the Territories beyond the power {{of the people of the}} Territories to control it as other property. He does not say the people can drive it out, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> it as other property. The language is different; we should consider whether the sense is different. Driving a horse out of this lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about; it is putting him on the other side of the fence. Or it might be a sort of exclusion of him from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him; but neither of these things is the same as [...] "controlling him as other property." [...] That would be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use and abuse him, to make the most money out of him, [...] "as other property"; but, please you, what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more than this? What do they really want, other than that slavery, being in the Territories, shall be controlled as other property? If they want anything else, I do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, first, for the purpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge has made; and, in the second place, the importance of the change,--that that change is not such as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power to exclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the judge sometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property by unfriendly legislation they may control it to death; as you might, in the case of a horse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much that he would die. But when you come to legislative control, there is something more to be attended to. I have no doubt, myself, that if the Territories should undertake to control slave property as other property that is, control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as property, and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens as property, really deal with it as property,--the Supreme Court of the United States will say, [...] "God speed you, and amen." [...] But I undertake to give the opinion, at least, that if the Territories attempt by any direct legislation to drive the man with his slave out of the Territory, or to decide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there, or to tax him to such an extent that he cannot keep him there, the Supreme Court will unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional, as long as that Supreme Court is constructed as the Dred Scott Supreme Court is. The first two things they have already decided, except that there is a little quibble among lawyers between the words [...] "dicta" [...] and [...] "decision." [...] They have already decided a negro cannot be made free by Territorial legislation.|$|E
