5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail <b>transit,</b> <b>mail</b> service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, the Sectional Center {{concept of}} <b>transit</b> <b>mail</b> service was announced, {{along with the}} {{introduction}} of a ZIP Code on mail to facilitate mechanized processing. The ZIP Code made it possible to distribute all mail by numbers with machines holding the routing associated for each address. This {{was a far cry from}} the knowledge that was necessary before when Mobile Unit distribution clerks were expected to know the routing for several thousand post offices in their assignment. There was no place in the new set-up for an RPO service.|$|E

50|$|The Postal Transportation Service (PTS) was the renamed {{successor}} to the Railway Mail Service of the United States Post Office Department from 1 October 1949. Although this branch of the service had {{been in charge of}} all <b>transit</b> <b>mail,</b> some parts {{had little to do with}} railroads, even though they were still the most important part of the service. In 1950, of the 32,000 clerks assigned to the PTS, only about 16,000 actually worked on trains. The remainder were in terminals, transfer offices, Air Mail Facility, Highway Post Offices (HPO), administrative offices, etc. Boat Railway Post Office (Boat RPO), Streetcar Railway Post Offices, and the Seapost Service had already been discontinued. The name of the Chief Clerk's office was changed to District Superintendent's office.|$|E

50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the first air-mail route in 1918, and the later additional routes, plus the accepted use of premium priced air mail by the public, it was only natural that the Railway Mail Service (RMS), being in charge of <b>transit</b> <b>mail,</b> was assigned the task of establishing Air Mail Field (AMF) postal facilities at the major airports. Only outgoing air mail was distributed at these workrooms, channeled there by both the post offices and Railway Post Office (RPO) routes. This mail was distributed and dispatched to other AMFs via the different flight connections. Incoming mail from other AMFs was distributed by general scheme and pouched to outgoing RPOs and necessary post offices. The Motor Vehicle Service provided frequent trips between the city post office and the AMF for air mail ground transportation. In 1951, there were 1200 clerks manning forty AMFs. They continue to exist within the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and are now called Air Mail Centers (AMCs).|$|E
50|$|Areas within Amherst are {{referred}} to by the former post office station names and are not legally incorporated. During the 1990s, many of these regional post offices were closed and consolidated into the central Amherst 14226 post office on Bailey Avenue, leaving only a Williamsville (14221) post office on Sheridan Drive, a Getzville (14068) post office on Millersport Highway, and an East Amherst (14051) post office on <b>Transit</b> Road. <b>Mailing</b> addresses to areas within the town are Amherst, East Amherst, Eggertsville, Getzville, Snyder, and Williamsville. These postal districts are still recognized by {{the post office and}} widely referred to by citizens.|$|R

50|$|Portpatrick, on {{the western}} side of the Rinns, had long served as a port for a short sea route from Donaghadee in the north of Ireland.

Later <b>mail</b> <b>transit</b> for the Post Office mails developed, by 1838 8,000 to 10,000 letters passed through the port daily, brought by coach from both Dumfries and Glasgow.|$|R

50|$|With {{the help}} of the Nasser trading family, the Nairn Transport Company was {{established}} and the first official trip made on 18 October 1923. The new arrangements cut the <b>transit</b> time for <b>mail</b> from Baghdad to Europe to around 10 days from the 30 days previously required. Mail had previously travelled by ship from Port Said, via the Suez Canal, around the Arab Peninsula to the port of Basrah and then by rail to Baghdad.|$|R
5000|$|In 1497, {{on behalf}} of Emperor Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire, Franz von Taxis {{established}} a postal service that replaced the ad-hoc courier for official mail. A horse relay system was created that shortened the <b>transit</b> time for <b>mail</b> and made its arrival predictable. Thereafter, the house of Thurn und Taxis using the imperial yellow and black livery maintained the postal privilege for many centuries. The Thurn-und-Taxis-Post employed the first horse-drawn mail coaches in Europe since Roman times in 1650, - they started {{in the town of}} Kocs giving rise to the term [...] "coach".|$|R
5000|$|The APS {{provided}} {{mail collection}} and distribution facilities, sold stamps, postal orders and postal stationary, as well as, providing a Telegram service. The <b>transit</b> time for <b>mail</b> between the UK and BEF was 3-4 days. During the 'Phoney War' period a 'cross post' operation was laid for intra-formation mail, the service also carried {{most of the}} Royal Signals Despatch Rider Letter Service (DRLS) material. The APS handled an average of 9,000 mailbags a day. As part of the [...] "Plan D" [...] the Base APO was moved to Le Havre and a Regulating Post Office was established at Bolougne to receive mails from Folkestone. This improved the transit time to 2-3 days.|$|R
50|$|The APS {{continued}} to re-organise itself {{to meet the}} challenges of the changing tactical situation and an increase in troop levels on the Western Front. Packet boat connections were introduced between Folkestone and Boulogne where a BAPO was established in January, which improved the <b>transit</b> times for <b>mails</b> from 4 days to 2 days. In his dispatch of 5 April 1915 the CinC, Sir John French, put the high quality of the postal service on official records when he reported that:The Army Postal Service has {{continued to}} work well and at the present time a letter posted in London is delivered at GHQ or at Headquarters of Army or Corps on the following evening and reaches an addressee in the trenches on the second day of posting. The delivery of parcels has also been accelerated and is carried out with regularity and dispatch.|$|R
5000|$|During the Retreat from Mons (24 August - 4 September) the FPOs {{move back}} with their {{respective}} formations. When the German’s push to Paris threatened the British {{lines of communication}} the Advance BAPO at Amiens moved westward to Rouen (27 August) then to Le Mans (31 August) then to Villeneuve-Saint-Georges and finally to Abbeville (14 October) By the time the Advance BAPO reached Abbeville it had moved four times in 50 days and had journeyed over 460 miles using trains as well as horse and cart. [...] Likewise between 1-4 September the BAPO moved from Le Havre to Nantes where it was re-opened. Once the military situation stablished after the battle of Marne the BAPO was moved back to Havre and opened for work on 27 September. It remained in Le Havre {{for the rest of}} the war. Service improvements came with the BAPO’s return to Le Havre as a dedicated daily packet ship was instituted between Southampton and the BAPO reducing the <b>mail</b> <b>transit</b> time from the UK to the soldier in the front line from ten days to four.|$|R
40|$|The {{use by the}} Post Office of {{riders and}} carts for mail {{conveyance}} on main post routes was by c 170 proving deficient {{as a means of}} distributing intelligence for an economy about to undergo sustained and rapid economic developments. The appearance of fast light stage-coaches on certain roads at this time however, provided the inspiration for John Palmer to advance his plan for a system of mail-coaches. Despite opposition, Palmer had in a period of less than two years established a network of mail-coach services which provided an economical and safe means of <b>mail</b> <b>transit</b> coupled with a premier form of public passenger conveyance. The speed and expansion of routes and facilities resulted initially in a rapid increase in the volume of letters, but this declined as postage rates increased to assist war financiers, and from 1812 stagnation set in. The number of mail-coaches was never large and {{at the height of the}} system in the mid 1830 s only 300 vehicles were used in Great Britain and another 75 in Ireland, but their success stimulated coaching in general. By the min 1830 s mail-coaching produced demand factors in the economy amounting to about £ 700, 000 per annum in Great Britain and £ 120, 000 in Ireland of which the agricultural sector received 70...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{communication}} {{across the}} primary/secondary interface {{is vital for}} the planning and delivery of appropriate patient care throughout the cancer patient journey. This study describes GPs’ views of the communication issues across the primary/secondary interface in relation to ovarian cancer patients using qualitative interviews with purposively sampled general practitioners (GPs) and an audit of hospital medical records of 30 deceased ovarian cancer patients. Issues raised by the GPs related to the content and format of communications, but of most concern was the tardiness. The time lag between dictation and typing letters ranged from 0 to 27 days, with a delay of up to 8 days for signing before <b>transit</b> through various <b>mail</b> systems to the GP. Three stages in the patient journey were characterized by particular issues: (1) in the pre-diagnostic and diagnostic stage {{was a need for}} prompt information regarding the results of tests and diagnoses, and clearer guidance on the use of tests and fast-track referrals; (2) in the active treatment phase, when GPs could lose touch with their patients, they needed effective communication in order to provide moral support and crisis management; and (3) when oncology withdrew and the focus of care switched back to the community for the terminal phase, GPs needed information to enable them to pick up the baton of care. There is a need to develop and evaluate interventions aimed at improving the content and speed of communications between secondary and primary care. Such interventions are likely to be complex and might include the greater use of telephone or fax for more selected communications, a review of secretarial support, the use of email, the development of GP designed proformas, the feasibility of patient/carer letter delivery options, nurse-led communication, universal electronic patient records, or a revisiting of the patient-held record...|$|R
60|$|In {{the year}} ended June 30, 1861, the gross revenue of the post- office of the States was, as I have stated, 1,700,000l. In the same year its {{expenditure}} was in round figures 2,720,000l.; consequently there was an actual loss, to be made up out of general taxation, amounting to 1,020,000l. In the accounts of the American officers this is lessened by 140,000l. That sum having been arbitrarily fixed by the government as the amount earned by the post-office in carrying free mail matter. We have a similar system in computing {{the value of the}} service rendered by our post-office to the government in carrying government dispatches; but with us the amount named as the compensation depends on the actual weight carried. If the matter so carried be carried solely on the government service, as is, I believe, the case with us, any such claim on behalf of the post-office is apparently unnecessary. The Crown works for the Crown, as the right hand works for the left. The post-office pays no rates or taxes, contributes nothing to the poor, runs its mails on turnpike roads free of toll, and gives receipts on unstamped paper. With us no payment is in truth made, though the post-office in its accounts presumes itself to have received the money; but in the States the sum named is handed over by the State Treasury to the Post-office Treasury. Any such statement of credit does not in effect alter the real fact that over a million sterling is required as a subsidy by the American post-office, in order that it may be enabled to pay its way. In estimating the expenditure of the office the department at Washington debits itself with the sums paid for the ocean <b>transit</b> of its <b>mails,</b> amounting to something over one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. We also now do the same, with the much greater sum paid by us for such service, which now amounts to 949,228l., or nearly a million sterling. Till lately this was not paid out of the post-office moneys, and the post-office revenue was not debited with the amount.|$|R
