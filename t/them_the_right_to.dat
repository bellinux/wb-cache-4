5|$|In 1962, {{tribal members}} Joseph L. Sanapaw, William J. Grignon, and Francis Basina {{were charged with}} violating state hunting and fishing regulations. All three {{admitted}} to the acts in open court, but claimed that the Wolf River Treaty gave <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> hunt. The state trial court agreed and acquitted the three. The state was given leave to pursue a writ of error and appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to answer whether the Termination Act canceled those rights retained by treaty.|$|E

While they did not recognise the experiments synthesising 287Mc and 288Mc as persuasive {{due to the lack}} of a convincing identification of atomic number via cross-reactions, they recognised the 293Ts experiments as persuasive because its daughter 289Mc had been produced independently and found to exhibit the same properties.|$|E
5|$|The Sueño Libertador is {{a promotional}} phrase used by sports journalism {{in the context}} of winning or {{attempting}} to win the Copa Libertadores.

5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote {{was a violation of}} America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this, {{there had}} been failed {{synthesis}} attempts in 1986–7 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) and in 1990 at the GSI; a 1995 attempt at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory resulted in signs suggesting but not pointing conclusively at {{the discovery of a}} new isotope 267Ds formed in the bombardment of 209Bi with 59Co, and a similarly inconclusive 1994 attempt at the JINR showed signs of 273Ds being produced from 244Pu and 34S. Each team proposed its own name for element 110: the American team proposed hahnium after Otto Hahn in an attempt to resolve the situation on element 105 (which they had long been suggesting this name for), the Soviet team proposed becquerelium after Henri Becquerel, and the German team proposed darmstadtium after Darmstadt, the location of their institute. The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) recognised the GSI team as discoverers in their 2001 report, giving <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> suggest a name for the element.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} Thistles won the Stirling Cup as champions of western Canada, which allowed <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{challenge for the}} Cup again. However there was an early spring that year, and with natural ice used at the time, the series {{had to wait until}} the following winter. In the 1907 season, he led the league in both goals and points, with eighteen. In the Thistles' successful Stanley Cup challenge against the Montreal Wanderers in January 1907, he scored all four goals in the Thistles' 4–2 victory and three in the second game, a 6–5 victory. The team would lose the Cup in a challenge series to the Wanderers two months later. In the two series, Phillips' nine goals, nine points and sixteen penalty minutes were all leaders in those categories.|$|E
5|$|Following the All Blacks' semi-final {{loss in the}} 1999 Rugby World Cup, Wayne Smith succeeded John Hart as All Blacks coach. Crusaders manager Robbie Deans {{replaced}} Smith as Crusaders coach. In Deans' {{first year}} in charge, the Crusaders won their third title in a row − a feat that has not since been repeated. The Crusaders {{finished second in the}} round-robin, earning <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> host a semi-final in which they faced the Highlanders at Jade Stadium. Two tries in the final 20 minutes by Marika Vunibaka helped the Crusaders to a 37–15 win. The 2000 Super 12 Final was played against the Brumbies in Canberra, Australia, where the weather for the final was icy, with sleet and snow. The game was low-scoring, with only one try each. Four penalties by Mehrtens gave the Crusaders a 12–6 half time lead. Following a Brumbies penalty four minutes from time, the Brumbies led 19–17. However, the Crusaders were awarded a penalty from the resulting kick-off, and after Mehrtens converted the penalty, the Crusaders {{went on to win the}} game 20–19.|$|E
5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi {{as he prepared to}} return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E

500|$|Although Jerry Lucas {{was playing}} at Ohio State University, outside the {{territory}} of the Cincinnati Royals, the Royals were the only NBA team in Ohio, so <b>the</b> NBA granted <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> pick Lucas as their territorial pick.

5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
