40|$|In recent studies, contextual {{situations}} of applied colours are compared to colours presented as samples or chips. Findings of such studies point out different results {{in terms of}} similarities or differences between <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> isolated abstract colours and contextualized situations. Architectural and spatial contexts have their own characteristics regarding colouring criteria, so it is of great importance to examine the architectural spatial colouring process {{from this point of}} view. This study explores this process by investigating the consistency of semantic ratings of four sequential stages of the architectural colour design process, namely, colour chips samples, abstract compositions, perspective drawings and 3 D models. The architectural context for the study was a simple interior space. Fifteen different colour schemes were applied on the four media representing the stages. Subjects rated the 15 sets against seven bipolar, five-step semantic differential scales. The scales consisted of harmonious-discord, pleasant-unpleasant, comfortableuncomfortable, spacious-confined, static-dynamic, exciting-calming and extroverted-introverted. Findings indicated that there are significant associations between <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract compositions, the perspective drawings and the 3 D models; however, <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> colour chips are significantly different than the others. The medium effect observed mostly between abstract and contextualized media. Additionally, factor analysis showed that pleasantness, harmony, spaciousness and comfort are connected in <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> contextual situations, while pleasantness and harmony differ from spaciousness and comfort in <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> colour chips and abstract compositions. The factor of activity (arousal) (dynamism, excitement, and extroversion) stays the same for all four media. It is also found that different colour characteristics are determinative over different media. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
