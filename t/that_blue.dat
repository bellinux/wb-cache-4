5|$|During {{their early}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{had played in}} {{whatever}} coloured kit was available locally.

5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{version of}} Half-Life was cancelled, Blue Shift persevered. Prior to the {{cancellation}} of the Dreamcast version, Sierra announced on March 29, 2001, <b>that</b> <b>Blue</b> Shift would be released for PC as well. The game would be released as a standalone expansion pack, a product that {{does not require the}} original Half-Life to run. The new models developed for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life would also be included in the PC version as the Half-Life High Definition pack. In addition, Gearbox announced that the High Definition pack would not be exclusive for Blue Shift, but could be applied to both Half-Life and Opposing Force as well. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2001, Gearbox announced that development of Blue Shift had been completed, and exhibited a playable version of the end product. The game was released on June 12, 2001.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because <b>that</b> <b>blue</b> line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service.

25|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the existence of blue stragglers. The simplest is <b>that</b> <b>blue</b> stragglers formed later {{than the rest of}} the stars in the cluster, but evidence for this is limited. Another simple proposal is <b>that</b> <b>blue</b> stragglers are either field stars which are not actually members of the clusters to which they seem to belong, or are field stars which were captured by the cluster. This too seems unlikely, as blue stragglers often reside at the very center of the clusters to which they belong. Another theory is <b>that</b> <b>blue</b> stragglers are the result of stars that come too close to another star or similar mass object and collide.|$|E

40|$|The individual's proper {{experience}} of blues music and other 'African American' music {{according to his}} or her race {{has been the subject of}} a controversial 20 th century debate. The black arts movement of the 1960 s gave impetus to the popular black nationalistic notion <b>that</b> <b>blues</b> music belongs exclusively to African Americans. Subsequent anti-essentialist and pluralistic theories have problematized the black essentialist notion of racial ownership of music. The work presented below, an ethnographic study of Warmdaddy's in Philadelphia examines two evenings of <b>blues</b> culture at <b>that</b> <b>blues</b> club.
