5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> earthwork castles {{were by no means}} useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its natural}} resources, Sarawak specialises in {{the export of}} oil and gas, <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> oil palms, but also {{possesses}} strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Iban, Malay, Chinese, Melanau, Bidayuh and Orang Ulu. English and Malay are the two official languages of the state; there is no official religion.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle-Atlantic states, {{it caused}} little injury overall, though many boats and ships were capsized. To {{the north in}} New England, many churches endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due to intense gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, <b>timber,</b> <b>and</b> livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, <b>timber,</b> <b>and</b> livestock. Farther north, entire swaths of forest were leveled, and heavy snow blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to have collapsed. Overall, approximately $100,000 in damage and more than 16deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and {{although}} he enjoyed the view, he conceded that it was best appreciated from below. Muir {{was one of many}} who advocated protecting the mountain.

5|$|Plants serve many {{functions}} in culture. The reliable provision of food through agriculture {{is the basis}} of civilization. The study of plant uses by native peoples is ethnobotany, while economic botany focuses on modern cultivated plants. Plants are used in medicine, providing many drugs from the earliest times to the present, and as the feedstock for many industrial products including <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> paper as well as a wide range of chemicals. Plants give millions of people pleasure through gardening.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} is a two-storied, 17th century {{building with}} exposed <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> plasterwork, constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, agriculture, <b>timber,</b> <b>and</b> {{ranching}} were the leading economic engines of Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led to rapid industrialization. Though refineries were initially concentrated around the Beaumont and Houston areas, refining operations gradually grew throughout the state {{by the end of the}} 1920s. By 1940, the value of petroleum and natural gas produced in Texas exceeded the value of all agricultural products in the state. The state's GDP grew from approximately $119 million ($ in today's terms) in 1900 to approximately $29 billion ($ in today's terms), a more than 240-fold increase. The U.S. GDP as a whole grew by less than 24 times during the same period.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the latter}} half of the 18th century, grain, <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> then coal were Plymouth's main imports. During this time the real source of wealth was from the {{neighbouring}} town of Plymouth Dock (renamed in 1824 to Devonport) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard. The Three Towns conurbation of Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston. Foulston was important for both Devonport and Plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings, many now destroyed, including the Athenaeum, the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel, and much of Union Street.|$|E
5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of <b>timber</b> <b>and</b> have not survived. Hundreds of stone {{churches in the}} Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat-ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick quickly became the material of choice. Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E
