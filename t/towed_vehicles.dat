25|$|Oscar Dyson has a traction-type oceanographic winch {{which can}} deploy up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) of 17-mm (0.67-inch) wire rope or other cable, {{including}} fiberoptic cable. She also has two hydrographic winches, {{each of which}} can deploy 3,600 meters (11,811 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) EM cable, two trawl winches, each of which can deploy 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of cable, and a Gilson winch. She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454kg) at her bow. She has an A-frame on her starboard side with a safe working load of 8,050 pounds (3,651kg) and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, <b>towed</b> <b>vehicles,</b> dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays.|$|E

5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> rear axle to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. <b>Tow</b> <b>vehicles</b> often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle's</b> hitch.

Some states (such as North Dakota) provide exemptions for farmers, allowing non-commercial license holders to operate semis within a certain air-mile radius of their reporting location. State exemptions, however, are only applicable in intrastate commerce; stipulations of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be applied in interstate commerce. Also a person under the age of 21 cannot operate a commercial vehicle outside the state where the commercial license was issued. This restriction may also be mirrored by certain states in their intrastate regulations. A person must be at least 18 in order to be issued a commercial license.|$|E
