5000|$|BUR-140 - The “BUR-140” {{is arguably}} the best known BUR product. It {{replaced}} the BUR-130. [...] Unlike previous BUR sets, the BUR-140 came with a 38-inch chrome-plated and knurled revolving barbell sleeve. This sleeve increased the grip diameter of the 5 ft steel bar from 1" [...] to 1-1/8”. The set's dumbbells also included removable revolving sleeves. Finally, the BUR-140 came with BUR’s own oversized inner collars; these collars were machined to allow the bar sleeve to rotate freely while simultaneously eliminating the gaps between sleeve and collars that were common at the time. According <b>to</b> <b>BUR</b> brochures, the new bar could support a maximum weight of 400-pounds. The BUR-140 sold for $16.80 in the early 1950s (about $140 in 2010 adjusted dollars) and was still being produced when the company closed in the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} ethylene combustion in scramjet engine applications has been performed. The capability of simplified chemical reaction mechanisms to accurately calculate ignition delay and heat release has been assessed. The 10 step Jachimowski ethylene combustion model {{was found to}} over predict ignition delay by almost an order of magnitude. Using this mechanism, CFD calculations have been made of a threedimensional geometry representing a potential configuration for the Australian developed HyShot scramjet. The free stream conditions are those of shock tunnel conditions with equivalent flight speed of Mach 9. 4 at 35 km altitude. Within the 3 D flow field the Jachimowski reaction mechanism calculated extremely limited combustion with one percent of injected fuel consumed.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} chlorhexidine-digluconate (CHX) and galardine (G) – common MMP-Inhibitors – on microtensile bond strength (ìTBS). Methods: Ceramic specimens were cemented <b>to</b> <b>bur</b> –cut dentin surfaces with the self-adhesive (SA) materials RelyX Unicem 2 (RLX, 3 M Espe) and Clearfil SA (CSA, Kuraray) or the etch & rinse based Nexus 3 (NX, Kerr). The surfaces were pretreated with either 2 % CHX or 0. 2 mM G, and one-week- ìTBS was determined. Results: 2 way-ANOVA revealed {{a significant difference between the}} resin cements (p< 0. 001), but no effect of pre-treatment (p= 0. 1688). However, the ìTBS of NX was significantly lower compared to NX/CHX (p= 0. 0022), for RLX and RLX/CHX it was contrary (p= 0. 0010, Tukey multiple comparisons). G had no effect on ìTBS.

40|$|Several {{missions}} are planned in Russia to launch spacecraft into {{the vicinity of}} the Solar-Terrestrial collinear libration points. The first of them is Spectr-Roentgen-Gamma intended to explore the sky in X-ray and Gamma-ray band. There are technical constraints on this project’s realization, influencing the scenario of inserting the spacecraft into the operational orbit. One of these constraints is the location of the available ground station. Due to the high latitude of Russian stations it is impossible to have visibility of the spacecraft from them during those phases of flight when the spacecraft is well below the ecliptic plane. To avoid this phenomenon, it is necessary to decrease the orbit amplitude in the direction orthogonal to the ecliptic plane. There are several methods how to do this including one with gravity assist maneuvers near Moon or use of the rocket engine for correction maneuvers, but the simplest – the search of an appropriate option within the family of possible transfer trajectories. In the paper all these approaches are analyzed and it is shown that for standard scenario for them some difficulties do exist leading to the decrease the reliability of mission at large. The reason is that the thrust of the spacecraft rocket engines is too low, leading <b>to</b> <b>bur...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) of a CAD/CAM leucite reinforced glass-ceramic ground by diamond burs of different grit sizes and the influence of surface roughness on the BFS. For this, 104 plates were obtained from CAD/CAM ceramic blocks and divided into 4 groups (n = 26), according <b>to</b> <b>bur</b> grit size: extra-fine, fine, medium and coarse. Roughness parameters (Ra, RyMax) were measured, and plates were kept dry for 7 days. The flexural test was carried out and BFS was calculated. Ra, RyMax and BFS data were subjected to analysis of variance and post-hoc test. Weibull analysis was used to compare characteristic strength and Weibull modulus. Regression analysis was performed for BFS vs. Ra and RyMax. When burs with coarse grit were used, higher surface roughness values were found, causing a negative effect on the ceramic BFS (117 MPa for extra-fine, and 83 MPa for coarse). Correlation (r) between surface roughness and BFS was 0. 78 for RyMax and 0. 73 for Ra. Increases in diamond grit size have a significant negative effect on the BFS of leucite-reinforced glass-ceramics, suggesting that grinding of sintered glass-ceramic should be performed using burs with the finest grit possible in order to minimize internal surface flaws and maximize flexural strength...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the central}} Iranian Esfahan-Sirjan and Qom basins {{sedimentation}} of the Oligo-/Miocene Qom Forma-tion {{took place on}} extensive mixed carbonate–siliciclastic ramps. During this time, both basins were positioned at the Eurasian margin of the Tethyan Seaway, which connected the western and eastern regions of the Tethys Ocean {{at least until the}} late Burdigalian. During the so-called Terminal Tethyan Event the Tethyan Seaway was then closed due to the collision of the African/Arabian and Iranian/Eurasian plates. Facies analysis of the sedimentary record of both basins indicates paleoenvironments ranging from terrestrial to open marine settings, including mangrove, restricted inner shelf lagoon, seagrass meadow, reefal, and deeper offshore environments. Recognition of eight depositional sequences and elaboration of an integrated biostratigraphic framework (calcareous nannoplankton, planktic and larger benthic foraminifers, gastropods, and pectinids) allow us to construct a basin-spanning stratigraphy. The assignment of the recognized sea-level lowstands to the Ru 3 <b>to</b> <b>Bur</b> 3 lowstands of the global sea-level curve enables a compar-ison with time-equivalent sections from the Zagros Basin, which was part of the African/Arabian Plate on the opposing southern margin of the Tethyan Seaway.

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} the effects of cutting dentin withdifferent burs at various speeds on microtensile bond strength(lTBS) of two self-etch adhesive systems. Methods: Flat deep dentin surfaces from ﬁfty extracted humanthird molars were divided into ﬁve groups according <b>to</b> <b>bur</b> typeand speed of rotation (I) high-speed diamond bur, (II) low-speeddiamond bur, (III) high-speed tungsten carbide bur, (IV) low-speed tungsten carbide bur. Controls were abraded with # 600 grit SiC paper. A two-step self-etch adhesive, Clearﬁl SE Bond(SE; Kuraray) and a one-step self-etch adhesive, Clearﬁl S 3 Bond (S 3; Kuraray) were applied to dentin surfaces and light-cured. Composite build-ups were performed using Filtek Z 250 (3 M ESPE). For lTBS evaluation, composite-dentin beams of 0. 8 mm 2 were stressed to failure at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The lTBS data was analyzed using two-wayANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Representativefractured beams from each group were prepared for fracto-graphic analysis under SEM. Results: Two-way ANOVA showed that the effects of dentin surfacepreparation, adhesives systems and their interaction were statisti-cally signiﬁcant (P< 0. 05). The lTBS were signiﬁcantly loweredwhen bonding SE or S 3 to dentin cut with a high-speed diamond bur(P < 0. 05), which produced a thick smear layer and irregularsurface for bonding.
