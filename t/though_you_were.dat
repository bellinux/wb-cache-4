Wired described the iPhone 5 as [...] "elegance rooted {{in the way the}} aluminum and glass work together.

Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn’t really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.|$|E
500|$|As of 2015–16, {{there were}} still a {{significant}} number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" [...] (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> holding a slick $650 bar of soap".

When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh! Look at Me Now", [...] "Dolores", [...] "Everything Happens to Me" [...] and [...] "This Love of Mine" [...] in 1941; [...] "Just as <b>Though</b> <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> There", [...] "Take Me" [...] and [...] "There Are Such Things" [...] in 1942; and [...] "It Started All Over Again", [...] "In the Blue of Evening" [...] and [...] "It's Always You" [...] in 1943. As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E

2500|$|When the Japanese began attacking Canton in {{the late}} 1930s, Dr. Cadbury, as a Quaker (and therefore, a pacifist) at first felt {{conflicted}} about supporting China's fighting in the war. However, he knew this was necessary for China to defend itself against Japan and for preventing as many deaths of innocent people as possible. When discovering that the USA {{was one of the}} largest arms suppliers to Japan, he urged the USA to support the Chinese in [...] "their fight for freedom," [...] and not Japan. One of his associates even said [...] "It seems as <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> just like one of us Chinese." [...] However, after the war, his support for the Nationalists of China wavered. This is because though he worked to rally the support of Americans for the Canton people, the Chinese (Nationalist) government gave very limited help to them.|$|E
