5|$|In February 1936, the Roeriches and <b>their</b> <b>associates</b> had {{attempted}} to obtain an injunction to prevent these actions. When the attempt failed, they sued Horch to regain what they believed to be their rightful authority {{to participate in the}} operation of the building and its component organizations. This case was settled on February 9, 1938, in favor of Horch. George Frankenthaler, the referee who decided the case, found that the Roeriches never possessed the authority they claimed. Horch alone administered the corporation that had the building constructed, ran the organizations that it housed, and obtained all the needed financing. In addition, he donated {{more than a million dollars}} of his own, while the Roeriches and <b>their</b> <b>associates</b> had contributed no money at all. Regarding allegations of deception, he found Horch to be the more creditable witness.|$|E

5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} experts Philip J. Klotzbach, William M.

Klotzbach's team, formerly led by Gray, determined {{the average number}} of storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.|$|E

The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and <b>their</b> <b>associates,</b> rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.|$|E
5|$|In advance of, and during, each {{hurricane}} season, several {{forecasts of}} hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States NOAA's National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and <b>their</b> <b>associates</b> at CSU, Tropical Storm Risk, and the United Kingdom's Met Office. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained roughly 12tropical storms, 6hurricanes, 3major hurricanes, and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index of 66–103units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.|$|E

5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and <b>their</b> <b>associates</b> to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hartwell {{notes that}} in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who {{dominated}} the civil service: a founding elite and a professional elite. The founding elite consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century, <b>their</b> <b>associates,</b> personal staffs, and bureaucrats who {{had served in the}} capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties. The professional bureaucracy consisted of elite families who had established residence in Kaifeng or subordinate capitals, claimed prestigious clan ancestry, had intermarried with other prominent families, had members in higher offices over generations, and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century. The prominent families of this professional elite accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors, the highest official post. From 960 to 986, the founding military elite from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei represented 46% of fiscal offices, people from districts in Songzhou—the military governorship of the founding emperor—represented 22% of fiscal offices, and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13% of fiscal posts. In the same period, the founding elite and professional elite filled over 90% of policy-making positions. However, after 983, when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire, a semi-hereditary professional elite gradually replaced the founding elite. After 1086 not a single family of the founding elite had a member in either policy-making or financial positions. Between 998 and 1085, the 35 most important families of the professional elite represented only 5% of the families that had members in policy-making offices, yet they disproportionately held 23% of these positions. By the late 11th century the professional elite began to break apart as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service. They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages who had their children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers. Hartwell states that this shift of power {{was the result of the}} professional elite's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century.|$|E
