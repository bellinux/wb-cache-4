500|$|Some {{documented}} uses {{of animals}} were not thermal or incendiary. Live insects were also used, to sting the enemy. [...] 4th century BC writer Aeneas Tacticus suggested defenders should let wasps and bees into enemy mines, and jars of scorpions were sometimes fired during early bombardment in naval battles. In 189 BC Ambracia was besieged [...] by the Romans, who dug mines under the walls. [...] The defenders filled a clay jar with chicken feathers, which they then lit, using bellows to blow <b>the</b> <b>acrid</b> smoke down the tunnel; unable {{to approach the}} pot due to defensive spears, the Romans were forced to abandon their works.|$|E
500|$|When opponents {{sought to}} modify the tariff bill to allow for an income tax, Taft opposed {{it on the ground}} that the Supreme Court would likely strike it down as unconstitutional, as it had before. Instead, they {{proposed}} a constitutional amendment, which passed both houses in early July, was sent to the states, and by 1913 was ratified as the Sixteenth Amendment. In the conference committee, Taft won some victories, such as limiting the tax on lumber. The conference report passed both houses, and Taft signed it on August 6, 1909. The Payne-Aldrich tariff was immediately controversial. According to Coletta, [...] "Taft had lost the initiative, and the wounds inflicted in <b>the</b> <b>acrid</b> tariff debate never healed".|$|E

500|$|Lactarius alnicola, {{commonly}} known as the golden milkcap, is a species of fungus in the Russulaceae family. The fruit bodies produced by the fungus are characterized by a sticky, vanilla-colored cap up to [...] wide with a mixture of yellow tones arranged in faint concentric bands. The stem is up to [...] long and has yellow-brown spots. When it is cut or injured, the mushroom oozes a white latex, which has an intensely peppery taste. <b>The</b> <b>acrid</b> taste of the fruit bodies renders them unpalatable. The fungus is found in the western United States and Mexico, where it grows in mycorrhizal associations with various coniferous trees species, such as spruce, pine and fir, and deciduous species such as oak and alder. It has also been collected in India. Two varieties have been named: var. pitkinensis, known from Colorado, and var. pungens, from Michigan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} form of urticating hairs in plants are typified by nettles, which possess sharp-pointed hollow hairs seated on a gland which secretes an acrid fluid. [...] The points of these hairs usually break off in the wound, and <b>the</b> <b>acrid</b> fluid is pressed into it. Various plants {{unrelated}} to true nettles (Urtica species) possess similar defensive hairs, and the common names often reflect this (e.g., [...] "bull nettle").|$|E

5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell.

Though <b>the</b> strong, <b>acrid</b> taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species.
