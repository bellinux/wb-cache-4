5|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} {{warfarin}} {{show that it}} exists in <b>tautomeric</b> form, as the cyclic hemiketal, which is formed from the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3-position substituent. However, the existence of many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.|$|E

25|$|Uracil {{undergoes}} amide-imidic acid <b>tautomeric</b> shifts {{because any}} nuclear instability the molecule may have from {{the lack of}} formal aromaticity is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability.

The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.|$|E
25|$|Guanine, {{along with}} adenine and cytosine, {{is present in}} both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. Guanine has two <b>tautomeric</b> forms, the major keto form (see figures) and rare enol form.|$|E
25|$|Thiourea {{occurs in}} two <b>tautomeric</b> forms, {{of which the}} thione form predominates in aqueous solutions. The {{equilibrium}} constant has been calculated as being Keq = 1.04·10−3. The thiol form, which {{is also known as}} an isothiourea, can be encountered in substituted compounds such as isothiouronium salts.|$|E
25|$|The {{determination}} of {{which of the}} two <b>tautomeric</b> forms is present in solution {{has been the subject of}} many publications. The energy difference appears to be very small and is dependent on the polarity of the solvent. Non-polar solvents favour the formation of 2-hydroxypyridine whereas polar solvents such as alcohols and water favour the formation of 2-pyridone.|$|E
25|$|In {{solution}} the dimeric form is present; {{the ratio}} of dimerisation {{is strongly dependent on}} the polarity of the solvent. Polar and protic solvents interact with the hydrogen bonds and more monomer is formed. Hydrophobic effects in non-polar solvents lead to a predominance of the dimer. The ratio of the <b>tautomeric</b> forms is also dependent on the solvent. All possible tautomers and dimers can be present and form an equilibrium, and the exact measurement of all the equilibrium constants in the system is extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|Acetylacetone is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that exists in}} two <b>tautomeric</b> forms that interconvert rapidly and are treated as a single compound in most applications. Although the compound is formally named as the diketone form, pentane-2,4-dione, the enol form forms a substantial component of the material & Co(acac)3 handout|first=Brian|last= O'Brien|publisher= Gustavus Adolphus College}} and is actually the favored form in many solvents. It is a colourless liquid that is a precursor to acetylacetonate (acac), a common bidentate ligand. It is also a building block for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds.|$|E
25|$|This almost-correct {{molecule}} {{possesses a}} tricyclic guanidine group (rings A, B & C), {{along with a}} uracil ring (D). The zwitterionic nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, {{as the presence of}} charged areas within the molecule creates a dipole effect, suiting the polar solvent. Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small changes in pH suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol <b>tautomeric</b> relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a hydrogen bond between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer would make this the dominant form.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring <b>tautomeric</b> structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E

2500|$|Chemically, {{curcumin}} is a diarylheptanoid, {{belonging to}} the group of curcuminoids, which are natural phenols responsible for turmeric's yellow color. It is a <b>tautomeric</b> compound existing in enolic form in organic solvents, and as a keto form in water. Although thoroughly studied in laboratory and clinical studies, curcumin has no confirmed medical uses, and has proved frustrating to scientists who state that it is unstable, not bioavailable, and unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development.|$|E
2500|$|Imidazole is a planar 5-membered ring. It {{exists in}} two {{equivalent}} <b>tautomeric</b> forms, because the positive charge can be located on {{either of the}} two nitrogen atoms. Imidazole is a highly polar compound, as evidenced by its electric dipole moment of 3.67D. It is highly soluble in water. The compound is classified as aromatic due to the presence of a sextet of π-electrons, consisting of a pair of electrons from the protonated nitrogen atom and one from each of the remaining four atoms of the ring. Some resonance structures of imidazole are shown below: ...|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{while most}} organic acids are {{deprotonated}} by the ionization of a polar hydrogen-oxygen bond, usually accompanied by {{some form of}} resonance stabilization (resulting in a carboxylate ion), uric acid is deprotonated at a nitrogen atom and uses a <b>tautomeric</b> keto/hydroxy group as an electron-withdrawing group to increase the pK1 value. The five-membered ring also possesses a keto group (in the 8 position), flanked by two secondary amino groups (in the 7 and 9 positions), and deprotonation {{of one of these}} at high pH could explain the pK2 and behavior as a diprotic acid. Similar <b>tautomeric</b> rearrangement and pi-resonance stabilization would then give the ion some degree of stability.|$|E
