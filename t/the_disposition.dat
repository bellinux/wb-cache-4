5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit {{demanded that}} both of the {{publishing}} companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams' records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams and her daughter and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E

5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however neither side spotted its adversary. The disappearance {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report), caused the Japanese to strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E

5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} Bruneval radar {{installation}} was also gathered during this period, {{often with the}} help of the French Resistance, without whom detailed knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of the German forces guarding the installation would have been impossible.

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his {{longtime}} caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure {{to resolve the}} problem. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point turns out to be <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E

5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E

The ship was initially used to familiarize the British on her high-pressure boilers until October when she was used as accommodation ship in Southampton. Hans Lody was arrived at Sunderland under tow on 17 July 1949 to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disposition</b> {{adopted in}} the battle was one which recurs in many sea-fights of the Middle Ages where a fleet had to fight on the defensive. Olaf lashed his ships side to side, with his own, the Long Serpent, {{in the middle of}} the line, where her bows {{projected}} beyond the others. The advantages of this arrangement were that it left all hands free to fight, that a barrier could be formed with the oars and yards, and that it limited the enemy's ability to make its superior numbers count. The Long Serpent was the longest ship and so also the tallest—another advantage to the defenders, who could rain down arrows, javelins and other missiles while the enemy would have to shoot upwards. Olaf, in effect, turned his eleven ships into a floating fort.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disposition</b> of Rodrigo's body {{became a}} subject of dispute. A {{possible}} cremation and transport of the ashes to the Córdoba province was denied by judicial authorities in case a future autopsy was needed. The idea of a burial at the Lanús Municipal Cemetery was rejected by his mother due to concerns about vandalism. Instead, she decided to place the body in Las Praderas Cemetery in Monte Grande. Since the investigation into Bueno's death was still open and further tests might be performed, his body {{was placed in a}} container by the Justice Ministry. In 2005, five years after his death, the case was closed and the burial was authorized. The body was placed in a marble mausoleum. His mother, manager and friends attended a memorial service where they placed a trophy over the marble grave, symbolizing the appreciation of his relatives, fans and friends.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E

40|$|This article aims at a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} invalidity of states’ consent and examines {{the manner in which}} they are regulated in the Public International Law and in the domestic law. Thus, according to <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> of <b>the</b> Vienna Convention (1969) on the law of treaties between states, invalidity of states’ consent are: breach of <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> of <b>the</b> domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties; the error; the fraud; the corruption of a state representative; the coercion of a state representative; the coercion against a state. The invalidity of states’ consent are sanctioned both in the matter of the Public International Law as well as in the domestic civil law by nullity, either absolute (such as the coercion exercised on the state representative and the coercion against a state) or relative (such as the breach of <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> of <b>the</b> domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties, the error, the fraud or the corruption of a state representative). In certain cases, <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> of <b>the</b> domestic law are fully mirrored by the regulations of the Vienna Convention, as is the case of the fraud, but there are also cases – the breach of <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> of <b>the</b> domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties – where the Vienna Convention introduces a disposition which flagrantly contradicts the civil theory in the matter, the state being able to invoke itself the defect in its consent. At the same time, in the domestic civil law, the rule according to which no one can invoke his/her own turpitude is widely sanctioned. We conclude by showing that the manner of regulation of nullity taken over from the domestic civil law and transposed in <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> of <b>the</b> Vienna Convention fails to meet the exigencies and rigors of the definition of nullity.
