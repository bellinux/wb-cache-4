5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{courtyard}} {{was originally}} {{decorated with a}} bronze copy of Donatello's David, which was inspired by Michelangelo. Placed in 1509, the statue was given to Robertet by <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> Republic. As early as 1513, it was moved to his Château de Bury.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline.

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> Ambassador, one of {{the guards}} of the conclave, as of 10 August there had been three {{unsuccessful}} ballots, favoring Costa and Carafa, but in no way indicating Borja might be chosen. According to Sigismondo de' Conti, papal secretary and chronicler, the vote was unanimous on the fourth ballot, taken early in the morning on 11 August although Borja had only 15 votes prior to the accessus; other accounts say Borja received all the votes except for his own, which he gave to Carafa.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was first}} {{cared for by}} her {{paternal}} grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of Piero de' Medici). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. <b>The</b> <b>Florentine</b> people called her duchessina ("the little duchess"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.|$|E
5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E

40|$|The {{foreword}} is {{a literary}} comment to Brendan Kennelly's two novels {{contained in the}} volume: The Crooked Cross (1963) and <b>The</b> <b>Florentines</b> (1967). Kennelly draws extensively from classic and Irish epic and Joyce himself enters his work. In The Crooked Cross {{we can hear the}} echo of the classic Odyssey {{on the one hand and}} detect the prevailing mode of the tale of traditional Irish epic on the other. Emigration is an underlying theme in both novels though in <b>The</b> <b>Florentines</b> it is just temporarily experienced by the protagonist while coming of age. <b>The</b> <b>Florentines,</b> which represents an early and very original example of the campus novel tradition, belongs to the bildungsroman genre and its central theme is encounter: with England, English university life, English language...|$|R

5|$|In 1669, {{fears of}} an Ottoman attack rose {{after the fall}} of Candia, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited Antonio Maurizio Valperga, the military engineer of the House of Savoy, to improve Malta's fortifications.

5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E
5|$|In his Cronica, Villani {{writes that}} the Guelph defeat by the Ghibellines at Montaperti in 1260 was a major setback to the {{historical}} progress of the Republic of Florence. In this civil war, the Guelphs were a faction united with the papacy in Rome, while the Ghibellines were allied with the descendants of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and supported by Siena. According to Villani, <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> Guelphs' last stand was in defending the Carroccio, a chariot which symbolized {{the independence of the}} Commune of Florence. Villani estimated that 2,500 Florentine troops were killed and 1,500 captured during the battle, which Roberta J.M. Olson states are conservative numbers in regards to subsequent historians writing of the battle's casualties.|$|E
5|$|Momolo Mortara died in 1871, {{shortly after}} {{spending}} seven {{months in prison}} during his trial {{over the death of}} a servant girl who had fallen from the window of his apartment. He had been found guilty of murdering her by <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.|$|E

5|$|Monteverdi also {{received}} commissions from other Italian states {{and from their}} communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and for <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de' Medici (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda based on an episode from Torquato Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata. In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, {{for a series of}} works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may be based on <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> , as if to mark John XXIII {{in the same manner}} as a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of clocks in {{writings of the}} 11th century implies that they were well known in Europe in that period. In the early 14th-century, <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> poet Dante Alighieri referred to a clock in his Paradiso; the first known literary reference to a clock that struck the hours. Giovanni da Dondi, Professor of Astronomy at Padua, presented the earliest detailed description of clockwork in his 1364 treatise Il Tractatus Astrarii. This has inspired several modern replicas, including some in London's Science Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Other notable examples from this period were built in Milan (1335), Strasbourg (1354), Lund (1380), Rouen (1389), and Prague (1462).|$|E

5|$|The new Italian trend {{combined}} with existing national traditions {{to create a}} particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, {{one of the founders}} of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{returned}} to Florence in 1307 where he married {{and settled down}} {{for a life of}} city politics. He became one of the priors of Florence in 1316 and 1317. At the same time, he participated in the crafty diplomatic tactics that resulted in peace with Pisa and Lucca. As head of the mint beginning in 1316, he collected its earlier records and created a register of all the coins struck in Florence. In 1321, he was again chosen prior, and in 1324 was deputed to inspect the rebuilding of the city walls. He went with <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> army to fight against Castruccio Castracani, lord of Lucca, and was present at Altopascio during Florence's defeat. In his Cronica, he gave a detailed account of why Florence was unable to acquire Lucca after the death of Castruccio Castracani.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of <b>the</b> <b>Florentine</b> Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
