5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
25|$|Christie's {{experiments}} with first-person narration, especially in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, saw her attempt {{to expand the}} formal resources of the detective novel. In And Then There Were None (1939), her most successful novel in which none of her detectives appear, her third-person narrative moves fluidly among the perspectives of all of her characters. This need to see different events from alternative perspectives (especially her suspects') indicates that Christie increasingly favoured third-person narration {{over the course of}} her career. In Sad Cypress, for example, the character of a woman on trial is made <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> a murderer when the narrative is written from her perspective: a significant red herring that is only possible due to the narrative method.|$|E
500|$|Once one has {{identified}} {{the different types}} of moral thinking, {{the next step is to}} identify when one ought <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> an archangel, and when like a prole. Hare identifies three types of situation where critical thinking is necessary. The first is when the intuitive general principles conflict in particular cases. The second is when, [...] "though there is no conflict between principles, there is something highly unusual about the case which prompts the question whether the general principles are really fitted to deal with it." [...] Thirdly, and most importantly, critical thinking is necessary in order to select the intuitive prima facie principles that will be used.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the critics}} of McCarthy's {{approach}} were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like [...] "story understanding" [...] and [...] "object recognition" [...] that required a machine <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like [...] "chair" [...] or [...] "restaurant" [...] {{they had to make}} all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that [...] "using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise." [...] Schank described their [...] "anti-logic" [...] approaches as [...] "scruffy", as opposed to the [...] "neat" [...] paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.|$|E
500|$|The program {{usually has}} 40–50 first-year students, 15 {{advanced}} students, and 15 counselors. Students are admitted by application—which includes {{a set of}} mathematical questions—or by showing [...] "a great eagerness to learn". First-year students meet daily for lectures in elementary number theory and thrice weekly for problem seminars. They are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> scientists and devise their own proofs and conjectures to the problems posed, which occupies most of their free time. Ross designed the daily problem sets, and many questions contain his signature directions: [...] "Prove or disprove and salvage if possible." [...] Successful {{students are asked to}} return as students and counselors in future summers. Returning students revisit the daily lectures and help first-years with their questions. They also can take advanced courses such as combinatorics and graduate seminars. Student problem sets are graded daily by the live-in counselors.|$|E
500|$|Emotional {{repression}} is also {{explored in}} Psycho-Pass. The identification of latent criminals is partially based around {{the avoidance of}} emotions that society judges to be negative, such as sadness or anger. To avoid being identified as a latent criminal, one must not feel these emotions heavily outside, where their Psycho-Pass can be scanned. Kotaku states, [...] "because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job {{is little more than}} to watch the latent criminals they control—because if they did any real detective work, they might start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves." [...] Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theatre create a [...] "nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes".|$|E

Becoming Immortal has made Cahill insane; he believes he is an angel sent by God to free the world from sin. Cahill starts with the last prostitute he met, Tessa's old friend, Elaine Trent (Sandra Nelson). Tessa is angry to learn the fate of her intelligent, beautiful friend, but later realizes that she [...] " [...] like her judge and jury." [...] MacLeod believes {{that the only way}} to stop Cahill is to behead him, despite Tessa's opinion that [...] "Enlightened societies don't kill their insane. They treat them." [...] When Cahill comes to the barge looking for MacLeod and finds Tessa alone, Tessa diverts him by welcoming Cahill as a messenger of God. Later, she tells MacLeod with disgust, [...] "I had to crawl inside his head... I had <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> him... I had to become like him." ...|$|E
500|$|Angel {{has said}} that, [...] "I {{stayed away from}} magicians when I was younger because I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> them and wanted to create my own style." [...] His first {{television}} appearance was in 1994, where he performed {{as a part of}} a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled Secrets. One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director Clive Barker. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film Lord of Illusions. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album World of Illusion: System One. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, [...] "Criss Angel is extraordinary, a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can’t come quickly enough." [...] During that year, he collaborated with musician Klayton to form Angeldust, a show that combined magic with music. They released their first album Musical Conjurings from the World of Conjuring in 1998. Also that year, Angel performed a ten-minute show over the course of the [...] "World of Illusion" [...] conference in Madison Square Garden, performing sixty shows per day. However, by 2000, Klayton's name was removed from Angel's website.|$|E
500|$|Another way the {{developers}} wished {{to enhance the}} player's Batman experience was through the larger game world. Arkham City has a virtual footprint five times larger than that of Arkham Asylum, and the navigational aspects were improved to offer the player [...] "the freedom and exhilaration of gliding down alleyways and soaring above the skyline". Though the concepts were compared to an open world game, Hill notes that such freeform nature would not be appropriate for a Batman game because it would inhibit the atmosphere they wanted to create, and that Arkham City was designed to challenge the player <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> Batman to survive. To counterbalance the larger game world, {{the developers}} also sought to include more challenges and side missions while keeping the player alert as to the primary mission, such that the players constantly are aware of [...] "extreme pressure of the challenges that they face". The Riddler Trophies were designed {{towards the end of}} the game's development and were incorporated into every area of the map without overpopulating it, resulting in 440 trophies. Rocksteady aimed to make the player think creatively when collecting trophies by requiring the use of gadgets to solve puzzles, rather than placing the trophies in obscure areas of the map as mere collection items.|$|E

2500|$|The Harlem Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 {{million to}} play for them, but he declined, and was picked first in the 1969 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks (who were in only their second season of existence). The Bucks won a coin-toss with the Phoenix Suns for first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets. The Nets {{believed}} {{that they had the}} upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept one offer only from each team, the Nets bid too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge. After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying, [...] "A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} a need to {{encourage}} sureties <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more <b>like</b> self-interested, contracting individuals, and to encourage judges, lenders, and debtors <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more <b>like</b> sureties, the implementation of both suggestions in fact extends beyond mere law reform to a change in social attitudes. Of crucial significance is the assumption of both judges and sureties that it is in the public interest that people should be able to use the family home as security for business loans. The research findings suggest that the position of sureties cannot be effectively addressed without challenging this assumption. Ulti-mately, the role of the law in this process, and in regulating or changing private agendas and private inequalities in a fundamental way, is likely to be limite...|$|R
