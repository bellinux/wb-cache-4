5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Anniversary {{was generally}} positive. The updated graphics, sounds, {{and ability to}} <b>toggle</b> between the remastered and original visuals were praised. Complaints included technical glitches, faults with the original game's level design, and the multiplayer mode's implementation.|$|E

50|$|Feature <b>toggles</b> are {{essentially}} variables {{that are used}} inside conditional statements. Therefore, the blocks inside these conditional statements can be <b>toggled</b> 'on or off' depending {{on the value of}} the feature <b>toggles.</b> A block of code which has been <b>toggled</b> 'off' is similar to it being commented out. This allows developers to control the flow of their software and bypass features that are not ready for deployment.|$|R
50|$|Feature groups {{consist of}} feature <b>toggles</b> that work together. This allows the {{developer}} to easily manage {{a set of}} related <b>toggles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Toggles</b> are {{horizontal}} cross {{pieces that}} run between the stiles or studs. The number and placement of <b>toggles</b> {{depends on the}} type of flat. The length of the <b>toggles</b> is the total width of the flat minus the combined width of the stiles (3 ft, for a 4 x 8 ft, soft-cover flat constructed of 2+1/2 in, stiles).|$|R

The final 1bit (repeated Kstate) {{marks the end of}} the sync pattern {{and the beginning of the}} USB frame. For high-bandwidth USB, the packet begins with a 32-bit synchronization sequence.|$|E
5|$|The only {{physical}} {{controls on}} the lens are the AF/MF <b>toggle</b> switch and the two rings, controlling the zoom and focus. The lens does not have image stabilization. This is common for wide-angle photography which can be performed well using hand-held techniques. Over the range of focal lengths, the minimum and maximum aperture vary.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{affect the}} write {{amplification}} of an SSD. The table below lists the primary factors {{and how they}} affect the write amplification. For factors that are variable, the table notes {{if it has a}} direct relationship or an inverse relationship. For example, as the amount of over-provisioning increases, the write amplification decreases (inverse relationship). If the factor is a <b>toggle</b> (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E

50|$|The digital <b>toggling</b> factor (DTF) {{represents}} {{the number of}} transistors that change their state during the stress test, relative to {{the total number of}} gates in the digital portion of the IC. In effect, the DTF is the percentage of transistors <b>toggling</b> in one time unit. The time unit is relative to the <b>toggling</b> frequency, and is usually limited by the HTOL setup to be in the range of 10-20Mhz.|$|R
40|$|Power {{dissipation}} in sequential circuits is due {{to increased}} <b>toggling</b> count of Circuit under Test, which depends upon test vectors applied. If successive test vectors sequences have more <b>toggling</b> nature then it is sure that <b>toggling</b> rate of flip flops is higher. Higher <b>toggling</b> for flip flops results more power dissipation. To overcome this problem, one method is to use GA to have test vectors of high fault coverage in short interval, followed by Hamming distance management on test patterns. This approach is time consuming and needs more efforts. Another method which is purposed in this paper is a PSO based Frame Work to optimize power dissipation. Here target is to set the entire test vector in a frame for time period 'T', so that the frame consists of all those vectors strings which not only provide high fault coverage but also arrange vectors in frame to produce minimum <b>toggling...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{developers}} refreshed Combat Evolveds {{music and}} sound effects {{along with its}} visuals. While players can <b>toggle</b> the original music from Halo: Combat Evolved, the soundtrack was also rerecorded in partnership with Pyramind Studios, using the 75-piece Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and the Chanticleer vocal ensemble. Because there were no MIDI recordings of the original game's music, Paul Lipson, Lennie Moore, Tom Salta, and Brian Trifon transcribed each piece of music.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with <b>toggle</b> switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a <b>toggle</b> rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E

5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} vehicular combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to <b>toggle</b> between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that <b>toggle</b> ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|An {{enhanced}} PC version titled Cave Story+ {{was released}} by Nicalis on the Steam service on 22 November 2011. Cave Story+ features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, {{as well as the}} option to <b>toggle</b> the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. Recently the game got an update that added exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story + on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{innovative}} algorithm, namely block-overlapping parity check (BOPC), {{that can be}} applied to the existing halftone image data hiding algorithms Data Hiding Smart Pair <b>Toggling</b> (DHSPT) to achieve improvement in visual quality. The proposed algorithm utilizes the properties of block-overlapping parity check to reduce the number of pair <b>toggling</b> required in DHSPT. Our experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm reduces the number of pixel pair <b>toggling</b> significantly and has a better performance in terms of Modified Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (MPSNR), especially when the watermark payload is high...|$|R
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to <b>toggle</b> moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
25|$|The Blake crusher was {{patented}} by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858. The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed {{area and a}} variable discharge area. Blake crushers are of two types- single <b>toggle</b> and double <b>toggle</b> jaw crushers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the single}} <b>toggle</b> jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double <b>toggle</b> jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of <b>toggle</b> plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single <b>toggle</b> jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E

40|$|Computability logic (CoL) {{has been}} {{introduced}} by the author as a semantic and mathematical platform. Also, as the author points out, {{it may be an}} ambitious program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of computability. In the reviewer’s opinion, the primary result of this paper is that the <b>toggling</b> operators are built in CoL so that soundness and completeness of the propositional system CL 13 is proven (i. e., derivability in CL 13 is the same as validity). In CoL, the formulas represent computational problems, and their “truth ” is seen as algorithmic solvability, while the computational problems are defined as games played by a machine against its environment, with algorithmic solvability as machinery to win the game. As the author suggests, the <b>toggling</b> operations can be regarded as choices which may be of use for modelling trial-and-error style decision steps. <b>Toggling</b> conjunction and disjunction, <b>toggling</b> universal quantifier and existential quantifier, <b>toggling</b> recurrence and corecurrence, togglingbranching recurrence and corecurrence are defined in addition to the main operations so far studied such as: negation, constant elementary games, parallel operations, choice operations, sequential operations, blind operations and branching operations...|$|R
