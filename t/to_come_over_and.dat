5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often asked him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha {{was too young}} to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of Path of Radiance {{was handled}} by Nintendo of America's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. During the process, the team {{worked closely with}} Intelligent Systems staff members. The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English, which required staff from Japan <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> check their work. When translating the dialogue, the localization team wanted to preserve the story's depth and serious tone, despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression. While they had the option to add extra text boxes, this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players, so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version. The western version's difficulty was also toned down: the Japanese version's Maniac setting was removed, Hard Mode was toned down, and a new Easy was introduced. These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback, and feedback from Japanese players complaining about the game's high difficulty. The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in Animal Crossing, but still enough to take several months to complete. Due to its serious nature, the team needed {{to take a different}} approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles. As far as possible, the team remained faithful to the original script, aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor. While {{most of the time they}} refrained from putting out-of-context remarks in character dialogue, an exception was Anna, a recurring Fire Emblem character who featured in optional tutorial missions. As she existed outside the game to a degree, they had more freedom to have her make pop culture references.|$|E
25|$|A {{man came}} in before I left, who I {{found out later}} was Baby Face Nelson. He {{came in with a}} drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> the three went back into the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|ASHER. You say that, when Germany {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here <b>and</b> crush us, {{when she}} got through with the Allies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good morning, Padre,' the Englishman said cheerily. 'I {{know you}} by {{reputation}} well enough. Meant <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> called before this. I'm Creighton.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It's {{tough for}} all the fighters, {{and for the people}} who worked five days a week <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here <b>and</b> support us. It's disgusting. It's staggering." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} morning, {{the colt}} {{came out of}} the race tired but in good shape. When Baffert brought American Pharoah out of the Belmont Park barn, he invited the assembled media <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> pet the horse. [...] "I wanted to share him with everybody and show everybody how kind and sweet he is," [...] said Baffert, while the group of about 30 people touched and even kissed the horse. The horse then posed quietly with Baffert and Espinoza to tape a segment for The Today Show, standing between the two men who were seated in folding director's chairs.|$|E
500|$|Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig {{contacted}} Ford to {{tell him}} that [...] "smoking gun" [...] evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had {{been a part of the}} Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, [...] "Al Haig asked <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> see me," [...] Ford later said, [...] "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.|$|E
500|$|Homer sees a {{commercial}} for [...] "The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out!", a much-anticipated boxing match in which Drederick Tatum will fight for the World Heavyweight Championship. Homer decides to have a party and invites all of his friends <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> watch the fight. Lisa tries to boycott the party, so this results in Homer making her stay outside on the lawn. Homer’s conscience eventually bothers him, more {{in the form of}} his daughter's distress than a moral objection to stealing cable due to a hallucination that he goes to prison for stealing cable. He finally gives in to Lisa's protests, begrudgingly choosing not to watch the last minutes of the fight, and Marge and Maggie join them as well. Bart refuses to give in, but Homer drags him outside by force. The family sits the fight out and when everyone has left, Homer hesitantly cuts his cable hook-up while ignoring Bart's objection, but he accidentally ends up cutting the power to the whole neighborhood.|$|E

500|$|... "On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Beresford was {{attracted}} {{to the idea of}} making a Hollywood film with a big budget and powerful distribution. Following his success with Breaker Morant, Beresford received about 150 Hollywood scripts as potential projects; although he went weeks before reading many of them, Beresford read Tender Mercies right away. It immediately appealed to him, in part because it dealt with aspects of American rural life he had seldom encountered in film scripts. Several of those involved with Tender Mercies had reservations about an Australian directing a film about a country music star; Beresford also found the decision strange, but kept his thoughts to himself because of his desire to direct the film. He contacted EMI Films and asked for one month to visit Texas and familiarize himself with the state before committing to direct, to which the company agreed. Beresford said of the trip, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> see if this is all true, because if it's not really a true picture of what it's all like, it wouldn't be right to make it." [...] During his visit to Texas, he saw parallels between the state and his homeland: the terrain reminded him of the Australian bush country, and the Texans he met in the isolated areas reminded him of residents of the Outback. He met Foote and discussed the script with him. The screenwriter, who gave Beresford tours of small Texas towns, felt the director's Australian background made him sensitive to the story's rural characters and would help him achieve the sought-for authenticity. Beresford agreed to direct and was hired after receiving final approval from Duvall (the actor had a clause in his contract allowing him such approval, {{the first time he had}} this power on a film).|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eustace? Did {{you ever}} see him? That {{accounts}} for your question. He only left France long enough <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here <b>and</b> make love to her, and he swears he'll never leave it again. If she divorces him, he'll have to have alimony." ...|$|R

2500|$|Katherine Helmond as Mrs. Ida Lowry. According to Helmond, Gilliam {{called her}} and said, [...] "I have a part for you, and I want you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> do it, but you're {{not going to}} look very nice in it." [...] The make-up was applied by Gilliam's wife, Maggie. During production, Helmond spent ten hours a day with a mask glued to her face; her scenes had to be {{postponed}} due to the blisters this caused.|$|E
2500|$|Beausoleil {{was sentenced}} to death, later {{commuted}} to life (See California v. Anderson); Atkins pleaded guilty for her participation in Hinman's death and {{was sentenced to}} life imprisonment. Bruce Davis was charged in the murder after it was learned Beausoleil had called Davis at Spahn Ranch and asked him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> pick up Hinman's Volkswagen van. Separate trials were held for the murders of Gary Hinman and Spahn Ranch worker Donald [...] "Shorty" [...] Shea, for Family members Davis, Charles Manson, and Steve [...] "Clem" [...] Grogan.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2004, Leahy and Vice President Dick Cheney {{participated in}} the U.S. Senate class photo. After the vote, Cheney was only talking to Republicans. When Leahy asked him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> talk to the Democrats, Cheney upbraided Leahy for the Senator's recent excoriations of Halliburton's {{activities}} in Iraq. At {{the end of the}} exchange, Cheney told Leahy, [...] "Go fuck yourself". Leahy joked about the incident in 2007 when he escorted Bernie Sanders, Vermont's newly elected senator, to the well of the Senate where he was sworn in by Cheney: [...] "When it comes to the vice president, it's always better to be sworn in than to be sworn at." ...|$|E

2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and {{on the back of}} it read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{were other}} things for which I wished <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over.</b> I {{had hoped to}} return before this, but matters {{seem to be going}} on but badly, and if the King of France and his army defeat or drive out the bishop, his power will be greater than ever in Flanders, and in that case I shall send for my wife <b>and</b> {{daughter}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> again, <b>and</b> establish myself here finally." ...|$|R
60|$|Rather choky, {{but still}} glowing, Nedda descended to her train. It was not till {{she was walking}} to the Spaniard's Road that a cloud seemed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> her sky, <b>and</b> she reached home dejected.|$|R

5000|$|In {{league with}} other {{contemporary}} British sirens like Amy Winehouse, Adele and Duffy, her main musical influences are Mary J. Blige and Ella Fitzgerald. In an interview, Estelle remarked: [...] "Every three years {{they are talking}} about the 'British (musical) invasion.' It's been ongoing. It's been an invasion for the last 10 years. We are here! We crossed over. I'm like one of the first black British artists <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> here <b>and</b> win a Grammy. We are here!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Devontée {{brought this}} beat {{that he made}} with Powers {{to one of my}} jam sessions. My bass player, Nick, laid a bass line down and then the next day I {{structured}} it and added a chorus and asked Devontée <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>over</b> <b>and</b> added his rap.
