25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents <b>travel</b> <b>sickness.</b> Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E

50|$|A {{specific}} form {{of motion}} sickness, car sickness {{is quite common}} and often evidenced by the inability to read a map or book during <b>travel.</b> Car <b>sickness</b> results from the sensory conflict arising in the brain from differing sensory inputs. Varying theories exist as to cause. One suggests the eyes view motion while riding in the moving vehicle while other body sensors sense stillness, creating conflict between the eyes and inner ear. Another suggests the eyes mostly see {{the interior of the}} car which is motionless while the vestibular system of the inner ear senses motion as the vehicle goes around corners or over hills and even small bumps. Therefore, the effect is worse when looking down but may be lessened by looking outside of the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} number of individuals {{are at risk for}} the development of motion sickness induced nausea and vomiting (N&V) during road, air or sea <b>travel.</b> Motion <b>sickness</b> can be extremely stressful but the neurobiologic mechanisms leading to motion sickness are not clear. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) represents an important neuromodulator of stress and N&V. Inhibitory effects of the ECS on N&V are mediated by endocannabinoid-receptor activation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the activity of the ECS in human volunteers (n = 21) during parabolic flight maneuvers (PFs). During PFs, microgravity conditions (, 10 22 g) are generated for approximately 22 s which results in a profound kinetic stimulus. Blood endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, 2 -AG) were measured from blood samples taken in-flight before start of the parabolic maneuvers, after 10, 20, and 30 parabolas, in-flight after termination of PFs and 24 h later. Volunteers who developed acute motion sickness (n = 7) showed significantly higher stress scores but lower endocannabinoid levels during PFs. After 20 parabolas, blood anandamide levels had dropped significantly in volunteers with motion sickness (from 0. 3960. 40 to 0. 2260. 25 ng/ml) but increased in participants without the condition (from 0. 4360. 23 to 0. 6060. 38 ng/ml) resulting in significantly higher anandamide levels in participants without motion sickness (p = 0. 02). 2 -AG levels in individuals with motion sickness were low and almost unchanged throughout the experiment but showed a robust increase in participants without motion sickness.

40|$|Background: in many environments {{associated}} with motion sickness there are low frequency motions in several axes, including roll. Roll motion {{has often been}} {{assumed to be a}} cause of motion sickness, either alone or in combination with motions in other axes. However, there have been no systematic studies of the effects of roll frequency on sickness. Hypothesis: it was hypothesized that sickness caused by roll oscillation would depend on the frequency of roll. Method: there were 100 male subjects (aged 18 to 26 yr) who participated in a laboratory study. Prior to experiencing motion, all subjects completed a motion sickness history questionnaire giving information on <b>travel</b> and motion <b>sickness</b> experience. The seated subjects were exposed within a closed cabin to 30 min of sinusoidal roll motion at one of five frequencies: 0. 025 Hz, 0. 05 Hz, 0. 10 Hz, 0. 20 Hz, or 0. 40 Hz. At each frequency, the cabin oscillated through ± 8 ° about a center of rotation located on the seat surface. Ratings of motion sickness were obtained at 1 -min intervals. Results: subject illness ratings were positively correlated with their previous motion sickness, although at each frequency the amount of sickness was small. Overall, {{there was no significant difference}} in the sickness ratings produced by the five motions. Conclusions: the frequency dependence of motion sickness produced by roll oscillation differs from that {{associated with}} vertical and horizontal oscillation. Motion sickness associated with pure roll oscillation of a seat will usually be less than the sickness associated with pure translational oscillation of the seat or the sickness associated with combined translation and rotation...|$|R

5000|$|Pio Turroni's {{preferred}} destination {{turned out}} not to be Morocco, but Mexico, however. On 20 November 1941, after several months of waiting at Casablanca, and armed with a false (or [...] "recycled") passport, he embarked for Veracruz on board the [...] "Serpa Pinto" [...] a Portiguese cargo boat converted for passenger use. His fellow passengers included political refugees mainly from Spain, but also Jews and political dissidents from Germany and the countries it had conquered. There were, in addition, 14 Italian antifascists. Most of these Italians were bound not for Mexico but for New York. The boat had been chartered by the Genevsa-based Red Cross, and the fares of the Italians had been paid for by a committee of fellow anti-fascists based in New York, who had also pledged to pay for return trips of the escapees once the war was over. Cabins were expensive and there were only a hundred of them: most of the approximately 1,200 passengers slept in a large improvised dormitory below the ship's bridge. Not all of the passengers were in good health. One of them, Giale Franchini, the son-in-law of the Italian politician Cipriano Facchinetti, suffered with <b>travel</b> <b>sickness</b> and ate only oranges and lemons for the first week of the voyage, which Turroni was able to get hold of for him.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify personal and environmental factors influencing individual susceptibility to motion sickness during road transport. A questionnaire survey of 3256 coach travellers was conducted. Information on passenger characteristics, travel regularity, activity during travel, use of anti-motion sickness drugs and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility were collected over 56 private hire coach journeys. Details of the travel environment (visibility, temperature and seating) were also recorded. The relationship of these variables with passenger illness and more specific symptoms of motion sickness are examined. Overall, 28. 4 % of passengers reported feeling ill, 12. 8 % reported nausea and 1. 7 % reported vomiting during coach travel. <b>Travel</b> <b>sickness</b> decreased with increasing passenger age and greater travel experience. Females {{were more likely to report}} feeling ill during coach travel than males by a ratio of four to three. Poor forward visibility was found to increase sickness. Passenger illness occurrence was approximately three times higher for passengers with no view of the road ahead (mean, 34. 6 %) compared to passengers who could see the road ahead extremely well (mean, 12. 7 %). No relationships were found between the occurrence of <b>travel</b> <b>sickness</b> and temperature or time of travel. Differences in the pattern of sickness responses exhibited by coach travellers suggest: (1) habituation through greater travel regularity may occur independently of reductions in <b>travel</b> <b>sickness</b> that occur with age; (2) females are more affected by poor forward visibility than males; and (3) the incidence of <b>travel</b> <b>sickness</b> could be significantly reduced by improving the external visibility afforded to passengers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Virtual {{environments in}} medical {{education}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular as a learning tool. However, {{there is a large}} amount of evidence linking these systems to adverse effects that mimic motion sickness. It is also proposed that the efficacy of such systems is affected by how well they engage the user, which {{is often referred to as}} presence. Purpose: This primary purpose of this study was to look at the side effects experienced and presence in the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERT) system which has recently been introduced. Method: A pre-VERT questionnaire was given to 84 subjects to ascertain general health of the subjects. The simulator sickness questionnaire was utilised to determine the side effects experienced, whereas the igroup presence questionnaire was used to measure presence. Both questionnaires were given immediately after use of the VERT system. Results: The majority of symptoms were minor; the two most commonly reported symptoms relating to ocular issues. No relationship was seen between simulator sickness and presence although subjects with a higher susceptibility to <b>travel</b> <b>sickness</b> had reported higher levels of disorientation and nausea.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of vehicle motion, {{a view of the}} road ahead and passenger characteristics in the causation of motion sickness in road transport has been investigated using survey data from 3256 coach passengers and measurements of coach motion. Overall, 28 % of passengers said they felt unwell during coach travel. Prior experience of sickness, travel regularity and age were the factors most highly correlated with illness. Increased vehicle motion and poorer forward vision also correlated with illness. Little difference in illness was apparent with {{a good view of the}} road ahead, regardless of motion exposure, although vision alone was not sufficient to eliminate passenger sickness entirely. The results suggest that <b>travel</b> <b>sickness</b> could be significantly reduced by improved forward external vision and that improved forward vision may be particularly beneficial for individuals new to coach travel and for those who travel less often. </p...|$|E
40|$|Six hundred {{headache}} {{patients were}} questioned systematically about factors which precipitated, aggravated or relieved headache, their personal well-being, symptoms of muscular contraction, {{and other features}} thought {{to be associated with}} headache (migraine in the immediate family, ice cream headache, icepick-like pains, symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, <b>travel</b> <b>sickness,</b> and allergies). These items were analysed in relation to the clinical diagnosis (classical migraine, common migraine, tension-vascular, tension or cluster headache), to two sets of migrainous features (symptoms of common migraine and neurological disturbances during headache), as well as the time course of headache (episodic, constant dull with more severe episodes, or constant). Differences between cluster and noncluster headache in age and sex distribution, precipitating and relieving factors, and family history of migraine supported the view that cluster headache is a distinct entity. The results of other analyses emphasized the continuum between migraine, tension-vascular and tension headache. Indications of neurovascular involvement both during and between headache episodes were most apparent toward the migraine end of the headache spectrum, whereas psychological factors and symptoms of muscular contraction were associated more frequently with constant than with episodically-recurring headache...|$|E
40|$|Scopolamine {{hydrobromide}} (hyoscine) is an {{antimuscarinic drug}} which is primarily {{used in the}} prophylaxis and treatment of motion sickness and as a premedication to dry bronchial and salivary secretions. In acute overdosage, the main clinical problem is central nervous system (CNS) depression. In Australia, tablets containing scopolamine hydrobromide 0. 3 mg are available over the counter in packs of ten. The recommended dose for adults is one to two tablets as a single dose, repeated four to six hours later, if required. The maximum dose stated on the pack is four tablets over a 24 -hour period with a caution regarding drowsiness and blurred vision.
