The Space and Missile Test Center (SAMTEC) has {{conducted}} tests to correlate independent data stream to within ± 10 microseconds. System timing error measurements {{have been made}} to determine RF system delays; the delays associated with wideband analog tape recorders in the recording, dubbing and reproducing processes; and uncertainties associated with processed data. Comparison of the time delays between predetection PCM data and post-detection PCM data are made. Several methods of recording IRIG <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>formats</b> A and B are evaluated for best resolution. Timing error versus tape recorder head azimuth is plotted. Tape recorder phase delay effects on <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>formats</b> and on PCM data are given. The time bias between the time tag and the computer processed data is presented. Sources of timing errors and the calibration and operating techniques available to minimize these errors are discussed. A special time tag technique (Ref 1) has been used in the past to determine the cumulative timing bias for all sources. This investigation {{is believed to be the}} first attempt to identify the individual contributions to the cumulative bias...|$|R

5000|$|WWVB is a {{time signal}} radio station near Fort Collins, Colorado and is {{operated}} by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Most radio-controlled clocks in North America use WWVB's transmissions to set the correct time. The 70 kW ERP signal transmitted from WWVB is a continuous 60 kHz carrier wave, the frequency of which is derived from a set of atomic clocks located at the transmitter site, yielding a frequency uncertainty of less than 1 part in 10. A one-bit-per-second time code, {{which is based on}} the IRIG [...] "H" [...] <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>format</b> and derived from the same set of atomic clocks, is then modulated onto the carrier wave using pulse width modulation and amplitude-shift keying. A single complete frame of time code begins at the start of each minute, lasts one minute, and conveys the year, day of year, hour, minute, and other information as of the beginning of the minute.WWVB is co-located with WWV, a time signal station that broadcasts in both voice and time code on multiple short wave frequencies.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} formats on {{the accuracy of}} dating news {{and the distribution of}} personal events was examined in four conditions.

In the other conditions, they were asked to choose between the two formats. We found a small backward telescoping effect for recent news events and a large forward telescoping effect for remote events.

However I can find no mention of these in the official minutes of that meeting (01 - 195). Since the minutes do spell out much more trivial changes, I hesitate to include these changes without approval. Revision 0 of this document is the affected portions of SRP with change bars from SRP revision 07. Revision 1 of this document incorporates changes from the July 19 - 20 SRP working group, including the changes described by 01 - 227 r 1 (SRP Buffer Descriptor Formats).

5000|$|Although {{the content}} can be read, the often very {{extensive}} <b>formatting</b> <b>code</b> {{makes it hard}} to read. The files produced by most programs, such as Microsoft Word, contain large amounts of <b>formatting</b> <b>code.</b> Such files are easily ten or more times larger than the corresponding plain text. They are not legible. [...] Also, non-ASCII characters must be escaped in standard-compliant RTF. Thus, even with concise formatting, text that uses certain dashes and quotation marks is less legible. Latin languages that make heavy use of characters with diacritics, such as \'f1 for ñ and \'e9 for é are particularly difficult to read in RTF. Non-Latin scripts, consisting of characters such as \u21563 for 吻, areillegible in RTF.
