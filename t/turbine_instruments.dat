Pile jacking has environmental benefits over the traditional method of pile driving which can cause noise and vibration damage to the marine mammals.

They give us a measurement {{about the difference between}} the tested and the healthy structure. The experiments are taken from an active piezoelectric system which is excited with lamb waves in different phases and the fact that any defect in the structure changes its vibrational response is exploited. For localization, five different methods of contribution analysis are used (complete decomposition contribution, partial decomposition contribution, angle based contribution, reconstruction based contribution and diagonal contribution). With these methods, the contribution of each sensor to each index is analyzed, in this way, sensor with largest contribution suggests the path where the damage could be located (from the actuator to this sensor).

40|$|Trailing edge aps located {{outboard}} on {{wind turbine}} blades have recently shown considerable potential in the alleviation of turbine lifetime dynamic loads. The concept of the free-oating ap is speci_cally interesting for wind turbines, on account of its modularity and enhanced control authority. Such a ap is free to rotate about its axis; camberline control of the free-oating ap allows for aeroelastic control of blade loads. This paper describes {{the design of a}} scaled wind <b>turbine</b> blade <b>instrumented</b> with free-oating aps, intended for use in wind tunnel experiments. The nature of the ap introduces a coupled form of utter due to the aeroelastic coupling of ap rigid-body and blade out-of-plane modes; for maximal control authority it is desired to operate close to the utter limit. Analytical and numerical methods are used to perform a utter analysis of the turbine blade. It is shown that the potential ow aeroelastic model can be recast as a continuous-time Linear-Parameter-Varying (LPV) state space model of a low order, for which formal controller design methodologies are readily available.

40|$|Very large wind farms, {{approximating}} the “infinite” asymptotic limit, {{are often}} studied with LES using periodic boundary conditions. In {{order to create}} an experimental realization of such large wind turbine arrays in a wind tunnel experiment including over 100 turbines, a very small-scale turbine model based on a 3 cm diameter porous disk is designed. The porous disc matches a realistic thrust coefficient between 0. 75 - 0. 85, and the far wake flow characteristics of an operating wind <b>turbine.</b> <b>Instrumented</b> with a strain gage configuration and by making use of {{a model for the}} structural response, the porous disc model can be used to measure the thrust force, mean incoming velocity and representative power output. The frequency response of these measurements goes up to the natural frequency of the model and allows studying the spectra of the measured signals over a broad frequency range. This is shown by reproducing the - 5 / 3 spectrum from the incoming flow. LES studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between the power outputs of stream wise aligned turbines in large wind farms [2 - 3]. It is also found that the spectrum of the total power output follows a - 5 / 3 power law [1, 3]. However, based on a detailed analysis and comparisons with field data, the origins for this - 5 / 3 power law and their connection with the wind farm layout and atmospheric boundary layer characteristics are not entirely obvious and still form an open question [1, 3]. In addition to optimizing the wind farm layout for a maximum power output, we are also interested in unsteady loading of the wind turbines. For this purpose it is important to better understand the spatio-temporal correlations within the wind farm. In a first measurement campaign we make use of the high frequency measurement capabilities of the designed porous disc model to study the influence of row alignment on the power output variability and spatio – temporal correlations [4] for the power output and turbine loading.

40|$|Wind turbine load {{alleviation}} {{has traditionally been}} addressed in the literature using either full-span pitch control, which has limited bandwidth, or trailing-edge flap control, which typically shows low control authority due to actuation constraints. This paper combines both methods and demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of such a combined control strategy on a scaled prototype {{in a series of}} wind tunnel tests. The pitchable blades of the test <b>turbine</b> are <b>instrumented</b> with free-floating flaps close to the tip, designed such that they aerodynamically magnify the low stroke of high-bandwidth actuators. The additional degree of freedom leads to aeroelastic coupling with the blade flexible modes. The inertia of the flaps was tuned such that instability occurs just beyond the operational envelope of the wind turbine; the system can however be stabilised using collocated closed-loop control. A feedforward controller is shown to be capable of significant reduction of the deterministic loads of the turbine. Iterative feedforward tuning, in combination with a stabilising feedback controller, is used to optimise the controller online in an automated manner, to maximise load reduction. Since the system is non-linear, the controller gains vary with wind speed; this paper also shows that iterative feedforward tuning is capable of generating the optimal gain schedule online.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend in the {{replacement}} of the babbit facing in thrust pad bearings with a composite polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface layer. The PTFE-faced bearings have been shown to allow a greater specific pressure, reduce thermal crowning, and, in some cases, negate the need for an oil-lift (jacking) system. These designs of bearing require new methods for the measurement of oil film thickness both to assist in their development and for plant condition monitoring. In this work, an ultrasonic method of oil film measurement is evaluated for this purpose. An ultrasonic transducer is mounted on the back face of the thrust pad. Pulses are generated and transmitted through the pad material, bonding interlayer, and PTFE surface layer. The proportion of the wave that reflects back from the oil film layer is determined. This is then related to the oil film thickness using a series of calibration experiments and a spring stiffness model. In practice, the reflected signal is difficult to distinguish, in the time domain, from other internal reflections from the pad. Signals are compared with reflections when no oil film is present and processing is carried out in the frequency domain.

According to the several algorithms reported in literature, a different degree of accuracy is obtained according to complexity requirements. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm approach as alternative to combine some of the reported methods by employing an ensemble architecture. Thus, this damage assessment algorithm integrates advantage of individual techniques in order to increase the performance of the whole expert system. The proposed architecture employs a network of piezoelectric devices to produce guided waves along the structure. The traveling of guided waves is affected by damage producing scattering, reflection and mode conversion, which can be characterized with statistical processing and pattern recognition methods.

This second model of the ALF 502 R- 5 A serial number LF 11 is a highly instrumented version of the previous engine. The PSL facility provides a continuous cloud of ice crystals with controlled characteristics of size and concentration, which are ingested by the engine during operation at simulated altitudes. Several of the previous operating points tested in the LF 01 engine were duplicated to confirm repeatability in LF 11. The instrumentation included video cameras to visually illustrate the accretion of ice in the low pressure compressor (LPC) exit guide vane region in order to confirm the ice accretion, which was suspected during the testing of the LF 01. Traditional instrumentation included static pressure taps in the low pressure compressor inner and outer flow path walls, as well as total pressure and temperature rakes in the low pressure compressor region.

Efforts have been made to keep constant maintenance on the experimental rig. This now functional rig was used to generate experimental results, which were used to validate numerical models created using the commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package of FLUENT. The facility at UKZN is a continuously running cascade system, which consists of a plenum run under vacuum pressure and houses a four-blade cascade. One of these SMR- 95 <b>turbine</b> blades is <b>instrumented</b> with thin-film gauges, which allow heat transfer measurement via a heat transfer analogy through electrical circuit boards. This blade is interchangeable with an instrumented blade with pressure tappings along its span for pressure distribution tests. This facility was used to validate flow measurements, and results compared to previous test data conducted on the rig, using two pressure transducers, a scanivalve and a data acquisition system with LabView software. The method of generating heat transfer measurement results involved pre-chilling the test blade in a cooling box, before rapidly plunging it directly into a hot-air stream. Re-instrumented and more sensitive thin-film gauges would react resistively according to the temperature change. The heat transfer coefficient distribution was calculated using LabView. The turbulence intensity at the inlet of the cascade was varied using a grid of rods of varying diameter. For 15 % turbulence intensity, there was a 16 % overall increase in heat transfer on the pressure side, and 25 % increase on the suction side. For 25. 5 % turbulence intensity, there was an overall increase of 23 % on the pressure side and 40 % on the suction side. The results compared favourably to that of previous results generated by Stieger (1998). The experimental results were used to validate and compare to the CFD model developed in FLUENT. Improvements were made with the meshes developed previously, and results obtained showed that the general trend of distribution was similar, although certain models varied in the correct prediction of magnitude. This research includes a comprehensive study of various methods of numerical heat transfer measurement techniques, which would be used to replace the current ageing electrical heat transfer analogue method used at UKZN...|$|R
40|$| parabolized k-epsilon {{turbulence}} {{model for}} the far wake with results from a physical free vortex wake method for the near wake. The measurements on wind farm aerodynamics used in this thesis mainly come from the ECN Wind Turbine Test Site Wieringermeer, EWTW. This research farm consists of five wind turbines in a line set up with a rated power of 2. 5 MW and a rotor diameter and hub height of 80 meter. The <b>turbines</b> are extensively <b>instrumented,</b> where a meteorological mast is available to measure the free stream or the wake conditions. A major advantage of these measurements lies in the research environment by which data have been recorded over a very long period of high quality. The EWTW measurements revealed various new wake aerodynamic phenomena and they offered validation material for the improvement and validation of the Farmflow code. The observations on the EWTW farm are compared with those on large off-shore wind farms, the measurements of which were supplied within the EU project Upwind. In the EWTW line set-up the largest power loss due to wake effects (and hence the lowest overall power) appears at the second turbine in the farm. The turbines deeper in the farm have a slightly higher power. This is opposite {{to the situation in}} large off-shore wind farms where the power keeps decreasing for turbines deeper into the farm. This can be explained by lateral wake effects and the size of those large (array) wind farms. The power behavior in both the EWTW {{as well as in the}} large array wind farms was predicted well with Farmflow. Several conclusions on wind farm aerodynamics are drawn. The most important conclusion is that as for the situation on rotor aerodynamics, much progress has been achieved over the past decades. This is illustrated with the developments from Wakefarm to Farmflow. In the beginning of the 1990 's only single wakes were considered. These were modelled with a very simple approach: The wind turbine was represented by an actuator disc with a near wake model based on momentum theory (and later empiricism). The far wake was modelled with a turbulence model tuned for non wind energy applications. Since then the near wake models has been refined and multiple wake effects are taken into account in both axial and lateral direction. Furthermore the turbulence model has been calibrated for wind turbine wake situations. For the development of wind farm engineering models in general it is very important that some CFD models entered the (research) scene in which the rotor is modelled with more advanced methods than the actuator disc approach (e. g. with actuator lines). Such advanced models can now be used for calibration of more simple models. Several subjects for wind farm aerodynamics have been identified which still need more attention. As such it is recommended to intensify research on these fields. This holds amongst other things for the validation and improvement of multiple wake models and near wake models in multiple wake situations. Also the interaction of wind farms with the outer atmosphere deserves more attention. Moreover there is a need to refine the turbulence models for wind farm aerodynamics. Another main question to be answered is the importance of rotor aerodynamics for wake aerodynamics. More specifically it should be determined whether it is justified to model the rotor as an actuator disc. The answer to this question can be found by comparing results from CFD codes, which models both the rotor and the wake in a detailed way, with results from a similar code in which the rotor is replaced by an actuator disc. As for the situation on rotor aerodynamics it is again concluded that progress on the field of wind farm aerodynamics is hampered by a shortage of high quality validation material. For this reason it is recommended to intensify the measurement activities for wind farm aerodynamics. In this thesis minimum requirements for such measurement programs are given. Measurements anyhow need to be done on full scale wind farms, preferably in combination with wind tunnel measurements. The first type of measurements yield representative information but generally lack a sufficient degree of detail for a complete interpretation of the wind farm aerodynamic problem. Furthermore field measurements are difficult to interpret due to the stochastic turbulent environment in the free atmosphere. The second type of measurements can yield very detailed and easy interpretable information but the scale of the model turbines is far too small. An interesting intermediate is then the so-called ECN scaled wind farm. This farm consists of 10 wind turbines with a rotor diameter of 7. 6 m and a rated power of 10 kW. The farm is heavily instrumented where the size is sufficiently large to make the results at least to some extent, representative for full scale situations. The combination of full scale measurements, scaled farm measurements and wind tunnel measurements then forms the most complete experimental base for wind farm aerodynamics even though each type of measurements has its own drawbacks.
