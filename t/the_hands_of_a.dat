Shortly after the trial of the Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank weapon in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E

5|$|In Parata Venpa, Aravan asks Krishna {{to grant}} him the boon of a heroic {{death on the}} {{battlefield}} at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great hero. Although Parata Venpa mentions only one boon, the overall Tamil tradition preserves {{a total of three}} distinct boons associated with Aravan. The single boon of Parata Venpa, according to Hiltebeitel, indicates an early (9th-century) effort to harmonize the Tamil tradition of Aravan's pre-battle sacrifice with the original Sanskrit account of his death during the battle at the hands of Alambusha (Alampucan in Tamil).|$|E
5|$|Led by Enver Pasha, a coup in Turkey in 1913 sidelined Sultan Mehmed V and {{concentrated}} power in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> junta. Despite the secular {{nature of the}} new government, Turkey retained its traditional influence over the Muslim world. Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled the Muslim holy city of Mecca throughout the war. The Sultan's title of Caliph was recognised as legitimate by most Muslims, including those in Afghanistan and India.|$|E

5|$|Obrenović {{feared that}} Karađorđe's return would prompt the Ottomans to renege on the {{agreement}} {{reached by the}} Porte and Obrenović's followers in November 1815. By extension, Karađorđe's murder precluded the Serbs of the Pashalik from {{taking part in the}} Balkan-wide rebellion that the Filiki Eteria had been planning. In Constantinople, Karađorđe's head was impaled on a stake and left on public display for a week. His body was buried on Serbian soil, but his skull ended up in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Constantinople museum. It was stolen some years later and buried in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{lost control}} of his men, and British {{soldiers}} began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.|$|E

Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.|$|E

Many wound up in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|As {{the civil}} disobedience {{campaign}} {{spread to other}} parts of the north-east, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike accused ITAK of trying to establish a separate state. In April 1961 the satyagrahas were removed by the army using brutal force. A state of emergency was declared on 18 April 1961. ITAK was banned, and its MPs and other leading members arrested and imprisoned at Panagoda Cantonment. Chelvanayakam was allowed to leave the camp and return home due to his deteriorating health. Chelvanayakam suffered from Parkinson's disease and his hearing had been gradually failing. After initially refusing, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike allowed Chelvanayakam to travel to the UK to undergo surgery in Edinburgh at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neurosurgeon Francis John Gillingham. The operation was successful and after a few months recuperating in London Chelvanayakam returned to Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from {{effective}} Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming {{various degrees of}} autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled {{the north of the}} country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen {{under the control of the}} Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia.|$|E
