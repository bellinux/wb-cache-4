Reduces frictional "bump" torque encountered when bearing ball runs into buildup of grease on bearing race. Also used as cable follower to reduce <b>torque</b> caused by <b>cable</b> and hoses when they bend because of motion of bearing. New device includes torquer across ball race. Torquer controlled by servo striving to keep flexure at null, removing torque to outer ring.

40|$|The main {{consideration}} of any reeling {{system is the}} effect it has on cable tensions and hence cable life. This paper explains the relationship of reel <b>torque</b> to <b>cable</b> tensions and the reasons why this relationship is so important. Such system is characterized by variable parameters, primarily a variable moment of inertia and a variable diameter of the coiled cable. For these reasons, {{in order to ensure}} proper dimensioning of the drive, it is necessary to know the motor torques that need to be developed {{as a function of the}} coiled cable. The motor should be able to develop the required torques in a very wide speed range. It is shown that for properly sizing the motor it is necessary take into account the dynamics of the cable reel drive. In this paper monospiral motorized cable reel for winding power cable in crane applications with frequency converter fed induction motor is analyzed. Also, the equipment selection procedure for the real crane with concrete data is shown. Experimental results are recorded during the crane commissioning in real condition...|$|R

Then, cable differential joints are employed to the humanoid robot BHLEG for its torque redistribution, 3 -Degree of Freedom (DOF) cable differential joint for hip, one DOF joint for knee, and 2 -DOF cable differential joint for ankle. According to {{the distribution of}} human energy, <b>torque</b> redistribution of <b>cable</b> differential joint can reduce the power consumption of actuator. Simultaneously, the peak torque and size of actuator is reduced. The aim {{of this paper is}} to verify a simplest mechanism for biped walking with lower energy consumption...|$|R

High frequency vibration creates stresses in the cable and consequently in the ice covering that cable, which may result in ice failure and eventually ice shedding. These stresses were estimated in this study. Displacement of the cable during vibration was determined; furthermore, instantaneous wind loads in vertical and transverse directions, additional stresses induced by the motion in the cable and in the atmospheric ice, as well as <b>torque</b> due to <b>cable</b> springback were calculated. In order to simulate the loading conditions of a chunk of atmospheric ice {{in the middle of}} a span, a new model was developed using ABAQUS. Results from this model show in spite of high frequency vibration, the resulting level of stress in atmospheric ice is far less than its failure limit. In other words, the atmospheric ice under the condition assumed in this investigation does not shed due to aeolian vibration...|$|R
40|$|This article numerically {{investigates the}} effects of {{revolute}} joint clearance and structural flexibility on the overall dynamic characteristics of a deployable solar array system. Considering <b>torque</b> spring, close <b>cable</b> loop configuration, and lock mechanism, a typical mechanism composed of a main body with a yoke and two panels {{is used as a}} demonstration case to study {{the effects of}} clearance and flexibility on the dynamic response of the deployable solar array system in the deployment and lock process. The normal contact force model and tangential friction model in clearance joint are established using Lankarani Nikravesh model and modified Coulomb friction model, respectively. The numerical simulation results reveal that the coupling of clearance and flexibility makes different effects on the dynamic characteristics of the deployable space solar arrays for different operation stages. Besides, the clearance and flexibility of a mechanical system play crucial roles in predicting accurately the dynamic response of the system, which is the foundation of mechanism design, precision analysis, and control system design...|$|R
50|$|The ACCAR {{alternative}} to the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, if adopted in 1997, could have eliminated the navigation paradox at all altitudes, and could have saved 342 lives in over 30 midair collisions (up to November 2006) since the Risk Analysis proof that the current regulations multiply midair collision risk {{in direct proportion to}} pilot accuracy in compliance. The Namibian collision in 1997, the Japanese near-miss in 2001, the Ãœberlingen collision in Germany in 2002, and the Amazon collision in 2006, are all examples where human or hardware errors doomed altitude-accurate pilots killed by the navigation paradox designed into the current cruising altitude rules. The current system as described by Paielli noted as examples that nuclear power plants and elevators are designed to be passively safe and fault tolerant. Reactivity control rods fall into the reactor to cause a shutdown on loss of electrical power, and elevator fall-arresting brakes are released by <b>torque</b> from support <b>cable</b> tension. The navigation paradox describes a midair collision safety system that by design cannot tolerate a single failure in human performance or electronic hardware.|$|R
40|$|The Two Axis Pointing System (TAPS) is a 2 axis gimbal system {{designed}} to provide fine pointing of Space Transportation System (STS) borne instruments. It features center-of-mass instrument mounting and will accommodate instruments of up to 1134 kg (2500 pounds) which fit within a 1. 0 by 1. 0 by 4. 2 meter (40 by 40 by 166 inch) envelope. The TAPS system is controlled by a microcomputer based Control Electronics Assembly (CEA), a Power Distribution Unit (PDU), and a Servo Control Unit (SCU). A DRIRU-II inertial reference unit is used to provide incremental angles for attitude propagation. A Ball Brothers STRAP star tracker is used for attitude acquisition and update. The theory of the TAPS attitude determination and error computation for the Broad Band X-ray Telescope (BBXRT) are described. The attitude acquisition is based upon a 2 star geometric solution. The acquisition theory and quaternion algebra are presented. The attitude control combines classical position, integral and derivative (PID) control with techniques to compensate for coulomb friction (bias <b>torque)</b> and the <b>cable</b> harness crossing the gimbals (spring torque). Also presented is a technique for an adaptive bias torque compensation which adjusts to an ever changing frictional torque environment.

40|$|The master {{thesis is}} a further {{investigation}} of the start-up procedure of a permanent magnet synchronous motor operated by variable frequency drive without position feedback via a long cable and transformers; as proposed in the specialization project, fall of 2013. The challenge is how to avoid large saturation in the transformers and motor while achieving the maximum possible starting <b>torque</b> with high <b>cable</b> resistance. In order to model and simulate the electrical system, the simulation software Simulink is used. A theoretical review is conducted {{in order to understand}} how to model system components, and how to start-up a permanent magnet synchronous motor while avoiding saturation in the transformer. Using the attained theoretical background, two permanent magnet synchronous motor Simulink models (with and without damper windings), an accurate pump load Simulink model, and three scalar control schemes which includes transmission system components for their control algorithms have been produced. In addition, a vector control scheme using field oriented control and extended Kalman filter for position estimation has been evaluated. A study case comprising of a permanent magnet synchronous motor operated by a variable frequency drive without position feedback via a long cable and transformers has been defined. The purpose of the study case is to study the defined control schemes, the permanent magnet synchronous motor's start-up procedure, and the electrical system's steady state behaviour. This include investigation of input parameter effects on the start-up procedure. The simulation results using the implemented pump load Simulink model shows that accurate load modelling affects the start-up procedure, as additional torque is required due to more rotational friction components. The simulation results of the study case show that the three proposed scalar control methods all are able to start-up the motor successfully, regardless of the initial rotor position. However, stability is not guaranteed at certain speed ranges due to the rise of small system disturbances. It has been shown that stability all through out the entire applied frequency range can be guaranteed by adding damping to the system. This is can be done by either adding transmission system components, motor damper windings, or a stabilization loop via frequency modulation. has been shown that cable length and applied frequency determines the accuracy of the transmission system voltage drop compensation algorithms of the proposed scalar control schemes. Increase in applied frequency and cable length increases the inaccuracy of the voltage drop compensation algorithms due to the ignored cable capacitance. Assuming that the maximum allowed voltage deviation from the required motor voltage during steady state is 0. 1 pu, the longest cable length that can be used with the proposed scalar control schemes is 40 km. An exception is the open-loop scalar control scheme using constant voltage boosting, which can be used for cable lengths up to 20 km, due to its inaccurate calculation assumptions. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} the breakaway torque and the reference frequency ramp slope used by the controllers directly affect the torque oscillations during start-up. Additional torque oscillations can be experienced if the breakaway torque is too high or if the reference frequency ramp slope is too low due to the lack of torque build up, which consequently makes the start-up time higher. The vector controller gave the best performance during load step tests due to its precise control of the rotor field. However, due to the requirement of rotor position feedback, position estimation is required. The investigated position estimation technique, extended Kalman filter is able to estimated speed and position with very little error. However, the initial rotor position is required by the extended Kalman filter algorithm in order to predict states properly. Simulation results show that the vector control scheme offers the lowest possible start time due to its high performance. However, due to the requirement of initial rotor position of the sensorless vector controller, it can not be used during start-up, due to inaccuracies of predicting rotor position at zero speed. This leaves either the partial and delayed open-loop scalar control scheme or the closed-loop scalar control scheme to be the most viable start-up control schemes; as both control schemes offer comparably low start-up times, start-up currents and voltage boosting; which will consequently affect the dimensioning of the transformer. The vector controller can then be implemented after the start-up procedure using the selected scalar control scheme, in order to obtain the optimal controller performance. </p...|$|R
