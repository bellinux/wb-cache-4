5|$|In July 2005, a Business Times reader {{proposed}} that the authorities should explore the possibility of <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> geothermal heat that lies many miles under Sembawangsimilar to the project in South Australia's Cooper Basinin order to aid Singapore's reliance on oil and gas. The proposal was not acted upon.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began {{treating}} {{tubercular meningitis}} by <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate {{description of the}} chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Burns learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides {{that he must}} have it, even as Smithers voices his disapproval. After failing to convince Principal Skinner to give him the oil, Mr. Burns establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> oil well. The school is told they have no legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E

5|$|Theoretically, any gas giant {{could be}} {{enclosed}} in a solid shell; {{at a certain}} radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy {{could be provided by}} <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> thermal energy of the planet. This concept is explored peripherally in the novel Accelerando (and the short story Curator, which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by Charles Stross, in which Saturn is converted into a human-habitable world.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Messages now {{allows users}} to send {{handwritten}} notes. This is done by turning the device to landscape mode for iPhones (landscape or portrait for iPad users) and then <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> handwriting squiggle. The Messages app automatically saves recently used notes, {{to make it easier}} to send them again. A handwritten message can be deleted in the same way an app is deleted; by holding down on the message and pressing Delete. The message can also be saved as a picture file.|$|E

5|$|On 4 October 1998, Arsenal hosted Newcastle United at Highbury; Dennis Bergkamp scored {{his first}} league {{goal of the}} season in a 3–0 win. The team failed to convert several chances against Southampton, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw; Anelka and Petit did however score against Blackburn Rovers the {{following}} game, thus putting pressure on opposing manager Roy Hodgson as Blackburn remained in the bottom four. The month ended with a 1–0 win away to Coventry City; Anelka scored his fifth league goal of the season, <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> ball in the net after a counterattack started by Overmars.|$|E
5|$|The game {{offers a}} number of {{traditional}} Mario items, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman, along with new power-ups that bestow special suits onto Mario and grant him new abilities. Returning from Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Super Leaf power-up, which gives Mario the Tanooki suit, allowing him to float {{in the air and}} attack with his tail, with a later variant also allowing him to transform into a statue upon performing a ground pound. The player is able to reserve an extra power-up, which can be retrieved by <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> item visible on the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

5000|$|Inserts on analog mixers {{appear in}} various {{locations}} in the signal flow, depending on {{the vision of the}} designer. Most inserts <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> signal after the microphone preamplifier and after the HPF (if present.) Others <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> signal after the channel EQ and before the fader. A few <b>tap</b> <b>the</b> signal after the fader and before the mix buses.

5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> upper part of the chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} sensory fibers have cell {{bodies in the}} mesencephalic nucleus: {{proprioceptor}} fibers from the jaw and mechanoreceptor fibers from the teeth. Some of these incoming fibers go to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (V), bypassing the pathways for conscious perception. The jaw jerk reflex is an example; <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> jaw elicits a reflex closure of the jaw {{in the same way}} that <b>tapping</b> <b>the</b> knee elicits a reflex kick of the lower leg. Other incoming fibers from the teeth and jaws go to the main nucleus of V. This information is projected bilaterally to the thalamus and available for conscious perception.|$|E
