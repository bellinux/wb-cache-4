50|$|It {{has long}} been {{customary}} for many shipping lines to have a common theme for the names of <b>their</b> <b>ships.</b> White Star gave <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> names ending in -ic, such as Titanic.

The Elsinore had cleared from Baltimore for Seattle with the Wests in the high place.

5000|$|In {{the first}} stage, the player pilots <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> through waves of attacking enemies. The player can either fire upon them, or [...] "tac" [...] <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> around them.

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E

5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter.

Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious.
