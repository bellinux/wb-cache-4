40|$|Long-term {{location}} tracking, where trajectory compression {{is commonly}} used, has gained high interest for many applications in <b>transport,</b> <b>ecology,</b> and wearable computing. However, state-of-the-art compression methods involve high space-time complexity or achieve unsatisfactory compression rate, leading to rapid exhaustion of memory, computation, storage and energy resources. We propose a novel online algorithm for error-bounded trajectory compression called the Bounded Quadrant System (BQS), which compresses trajectories with extremely small costs {{in space and}} time using convex-hulls. In this algorithm, we build a virtual coordinate system centered at a start point, and establish a rectangular bounding box as well as two bounding lines in each of its quadrants. In each quadrant, the points to be assessed are bounded by the convex-hull formed by the box and lines. Various compression error-bounds are therefore derived to quickly draw compression decisions without expensive error computations. In addition, we also propose a light version of the BQS version that achieves O(1) complexity in both time and space for processing each point to suit the most constrained computation environments. Furthermore, we briefly demonstrate how this algorithm can be naturally extended to the 3 -D case. Using empirical GPS traces from flying foxes, cars and simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in significantly reducing the time and space complexity of trajectory compression, while greatly improving the compression rates of the state-of-the-art algorithms (up to 47...|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{modifications}} to control erosion, maintain navigation channels, and create harbors are often undertaken near surfing breaks. Surfing conditions {{can be improved}} by these activities, {{but they can also}} adversely affect existing surfing breaks. Jetties are coastal structures that on occasion improve surfing conditions. Even though there is an increasing volume of literature on the ways ordinary waves transform into surfing waves, the mechanics of surfing breaks around jetties has not been explored in detail. Four main types of surfing breaks that are created or enhanced by jetties have been identified. The types are dependent on the length of the jetty relative to surfzone width {{and the degree to which}} the ebb delta influences wave propagation. Case studies clearly show the behaviors of the different types of jetty breaks. Monochromatic wave refraction modeling of each site has identified the surfing break components that produce the surfing waves. Understanding the effects of a coastal structure on sediment <b>transport,</b> <b>ecology,</b> water quality, shoreline position, and recreation is important to minimize and mitigate any potential negative effects and to streamline coastal permitting. The effects on surfing conditions are being considered more often as the social and economic value of surfing to coastal communities is realized. This research helps to better predict the impact of jetty construction or alteration on surfing conditions...|$|E

40|$|Diel {{vertical}} migrations (DVMs) of many plankton species, including single-celled protists, {{are well}} {{documented in the}} field and form a core component of many large-scale numerical models of plankton <b>transport</b> and <b>ecology.</b> However, the sparse quantitative data available describing motility behaviors of individual protists have frequently indicated that motility exhibits only short-term correlation on the order of a few seconds or hundreds of micrometers, resembling diffusive transport at larger scales—a result incompatible with DVM, which requires ballistic (straight-line) motion. We interrogated an extensive set of three-dimensional protistan movement trajectories in an effort to identify spatial and temporal correlation scales. Whereas the horizontal components of movement were diffusive, the vertical component remained highly correlated (i. e., nonrandom) for nearly all species for the duration of observation (up to 120 s and 6. 1 mm) {{and in the absence of}} any environmental cues besides gravity. These persistent motility patterns may have been obscured in some previous studies due to the use of restrictive containers, dimensionally lumped, isotropic analyses, and/or an observation bias, inherent to observing free-swimming organisms with stationary cameras, which we accounted for in this study. Extrapolated over a 12 -h period, conservative estimates of vertical travel ranges for the protists observed here would be 3 – 10 m, while diffusive horizontal motion would result in about 10 cm of travel at most. Hence, these extended observations of phylogenetically diverse swimming protists, coupled with a quantitative analysis that accounts for anisotropy in the data, illustrate the small-scale mechanistic underpinnings of DVM...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBedload {{transport}} is {{the sediment}} load transported {{in contact with}} the bed of a river channel. Empirical relations are often used to predict sediment transport rates. However, these predictions usually lack accuracy. Consequently, a more detailed comprehension of the physical processes is required. For example, we require an improved understanding on how fine sediment inputs to river channels influence sediment <b>transport,</b> channel stability, <b>ecology</b> and stratigraphy. In this context, an experimental investigation was undertaken in a laboratory flume equipped with controlled water and sediment supplies to create bimodal mixtures of coarse and fine spherical glass beads. The flume experiments were recorded using a high frequency camera. We propose a new image analysis chain dedicated to automatically detect the water free surface and the bed elevation for a sequence of images. This method is based on a combination of morphological operations, gradient calculations and watershed transformations. The detections allowed the measurement of important physical quantities such as water depth, slope and their evolution over time. By making comparisons for varying sizes of fine sediment, we have highlighted several phenomena which permit a better understanding of bedload mobility, specifically related to the influence of grain size ratio...|$|R
40|$|Flanders is a {{dispersed}} and diluted metropolitan system. A {{constellation of}} small centres that profit from each other’s nearness. In this studio we explore {{the possibility to}} insert new centralities or to strengthen existing ones in order to value Flanders as a metroplitan system based on small-scale local qualities. With this research by design we anticipate in recent discussions among theorists, urbanists, planners and administrations. All of them try to understand and reflect on the possibilities and characteristics that offer this atypical metropolitan system. At {{the same time they}} try to envisage how this interpretation of Flanders as a dispersed metropolitan system may address aspects like energy, infrastructure, ecology, inclusion [...] . The zone where this atypical metropolis is most evident is the area between Antwerp and Brussels. Our focus is on the Brussels periphery, in particular on the zone between Asse and Leuven, an area that is highly dynamic, offering the possibility to host programs that don’t fit the Brussels region. Within this area we look at Vilvoorde in particular. Vilvoorde is a city that profited from its nearness to Brussels and from its strategic position in the infrastructural network, being close to the national airport Zaventem and at the crossing of a canal, a river, an important railway infrastructure, the motorways around Brussels [...] . These turned the small city Vilvoorde into an important industrial environment. However low cost countries now attract these industrial complexes leaving in Vilvoorde an urban environment characterized by voids and brownfields. These massive voids offer, however, the opportunity to answer a demographic and programmatic pressure from Brussels. About 80 000 persons and different large scale programs, both commercial, recreational, agricultural or business will have to be located in and around Brussels in the next decades. The studio challenge is to think how we can spatially organize these claims. Will we introduce new centralities? Can the larger region become one new urban system? What is the implication for the fragile open space structure? What can be the backbones of this new urbanization? What is the role of public <b>transport,</b> of <b>ecology,</b> agriculture etc. ? The urbanism studio proposes the development of an innovative and multiscalar spatial strategy that goes beyond the conventional urban renewal practices concerning voids and consequently investigates the potential system value and constellational capacity of the multitude and variety of the mentioned voids. It anticipates the emerging of a variety of innovative interpretations of new centralities in the form of new types of housing, work, recreation, ecology etc. nrpages: 36 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{utilization of}} commercially important crabs in aquaculture and fisheries requires a sound resource management, and {{this must be}} based on solid knowledge of the basic biology of the Decapoda. Most crab species pass through a complex life cycle including a development through meroplanktonic larval stages. Since the larvae differ in all major morphological, physiological and ecological characteristics from the conspecific juvenile and adult life-history stages, we cannot easily extrapolate our knowledge of basic crab biology. The larval phase is, in general, physiologically much more sensitive, and is therefore considered as a bottleneck which is critical for the survival, growth and reproductive success of a crab population, regardless whether artificially cultivated or fished in the natural habitat. While studies of species-specific traits of commercially exploited crab species always remain an important task, many principal aspects of the larval biology can be extrapolated with satisfactory accuracy from model species, which are not necessarily commercially important. Model species should be easily available, easy to handle, and have high survival in laboratory culture. Moreover, some specific traits may be differentially valuable for various experimental approaches and contexts. A high number of larval stages, for instance, helps to analyze growth patterns in extended series of successive stages, or indicate long-term effects of variation in environmental conditions such as larval nutrition or physical factors. In other model species, few larval stages with long durations are advantageous for high-resolution studies of growth or physiological changes within individual moulting cycles. In biochemical and physiological studies, large larval size and/or high fecundity are further valuable traits. As most commercially important crab species have a coastal or estuarine distribution, interrelationships between ontogenetic changes in larval <b>ecology,</b> <b>transport</b> patterns, and the physiological basis of tolerance of variations in salinity, temperature or food availability should be studied in model species with similar life history strategies. Since those prerequisites do not co-occur in a single species, there is no ideal model for all different questions. Moreover, information transfers from models to species that are utilized in aquaculture or fisheries remain to be checked in selective (i. e. limited) comparative studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of aquatic vegetation on riverbed and embankments influences flow structure and consequently flow resistance, sediment <b>transport,</b> morphology, and <b>ecology.</b> These influences {{would lead to}} a hydraulic diversity, which is a key ingredient of physical habitat in streams. According to this fact, vegetation is commonly incorporated within stream restoration. Although significance of vegetation as an inseparable part of riverine systems is recognized, but yet it is still difficult to predict how the associated influences will respond to the introduction of vegetation and how advantages of vegetation can be optimized to a multitude of different processes. The primary impact of vegetation is slower flow velocity and thus, reduction in conveyance capacity. In addition to affecting the velocity profile over the full depth, vegetation affects turbulence intensity and diffusion. When mean kinetic energy converts to turbulent kinetic energy within the area planted with stems, turbulence intensity will begin to intensify. As a result of velocity and turbulence changes, aquatic vegetation can affect sediment movement and consequently bed form shapes could be stabilized with new patterns. Bed form characteristics (length, shape, structure, dimensions, stability, etc.) also depend on flow structure and can be divided into different categories according to the bed load materials. Locations and extension of vegetation in river channels is a fundamental factor should be considered besides the general impacts of vegetation in rivers. Isolated patches of vegetation are more common in practical applications rather than uniform vegetated channels in which the mean properties of the vegetation canopy are independent of the location. The present study considered the changes in bed forms through semi-circular patches of emergent vegetation, which are located at the banks of the channel. One of the goals is to find out how an island of vegetation modifies the morphology of rivers and mass transport. In particular, this research focuses on the physics of sediment transport and its effect on bed forms, and flow resistance in the {{presence of}} a patch of vegetation, by using experimental data and numerical modeling. Providing a physically based model for estimating the effects of vegetation on flow parameters, turbulence dispersion, and sediment transportation, the results of the present study contribute to extending the knowledge of morphology and mass transport in vegetated streams. ...|$|R
40|$|Seagrasses develop {{extensive}} or patchy underwater meadows {{in coastal}} {{areas around the}} world, forming complex, highly productive ecosystems. Seagrass canopies exert strong effects on water flow inside and around them, thereby affecting flow structure, sediment <b>transport</b> and benthic <b>ecology.</b> The influence of Zostera marina canopies on flow velocity, turbulence, hydraulic roughness and sediment movement was evaluated through laboratory experiments in 2 flumes and using live Z. marina and a mobile sand bed. Profiles of instantaneous velocities were measured and sediment movement was identified upstream, within and downstream of patches of different sizes and shoot density and at different free-stream velocities. Flow structure was characterised by time-averaged velocity, turbulence intensity and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE). When velocity data were available above the canopy, they were fitted to the Law of the Wall and shear velocities and roughness lengths were calculated. When a seagrass canopy was present, three layers were distinguishable in the water column: (1) within canopy represented by low velocities and high turbulence; (2) transition zone around {{the height of the}} canopy, where velocities increased, turbulence decreased and TKE was high; and (3) above canopy where velocities were equal or higher than free-stream velocities and turbulence and TKE were lower than below. Shoot density and patch-width influenced this partitioning of the flow when the canopy was long enough (based on flume experiments, at least more than 1 m-long). The enhanced TKE observed at the canopy/water interface suggests that large-scale turbulence is generated at the canopy surface. These oscillations, likely {{to be related to the}} canopy undulations, are then broken down within the canopy and high-frequency turbulence takes place near the bed. This turbulence ‘cascade’ through the canopy may have an important impact on biogeochemical processes. The velocity above the canopy generally followed a logarithmic profile. Roughness lengths were higher above the canopy than over bare sand and increased with increasing distance from the leading edge of the canopy; however, they were still small (< 1 cm) compared to other studies in the literature. Within and downstream of the canopy, sediment movement was observed at velocities below the threshold of motion. It was likely caused by the increased turbulence at those positions. This has large implications for sediment transport in coastal zones where seagrass beds develop. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} here {{derive from the}} work conducted for an ongoing two-year research project funded by the French Ministry of Environment and started in 2011. In 2007, 14 % of French municipal waste collected by public services were going through organic valorization, when more than 60 % of municipal residual waste (representing 153 kg of household residual waste per inhabitant and per year) could still undergo an organic treatment. To fulfill European and national commitments though, French biological treatment capacities for municipal solid waste should be doubled by 2015. This can be achieved via home composting, municipal waste organic fraction biological treatment (composting or anaerobic digestion) or mechanical biological treatment (MBT). The deployment of these treatment capacities should however take into account local and territorial specificities {{in order to reach}} a sufficient level of waste management global performance, regarding economic, environmental and societal sustainability French and European commitments. This project aims at performing a comparative assessment of scenarios including different biological treatment processes for municipal solid waste management in France. This assessment is focused on the global performance of the scenarios, in order to understand which organic fraction management mode, under which local or global conditions, can achieve the best performance for society. The objective is therefore to assess scenarios performance regarding environmental, economic, social and societal aspects of waste management sustainability challenges. This analysis is based on a set of waste management scenarios for municipal residual solid waste, including biological treatment for the organic fraction. This set of scenarios also includes a reference scenario representing a usual way of managing municipal solid waste in France without any type of biological treatment. These scenarios are designed according to representative French waste management modes and include: private individual or collective composting, separate collection and biological treatment of organic fraction (composting or anaerobic digestion) and mechanical biological treatment of mixed wastes (MBT). They include a set of parameters used to perform sensitivity analysis in order to estimate the scenarios' global performance dependency on technical and contextual conditions, regarding for example: municipal waste composition, sorting efficiency, biological process performance, opportunities and constraints for process products valorization, treatment installations capacity, public services organization, etc. The comparative assessment of scenarios is conducted via a multicriteria analysis built on a set of specific sustainability and performance indicators for waste management scenarios. These indicators aim at covering subjects such as energy efficiency (treatment processes, <b>transports),</b> health and <b>ecology</b> (natural resources consumption, emissions, effects of organic matter supplies to soils, etc.), economic equilibrium, quality of life, territory development, etc. Expected results of this ongoing project should highlight the fact that the global performance of biological treatment doesn't only rely on technical process performances, but also on the adequacy level between waste composition, territorial organization for municipal solid waste treatment and local specificities regarding societal aspects of households waste production, sorting, collection and treatment. Therefore one of the conclusions should be that waste management scenarios including biological treatment should be designed according to territorial specificities in order to optimize its global performance, and national waste policy should consider global performance targets recommandations instead of process implementation requirements...|$|R
