5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses <b>the</b> <b>marrow,</b> is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just <b>the</b> <b>marrow.</b> Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the hard outer bone and <b>the</b> <b>marrow</b> of their limbs. This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E

(3) Adrenalin or cortisone eosinopenia greatly depends upon its quantitative proportion in the medium. (4) For the direct effect on <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow,</b> ACTH causes <b>the</b> hyperfunction of the eosinophil in a paticular manner but has no influence upon the cell division of the eosinophil.

5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from <b>the</b> <b>marrow</b> cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> bone <b>marrow</b> is <b>the</b> site of {{neutrophil}} production, {{a process}} that is regulated by the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

40|$|Purpose: Adequate {{dosimetry}} {{is mandatory}} for effective and safe peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Besides the kidneys, <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> is usually calculated {{according to the}} MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with the radioactivity in bone marrow aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called "remainder of the body" to <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow.</b> Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate. Radioactivity in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> was calculated. <b>The</b> results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. Results: A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> aspirates and in the blood was found (r= 0. 914, p< 0. 001). No correlation between the calculated absorbed dose in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> and <b>the</b> change in platelets was found. There was a considerable contribution from other organs and {{the remainder of the}} body to <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> absorbed dose. Conclusion: (1) After PRRT with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate, the radioactivity concentration in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> is identical to that in the blood; (2) There is no significant binding of the radiopharmaceutical to bone marrow precursor stem cells; (3) The contribution of the cross dose from source organs and tumours to <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> dose is significant; and (4) There is considerable variation in bone marrow absorbed dose between patients.

Actinomycin C at the concentration of 2 × 10 (- 5) g/dl accelerates the respiration of <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> slightly, but in any other concentration it does not differ from that of the control, suggesting that it does not inhibit the respiration of <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow,</b> 8.

40|$|Today {{anatomical}} {{studies on}} <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow,</b> particularly on features of vascular construction are almost completely known, {{and no one}} can refute that more than a half of <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> is composed of blood vessels, thus naturally the space occupied by the vessels is quite extensive. In view of this, with the use of an isotope I(131) as a tracer, the author has estimated in figures the volume of blood in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> of adult rabbits {{as well as that of}} the spleen whose vascular construction is similar to that of <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> at <b>the</b> same time measured in the same manner the volume of blood in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> and <b>the</b> spleen of various experimental anemic rabbits.

Especially the voluminousness of the blood vessels in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> has been proven in figures from the peculiar vascular construction itself which enables an anatomical estimation. 2) The amounts of blood in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> and spleen decrease accompanying the decrease in the amount of blood in the circulation by bleeding, and following the recovery of the amount of circulating blood the recovery in the spleen is faster than that in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow.</b> This due to the fact that the spleen is more elastic of the two organs. 3) As regards various experimental anemic rabbits, especially in those caused by leucocyte toxins (x-ray irradiation, injection of nitrogen mustard, or administration of benzol), the amount of blood in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> has been found to have decreased in <b>the</b> bone <b>marrow</b> whereas in <b>the</b> spleen it has been found to have increased.
