5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

25|$|At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 5 June <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> {{was one of}} {{thirteen}} fillies to contest the 204th running of the Oaks Stakes (known for sponsorship reasons as the Gold Seal Oaks). Despite her performance in the 1000 Guineas, she was not among the favourites and started at odds of 12/1, probably because, {{as the daughter of}} a sprinter, she was thought unlikely to be effective over one and a half miles. Billy Newnes (who was still an apprentice jockey at the time) restrained <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> {{at the back of the}} field before moving up on the outside in the straight. She took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Slightly Dangerous, with Last Feather third, Awaasif fourth and All Along fifth. Her winning time of 2:34.21 was a record for the race and was faster than that recorded by Golden Fleece when winning the Derby over the same course and distance three days earlier. <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> reappeared in the Nassau Stakes (then a Group Two race) over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in late July.

With Newnes again in the saddle, she overcame trouble in running {{to take the lead}} inside the last 200 metres and won easily by three-quarters of a length from All Along, who was carrying seven pounds less than the winner. On 2 October, <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> started the 3.25/1 favourite in a field of twenty-six runners for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was in contention throughout the race and finished fourth, beaten a length, a neck and a nose by All Along, Sun Princess and Luth Enchantee, with female racehorses filling the first four places.|$|E
25|$|Three {{weeks after}} her disappointing {{run in the}} Eclipse, <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> was one of nine horses to contest the thirty-third running of Britain's most prestigious {{all-aged}} race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over {{one and a half}} mile at Ascot. The 48-year-old veteran Joe Mercer took over from Newnes, who had been seriously injured in a fall on the training gallops nine days earlier. She started third favourite at odds of 5/1 behind the three-year-olds Caerleon and Sun Princess with the other runners including Awaasif, Lemhi Gold, Diamond Shoal and Lancastrian. Mercer held the filly up {{at the back of the}} field and was still five lengths behind the leaders when Diamond Shoal struck for home two furlongs from the finish. <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> made rapid progress on the outside to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three-quarters of a length and a length from Diamond Shoal and Sun Princess.|$|E

50|$|The company’s {{strategy}} is to time-charter its containerships to a geographically diverse, financially strong and loyal group of leading liner companies.

40|$|There {{are many}} major {{shipping}} companies which operate fleets comprised largely of vessels which are <b>time</b> <b>chartered</b> and subsequently sub-chartered on voyage terms. Legal risks will arise {{for the time}} charterer due the differing natures and terms of <b>time</b> and voyage <b>charters.</b> The essential question examined in this thesis is that of whether, and to what extent, legal risk can be minimized by the negotiation of equivalent contractual terms under <b>time</b> and voyage <b>charter</b> parties. The key areas addressed in this thesis are delivery under <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> compared to readiness under voyage charters, off hire under <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> versus suspension of laytime under voyage charters, obligations relating to cleanliness of cargo spaces, rights and responsibilities relative to safe berths and ports, the time charterer's position under bills of lading, and issues relating to redelivery of the vessel and consequent voyage charter liability if the vessel is unable to undertake the final voyage. The methodology applied is {{an examination of the}} case law, with a primary focus on the extensive body of English jurisprudence. This analysis of the case law is accompanied by a consideration of provisions of major charter party forms. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk, to varying degrees, can be minimized through the application and clarification of contractual language. With respect to readiness of the vessel it is considered that risk will be reduced through agreeing contractual language which requires early notification of the vessel's delay. As regards off hire and laytime wording that clarifies non physical deficiencies is proposed. With regard to vessel cargo spaces intermediate cleanliness is identified as the greatest risk. Safe port and berth warranties are determined to represent an area of easily manageable risk, while letters of indemnity relating to bills of lading continue to represent very significant risk with suggested but no certain solution. Finally, with respect to redelivery a final voyage clause for <b>time</b> <b>charters</b> has been proposed which serves to almost eliminate risk in this area. Therefore, it is broadly concluded that risk can be managed but not eliminated through drafting of appropriate contractual terms...|$|R

25|$|In Winter 1943 Gottlieb Duttweiler and the Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund, Zürich, {{withdrew from}} the {{shipping}} company Maritime Suisse S.A. originally planned to establish the Merchant Marine of Switzerland during World War II. Nevertheless, {{the creation of a}} shipping company with initially three Victory and three Liberty ships, sailing on a regular liner service between the USA and the Mediterranean Sea, never was realized. The shipping company Reederei Zürich AG was founded on 26 July 1951, and immediately two fast freighters were ordered from the shipyard H. C. Stülcken, Hamburg: Adele, named after Duttweiler's wife Adele Duttweiler, and Amelia, named after Göner's wife Amelia Göhner. Each unit was valued to 5,0 Mio. DM without the main engines which were ordered separately from Gebrüder Sulzer, Winterthur, for a total price of 3,75 Mio. CHF. The Swiss government financed 75% of the building costs under the terms, that during a crisis situation, the vessels would be immediately put at the government's disposal. Some of the Swiss parliamentarians, but also Swiss news papers were disturbed about the English prefix SUN {{in the name of a}} Swiss ship, and other were indignant with the charterers.

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any charter party is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible {{to pay for all}} port costs and other voyage expenses. [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer. <b>Time</b> <b>charter</b> arrangements specify a daily rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.|$|E
500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the <b>time</b> <b>charter,</b> the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|E

The average one-year <b>time</b> <b>charter</b> rate for a 5-year-old tanker of 280,000 metric tons of deadweight varied from $56,500 per day in December 2005 to $53,000 per day in September 2007 with a high of $64,500 per day in September 2006.|$|E

2500|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> would run at York Racecourse in August, contesting either the Yorkshire Oaks or the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup but was sidelined by a respiratory infection, described as [...] "a dirty nose".

Two weeks later, <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> ran in the Champion Stakes over the same course and distance and started second favourite at odds of 9/2 behind Kalaglow the winner of the Eclipse Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The other runners included the 2000 Guineas winner Zino and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Buzzard's Bay. Newnes settled <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> towards the rear of the field before moving forward along the rails three and a half furlongs from the finish. The filly was initially unable to obtain a clear run and Newnes had to force her through a gap between Montekin and the tiring Kalaglow, appearing to bump the latter. Once in the clear, <b>Time</b> <b>Charter</b> quickly took the lead and accelerated away from the field to win impressively by seven lengths, the biggest margin in the history of the race.
