40|$|In recent decades, forests {{across the}} world have {{undergone}} a significant process of recognition and transference of tenure rights to local communities or individuals, referred to here as forest tenure reforms. Among developing regions, Latin America has seen the most important recognition and transference of these tenure rights to forest dwelling and forest dependent communities. This paper examines the process in Guatemala, where the state has recognised and <b>transferred</b> <b>rights</b> to organised local groups-establishing a community concession system in the multiple use zone of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. We analyse the evolution of claims over forest uses, {{and focus on the}} legitimacy elements underpinning the process of a claim becoming a right. The results indicate that in order to sustain this forest tenure reform process over time, {{it is important to understand}} how tenure arrangements are transferred and distributed among rights-receivers, and how this process is influenced by the elements that underpin legitimation as well as those that define authority. Understanding the underpinnings of the legitimacy behind forest tenure reforms is central to identifying ways in which these processes can work, and also becomes important for developing more sound policy frameworks that fill gaps and resolve incongruence in governmental systems for forest management...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of {{transfer}} of undertaking as recognized by the Acquired Rights Directive 2001 / 23 /EC under the EU and Czech law. The first chapter "general introduction" offers an overview of the basic relationships that arise in the course of employment, and the basics of European law. The second chapter considers the rules of the transfer of undertaking under the Acquired Rights Directive and in light of ECJ case law. It defines the terms legal transfer and merger, economic entity which retains its identity, employee, transferor and transferee. Further, it considers the <b>transferred</b> <b>rights</b> of employees and the corresponding duties of employers, encompassing the right for information and consultation, protection against dismissal {{on the grounds of the}} transfer and the right for the same work conditions after the transfer. It covers a special case of transfer of undertaking in the case of transferor's insolvency. The third chapter deals with the regulation of transfer of undertaking under Czech law. Firstly, the chapter introduces the development of the provisions covering the transfer in the Labour Code. It {{focuses on the}} contemporary provisions of the Labour Code. It describes the grounds for the transfer covered by the Labour Code and particular statutes such as the Civil Code, [...] ...|$|E

40|$|To {{address the}} {{externalities}} {{that arise from}} local land uses, some communities in the United States have turned to Transferable Development Rights (TDRs) as a promising policy tool. TDRs separate the right to develop from the land itself, and create a market that allows those rights to be transferred from one location to another. If the markets work well, targeted areas are protected from development, thereby maintaining them as open space, buffers for water pollution control, wildlife habitat, or scenic vistas, or for other uses; the <b>transferred</b> <b>rights</b> are used to develop other areas more densely than would otherwise be the case. While TDRs have been established in many communities in the last 30 years, only a handful {{have been successful in}} achieving local land use goals. The design of TDR markets is complex because they must be integrated with local zoning regulations and they depend critically on local economic conditions in the housing and land markets. This article summarizes the key elements in the design of TDR programs and reviews a number of existing markets to identify which have performed well and which have not. The evolution of the successful markets is described, and lessons learned for future TDR programs are presented. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Section 338 par. 2 of the Labour Code as {{the reason}} of {{transference}} of rights and duties arising from labour relations This Thesis deals {{with the issue of}} legal transference of rights and duties arising from labour relations, which occurs due to the transfer of an employer's business activity or its part, or of an employer's tasks, or some of them, to another employer. The first chapters are devoted to the issues related to the moment of transfer of rights and duties arising from labour relations. Among these issues, identification of employees affected by the transfer and identification of <b>transferred</b> <b>rights</b> and duties including the possibility of their change may be regarded as the most important. The issues of equal treatment, possibility of termination of employment and obligation to inform and to consult are also discussed. After analyzing problematic areas associated with the transfer of rights and duties arising from labour relations, the Thesis focuses {{on the question of the}} interpretation of a "transfer" under Section 338 par. 2 of the Labour Code, with which the legal transfer of rights and duties is associated.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} shrimp {{industry in the}} Gulf of California from a political ecology perspective. The interaction between fishermen and their marine environment is explored, {{as well as the}} historical factors that led to vastly different types of fishermen in the communities of Guaymas and Empalme. Some have specialized in the harvesting of shrimp; others are diversified, multiple species fishermen. Some are highly industrialized offshore shrimpers; others are small-scale fishermen, more modest in their technology but more resilient when facing the current crisis in the shrimp industry. The underlaying causes of this crisis are explored by looking at state development policies, the assumptions behind fisheries management, and the configuration of markets. These have all emphasized specialization in the production of shrimp while ignoring the high interannual variability characteristic of shrimp populations. The end result: an overcapitalized, overexpanded industry and a possible overexploitation of shrimp stocks. Rather than addressing the root causes of the crisis, recent policies have instead <b>transferred</b> <b>rights</b> to the offshore fishery from cooperatives to private investors. At the same time there has been a concerted attack against small-scale producers. It is believed that by getting rid of this sector, catch per boat in the offshore sector will increase and overall "efficiency" will be improved. I compare industrialized trawlers and the small-scale sector and argue that the latter is currently producing high quality shrimp at lower monetary and ecological costs. But small-scale fishing is not equated with sustainability. Instead, differences among small-scale fishermen are analyzed. I contend that those who belong to traditional fishing families and have access to collective knowledge about the marine environment that has accumulated through generations, are better able to deal with a highly unpredictable environment and minimize risk. Those who {{do not have access to}} this knowledge have specialized in the harvesting of shrimp. I argue that a strategy of diversification is both more profitable in the short-term and sustainable in the long-run. Avoidance strategies among small-scale fishermen in response to externally imposed regulations are also examined. Fishermen are analyzed as individual profit maximizers and as community members who break the rules to serve collective interests. Just as individuals act collectively to deal with an unpredictable environment, they also act collectively to effectively challenge the institutions of rule-making...|$|E
