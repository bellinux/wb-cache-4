5|$|Two {{days after}} the {{television}} appearance, on 11 February 1964, the Beatles' first U.S. concert took place, at Washington Coliseum, a sports arena in Washington, D.C. The concert was attended by eight thousand fans. The Beatles performed on a central stage in the arena, with the audience on all sides, and there were regular pauses to enable the band to turn their equipment around and perform facing in another direction. The concert generated intense excitement. The following day, the Beatles performed a second concert, in Carnegie Hall, New York, which was attended by two thousand fans. The concert was again well received. Following the Carnegie Hall concert, the Beatles flew to Miami Beach and on Sunday 16 February 1964 made their second television appearance on <b>The</b> <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> Show, which this time was broadcast live from the Napoleon Ballroom of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach. As it had done on 9 February, the television broadcast attracted around 70million viewers. On 22 February 1964, the Beatles returned to the UK. Arriving at Heathrow airport at 7 am, they were met by an estimated ten thousand fans.|$|E
5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on <b>The</b> <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was so big that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E
5|$|Because the Supremes {{were popular}} with white {{audience}}s {{as well as}} with black ones, Gordy had the group cater to its middle American audience with performances at renowned supper clubs such as the Copacabana in New York. Broadway and pop standards were incorporated into their repertoire alongside their own hit songs. As a result, the Supremes {{became one of the first}} black musical acts to achieve complete and sustained crossover success. Black rock and roll musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes' success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross's pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers with rock and roll songs underpinned by R stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as Hullabaloo, The Hollywood Palace, The Della Reese Show, and, most notably, <b>The</b> <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> Show, on which they made 17 appearances. The Supremes' cross-cultural success effectively paved the way for the mainstream success of contemporaneous label mates such as the Temptations, the Four Tops and the Jackson 5.|$|E
40|$|Managing {{death in}} <b>the</b> {{emergency}} department (<b>ED)</b> is a challenge. Emergency nurses {{are expected to}} provide care to numerous patient groups in an often fast-paced, life-saving environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the experiences of emergency nurses in providing end-of-life (EOL) care in <b>the</b> <b>ED.</b> EOL care is the care delivered to a patient during the time directly preceding death. Data were collected from 25 emergency nurses by focus group interview. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using the qualitative techniques of grounded theory. Ten categories emerged from the data that described a social process for managing death in <b>the</b> <b>ED.</b> <b>The</b> categories were linked via the core category labelled 'dying in <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> is not ideal'. Dying in <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> is not ideal described how <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> was an inappropriate place for death to occur. To help manage the influence of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> environment on EOL care, emergency nurses described a social process that reported strategies that included moving dying patients out of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> and providing <b>the</b> best EOL care that they could with the facilities that they had. The presence of contextual determinants related to treatment orders, knowing a patient's wishes, and patient circumstances influenced the application of the strategies. However when the strategies failed, the consequences of death in <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> were based on the inability of emergency nurses to provide a dying patient with a 'good' death. The results of this study highlight emergency nurses' belief that <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> is not an appropriate place for death to occur. The perception of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> as an inappropriate setting for death suggests the lack of fit of EOL care pathways as a solution to meet the EOL care needs of dying patients in <b>the</b> <b>ED...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{influence}} self-referral, it {{is crucial}} to know a patient's motives to directly visit <b>the</b> emergency department (<b>ED).</b> <b>The</b> goal {{of this study is to}} examine motives for self-referral to <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> and compare these motives in relation to appropriateness. METHODS: All self-referred patients visiting <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> of a Dutch hospital over four separate months in a 1 -year period were included. Patients were handed questionnaires that included questions on their reasons to visit <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> directly and where they would seek medical help next time. Additionally, the motives of patients that either appropriately or inappropriately visited <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> were compared. In a previous study on the same patient cohort, the appropriateness of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> visits was determined using predefined criteria. RESULTS: A total of 3196 self-referred patients were included, and 48. 9 % completed the questionnaires. The majority of patients (28. 0 %) attended <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> without a referral because they thought they would get help faster; the next reason was the easier access to radiologic and laboratory investigations (answered by 23. 8 %); and the third was the symptoms were considered too severe to visit a general practitioner (GP) (answered by 22. 7 %). The majority (78. 5 %) would attend <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> <b>the</b> next time they are faced with similar symptoms. Appropriate visits were significantly more seen in females, elderly, and patients in higher triage categories. Patients who expect investigations are necessary, think their symptoms are too severe to visit a GP, or would return to <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> next time were more often appropriately visiting <b>the</b> <b>ED.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> choice of patients to self-refer to an ED is often an explicate decision. Patients are looking for specialist help and want fast and easy access to radiologic and laboratory investigations. Even though the primary care network is well developed in the Netherlands, the reasons for self-referral are similar to the reasons found in previous literature based in other countries.

40|$|Background and objective: Return visits (RVs) to a {{pediatric}} emergency department (ED) {{within a short}} period after discharge have an influence on overcrowding of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> and reveal some weaknesses {{of the health care}} system. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the rate of RVs and factors related to RVs to <b>the</b> pediatric <b>ED</b> in Lithuania. Materials and methods: A retrospective study in an urban, tertiary-level teaching hospital was carried out. Electronic medical records of all patients (n =  44   097) visiting <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> of this hospital between 1 January and 31 December 2013 were analyzed. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who return to <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> within 72  h and those who had not visited <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> were compared. Factors associated with RVs were determined by multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of <b>the</b> overall <b>ED</b> population, 33   889 patients were discharged home after the initial assessment. A total of 1015 patients returned to <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> within 72  h, giving a RV rate of 3. 0 %. Being a 0 – 7 -year old, visiting <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> during weekdays, having a GP referral, receiving of laboratory tests and ultrasound on the initial visit were associated with greater likelihoods of returning to <b>the</b> <b>ED.</b> Patients who arrived to <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> from 8 : 01  a. m. to 4 : 00  p. m. and underwent radiological test were less likely to return to <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> within 72  h. Diseases such as gastrointestinal disorders or respiratory tract/earth–nose–throat (ENT) diseases and symptoms such as fever or pain were significantly associated with returning to <b>the</b> <b>ED.</b> <b>The</b> initial diagnosis corresponded to the diagnosis made on the second visit for only 44. 1 % of the patients, and the highest rate of the congruity in diagnosis was for injuries/poisoning, surgical pathologies (77. 2 %) and respiratory tract diseases (76. 9 %). Conclusions: RVs accounted for only a small proportion of visits to <b>the</b> <b>ED.</b> RVs were more prevalent among younger patients and patients with a GP referral as well as performed more often after discharging from <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> in <b>the</b> evening and at night...|$|R

40|$|Throughout the day, arrivals of {{patients}} at <b>the</b> emergency department (<b>ED)</b> are unannounced, unpredictable and fully determined by chance. Healthcare professionals in <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> naturally react {{as quickly as}} possible when patients arrive. We wondered whether they could somehow act in advance. We introduced a planning system that enabled <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> to regulate arrival times of emergency patients referred by the general practitioner. The system established direct contact between the general practitioner and <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> at <b>the</b> press of a button. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> was able to schedule a fraction of its unpredictable patient demand. Implementation of the system at large was unsuccessful however. Changing the nature of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> turned out to be far more difficult than expected. In our opinion, successfully planning emergency patients requires that <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> has full control over the referral process, and that scheduled patients are treated in a separate, undisturbed care process.

40|$|The {{extensor}} digitorum communis (ED) {{is generally}} regarded as a fairly undiversified muscle that gives extensor tendons to all fingers. Some fine wire electromyographic (EMG) investigations {{have been carried out}} to study individuation of the muscle parts to the different fingers. However, individuated surface EMG of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> has not been investigated. This study analyses the anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> muscle parts to the different fingers in detail and proposes optimal locations for surface or indwelling electrodes for individuated EMG and for electrostimulation with neuroprostheses. The dissections show that <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> arises from extensive origin tendons (OT), which originate at the lateral epicondyle and reach far in <b>the</b> forearm. <b>The</b> <b>ED</b> OT is V-shaped with shorter central tendon fibers but with a long radial and an even longer ulnar slip. <b>The</b> <b>ED</b> parts to <b>the</b> individual fingers consistently arise from distinct OT locations: <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> 3 (medius) arises proximally, <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> 2 (index) from the radial slip distal to <b>ED</b> 3, <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> 4 (ring finger) from the ulnar slip distal to <b>ED</b> 3, and <b>the</b> <b>ED</b> 5 (to ring/little finger) from the ulnar slip distal to ED 4. This lengthwise widely spaced arrangement of ED parts compensates to some degree for <b>the</b> narrow <b>ED</b> width and suggests that ED parts should be individually assessable by indwelling and even by surface EMG electrodes, albeit in the latter case with variable mutual cross-talk. Conversely, the anatomic spacing of ED parts warrants that electromyographic stimulation with neuroprostheses by a single implanted electrode cannot likely homogeneously activate all ED parts.
