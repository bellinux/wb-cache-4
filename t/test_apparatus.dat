They {{were able to}} solve problems such as two birds having to pull strings {{at the same time to}} obtain food. In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the <b>test</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Both would then feed. The birds were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized. The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging {{the right amount of}} water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.|$|E

500|$|Slotted {{lines are}} {{relatively}} cheap and can perform {{many of the}} measurements done by more expensive equipment such as network analysers. [...] However, slotted line measurement techniques are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required. [...] In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus frequency is very time consuming. [...] This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and spectrum analysers which are intrinsically frequency swept and produce a plot instantly. [...] Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where capital costs are an issue. [...] Their remaining uses are mostly in the millimetre band, where modern <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists. [...] They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{transitions}} from one state to another are gradual, the tests have adopted arbitrary definitions {{to determine the}} boundaries of the states. The liquid limit is determined by measuring [...] the water content for which a groove closes after 25 blows in a standard test. Alternatively, a fall cone <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> may be use to measure the liquid limit. The undrained shear strength of remolded soil at the liquid limit is approximately 2 kPa. The Plastic Limit is the water content below which {{it is not possible to}} roll by hand the soil into 3mm diameter cylinders. [...] The soil cracks or breaks up as it is rolled down to this diameter. Remolded soil at the plastic limit is quite stiff, having an undrained shear strength of the order of about 200 kPa.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 {{after the}} breakup of [...] during re-entry, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{conducted}} tests at Southwest Research Institute, which used an air gun to shoot foam blocks of similar size, mass and speed to that which struck Columbia at a test structure which mechanically replicated the orbiter wing leading edge. They removed a fiberglass panel from Enterprise wing to perform analysis of the material and attached it to the test structure, then shot a foam block at it. [...] While the panel was not broken {{as a result of}} the test, the impact was enough to permanently deform a seal. Since the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panel on Columbia had only 40% of the strength of the test panel from Enterprise, this result suggested that the RCC leading edge would have been shattered. Additional tests on the fiberglass were canceled in order not to risk damaging the <b>test</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and a panel from Discovery was tested to determine the effects of the foam on a similarly-aged RCC leading edge. On July 7, 2003, a foam impact test created a hole [...] in the protective RCC panel. The tests clearly demonstrated that a foam impact of the type Columbia sustained could seriously breach the protective RCC panels on the wing leading edge.|$|E

60|$|Blind {{persons are}} reputed to have {{acquired}} in {{compensation for the}} loss of their eyesight an increased acuteness in their other senses; I was therefore curious to make some trials with my <b>test</b> <b>apparatus,</b> which I will describe in the next chapter. I was permitted to do so on a number of boys at a large educational blind asylum, but found that, although they were anxious to do their best, their performances were by no means superior to those of other boys. It so happened that the blind lads who showed the most delicacy of touch and won the little prizes I offered to excite emulation, barely reached the mediocrity of the various sighted lads of the same age whom I had previously tested. I have made not a few observations and inquiries, and find that the guidance of the blind depends mainly on the multitude of collateral indications to which they give much heed, and not in their superior sensitivity to any one of them. Those who see do not care for so many of these collateral indications, and habitually overlook and neglect several of them. I am convinced also that not a little of the popular belief concerning the sensitivity of the blind is due to exaggerated claims on their part that have not been verified. Two instances of this have fallen within my own experience, in both of which the blind persons claimed to have the power of judging by the echo of their voice and by certain other feelings, the one when they were approaching objects, even though the object was so small as a handrail, and the other to tell how far the door of the room in which he was standing was open. I used all the persuasion I could to induce each of these persons to allow me to put their assertions to the test; but it was of no use. The one made excuses, the other positively refused. They had probably the same tendency that others would have who happened to be defective in any faculty that their comrades possessed, to fight bravely against their disadvantage, {{and at the same time}} to be betrayed into some overvaunting of their capacities in other directions. They would be a little conscious of this, and would therefore shrink from being tested.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explore the possibility of using aligned Carbon Nanotube (CNT) based composites in flexures by measuring the kinematics of a composite flexure. The first phase of the research, described in this thesis, is to design, fabricate and assemble a <b>testing</b> <b>apparatus</b> optimized for evaluating aligned CNT based composites. Using existing literature on composites and present limitations on their growth, functional requirements are set down for the <b>testing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Several designs are qualitatively evaluated, leading to a near optimal design form. This chosen design is modeled as a spring-mass system, and the exact geometry needed to satisfy the functional requirements is determined. The design of the full apparatus is expanded to contain the necessary probes and actuators. The <b>testing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is fabricated using CNC machining, and assembled in a controlled environment to reduce thermal and mechanical error during operation. The system is calibrated and its resolution is found to be 0. 021 N over a range of 28. 5 N applied force and 1. 5 pm over a range of 816 pm applied displacement. Several non-linearities are noted and corrected mathematically. by Robert M. Panas. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2007.
