5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the loggerhead, including vital organs, such as {{the heart and the}} brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E

5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae.

Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae.

5|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is distributed <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in stress situations.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E

The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E

5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} bones from {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic. This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E

5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
