Dickens <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Thackeray. And the final and startling triumph of Dickens is this: that even to this moderate and modern story, he gives an incomparable energy which is not moderate and which is not modern. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasonable; {{but in spite of}} himself he is inspired. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detailed, but in spite of himself he <b>is</b> gigantic.

25|$|Chibiusa {{started out}} {{socially}} awkward, she quickly became popular with her classmates. In the manga, she once {{became president of}} her class. Her initial shyness {{could be attributed to}} {{the fact that she was}} teased in the 30th-century for not having any Soldier powers. As the manga progresses, she gradually matures, becoming more comfortable with herself and more confident with her Soldier abilities. Because her dream in the manga is to become a beautiful lady, her actions often are based around this. She <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a perfectionist and starts off trying to do everything alone and for herself. This view evolves as she realizes what maturity really is and what it really means to be an adult. In the original anime, she is more judgmental and does not mature as much as her manga counterpart. But she does in Sailor Moon Crystal and gets along better with Usagi.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} person, as if quoting himself, William speaks {{about how his}} {{disagreement}} with his king troubles him; he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> faithful to his king, but he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. Therefore, the last two lines of the first stanza, indicate that {{the leader of the}} Dutch civil war against the Spanish Empire of which they were part, had no specific quarrel with king Philip II of Spain, but rather with his emissaries in the Low Countries, like Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. This may have been because at the time (late 16th century) it was uncommon to publicly doubt the Divine Right of Kings, who was accountable to God alone. In 1581 the Netherlands nevertheless rejected the legitimacy of the king of Spain's rule over it in the Act of Abjuration.|$|E
