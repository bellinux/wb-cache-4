Molecular markers {{are useful}} tool to support {{selection}} criteria in breeding programs. Before applying in molecular characterization of individuals, protocol requires a standardization process. Therefore, {{this study aims}} to validate AFLP method for use in conservation and breeding activities in Dipteryx panamensis (<b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> <b>tree).</b> Two main groups selected from progeny in natural population of D. panamensis in Zona Norte of Costa Rica were sampled. Individuals related were grouped in families. Six AFLP primer combinations were selected (E-AC/M-CTG, E-AAT/M-CTG, E-ACA/M-CTG, E-ACC/M-CTG, E-AGC/M-CTG y E-ATC/M-CTG), {{and a total of}} 242 loci were analyzed. In average, each family presented a Nei’s diversity index of 0, 120 and 33 % PLP, and Family 1 was the most diverse group. AMOVA analysis indicated the main genetic variation was among individuals (69 %). Based on Nei’s genetic distances (1978) UPGMA, NJ and PCA cluster analysis have been realized. AFLP data were used to construct dendrograms among and within families, and to meet kinship relations. In conclusion, use of AFLP protocol in Dipteryx panamensis, allowed reliable results genetic diversity and distance, and can applied in future researchInstituto Tecnológico de Costa Ric...|$|E
40|$|The β-glucosides of coumarinic and o-coumaric acids were {{detected}} in extracts of cotyledons, exocarps, and seedling {{leaves of the}} <b>tonka</b> <b>bean.</b> The existence of these compounds {{and the presence of}} a β-glucosidase having specificity for coumarinyl glucoside suggest that, the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> synthesizes coumarin by a pathway similar to the one found in sweetclover...|$|R

50|$|<b>Tonka</b> <b>bean</b> oil is {{extracted}} from the seed of Dipteryx odorata. The oil is composed primarily of coumarin, {{which is used to}} flavor tobacco. It is neither a pressed oil, nor an essential oil, but was traditionally obtained by soaking the large, single <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> seed in rum or other alcohol for 24 hours, after which crystals of coumarin appear {{on the outside of the}} seed, and are then collected. The seeds contain up to 46% oil by dry weight. In recent years, most commercially produced coumarin are synthetic, which has reduced the demand for <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> as a crop. Coumarin derivatives are also used medicinally, as anti-coagulants.|$|R
25|$|Seeds: Commonly used seeds include <b>tonka</b> <b>bean,</b> carrot seed, coriander, caraway, cocoa, nutmeg, mace, cardamom, and anise.|$|R
50|$|The {{fragrance}} has {{notes of}} sandalwood, vetiver, <b>tonka</b> <b>bean,</b> vanilla, ylang ylang, iris, coriander, rose, jasmine, and aldehydes.|$|R
50|$|Coumarin {{is derived}} from coumarou, the French word for the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean.</b> The word <b>tonka</b> for the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> is taken from the Galibi (Carib) tongue spoken by natives of French Guiana (one source for the plant); it also appears in Old Tupi, another {{language}} of the same region, as {{the name of the}} tree. The old genus name, Coumarouna, was formed from another Tupi name for tree, kumarú.|$|R
50|$|Marketed as for women, this {{fragrance}} mainly made of bergamot, lemon, spices, carnation, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, orange blossom, <b>tonka</b> <b>bean,</b> musk, benzoin, oakmoss, {{vanilla and}} sandalwood.|$|R
5000|$|Mexican vanilla, {{made from}} the native V. planifolia, is {{produced}} in much less quantity and marketed as the vanilla {{from the land of}} its origin. Vanilla sold in tourist markets around Mexico is sometimes not actual vanilla extract, but is mixed with an extract of the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean,</b> which contains the toxin coumarin. <b>Tonka</b> <b>bean</b> extract smells and tastes like vanilla, but coumarin has been shown to cause liver damage in lab animals and has been banned in food in the US by the Food and Drug Administration since 1954.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tonka</b> <b>beans</b> {{had been}} used as a vanilla substitute, as a perfume, and in tobacco before being banned in some countries. They are used in some French cuisine (particularly, in desserts and stews) and in perfumes.|$|R
2500|$|Gourmand (...) : scents with [...] "edible" [...] or [...] "dessert"-like qualities. These often contain notes like vanilla, <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> and coumarin, {{as well as}} {{synthetic}} components {{designed to}} resemble food flavors. A sweet example is Thierry Mugler's Angel.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in a {{plantation}} of a degraded area in Central Amazon, Brazil, in order to assess environmental light effects on leaf pigment concentrations and chlorophyll a fluorescence in mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) and <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> (Dipteryx odorata Aubl. Willd). Three-year old saplings were grown in an open site (sun) with maximum radiation of approximately 2000 mumol m- 2 s- 1 and under the shade of a Ochroma pyramidale (Cav. ex Lam. Urb) canopy. A leaf area index of 2. 46 was optically determined for the Ochroma foliage with 13 % of full sunlight (maximum radiation about 260 mumol m- 2 s- 1). Carotenoid and chlorophyll concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined. Initial (Fo), maximum (Fm) and variable fluorescence (Fv) were determined with a portable fluorometer. Chlorophyll concentrations (Chl a, Chl b and Chl tot) on a fresh mass basis were greater in shade leaves than in sun acclimated leaves in both species. On the other hand, when comparisons were made on a per area basis, Chl a concentrations were greater in the sun than in shade leaves of <b>tonka</b> <b>bean.</b> In contrast, Chl b concentrations were higher in the shade environment for this species. No differences were observed in Chl concentrations per unit area in mahogany leaves. Carotenoid concentrations were higher for sun-acclimated leaves of mahogany, both on a per unit area and on a fresh mass basis. In <b>tonka</b> <b>bean,</b> higher carotenoid concentrations in shade leaves were only observed on a fresh weight basis. No differences were found between environments when carotenoid concentrations were expressed as a function of leaf area. Fluorescence variables (Fo, Fm, and Fv) were greater in sun leaves than in shade leaves of mahogany. In contrast, Fv and Fm, but not Fo, values were higher in shade acclimated leaves than in full sunlight-adapted leaves of <b>tonka</b> <b>bean.</b> However, there was a higher Fv/Fm ratio value for <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> in sunlight environments. We conclude that these species, classified as mid and late successional species, differ markedly regarding the utilization of photosynthetic pigments, increasing either light harvesting efficiency at low irradiance or protection against photosynthetic machinery damage in higher solar radiation environments...|$|R
50|$|The perfume was {{developed}} by Frank Voelkl as an oriental - woody. In the top notes there are bergamot, clementine, black pepper and rosemary. The heart consists of cedar, jasmine, vanilla orchid and labdanum, leaning {{on the base of}} sandalwood, patchouli, amber, musk and <b>tonka</b> <b>bean.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{fragrance}} {{released on}} 16 September 2006 to selected European countries and then released the United States in January 2007. The notes consisted of osmanthus, ripe red berries and cyclamen, notes of orchid, gardenia and fresh freesia {{as well as}} notes of amber, sandalwood and <b>tonka</b> <b>beans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} calls for {{removing}} {{the restrictions on}} the use of <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> in food in the United States. The regulations are criticized as unreasonable due to the unlikelihood of consuming enough coumarin to cause ill effects and due to the presence of coumarin in unregulated foods.|$|R

5000|$|Dipteryx odorata (commonly {{known as}} [...] "cumaru" [...] or [...] "kumaru") is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} tree in the pea family, Fabaceae. The tree is native to Central America and northern South America. Its seeds are known as <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> (sometimes tonkin beans or tonquin beans). They are black and wrinkled and have a smooth, brown interior. They have a strong fragrance similar to sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) due to their high content of coumarin.|$|R
50|$|Coumarin {{is found}} {{naturally}} in many plants, notably in high {{concentration in the}} <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> (Dipteryx odorata), vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum), mullein (Verbascum spp.), sweet grass (Hierochloe odorata), cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) {{not to be confused}} with true cinnamon ("Ceylon cinnamon", Cinnamomum zeylanicum which contains little coumarin), sweet-clover (Melilotus sp.), deertongue (Dichanthelium clandestinum), and the leaves of many cherry blossom tree varieties (of the Prunus genus). Coumarin is also found in extracts of Justicia pectoralis.|$|R

500|$|Warfarin is a {{derivative}} of dicoumarol, an anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover. Dicoumarol, in turn, is from coumarin, a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found in [...] "sweet" [...] clover and <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> (also known as cumaru from which coumarin's name derives). The name warfarin stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin, incorporating the acronym {{for the organization}} that funded the key research, WARF for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the ending -arin, indicating its link with coumarin.|$|R
40|$|The 70 new {{combinations}} made in Forsyth’s ‘A botanical nomenclator’ (1794) include ten {{names in}} current use, but hitherto attributed to later authors, notable being {{that of the}} economically significant Dipteryx odorata (<b>tonka</b> <b>bean),</b> Leguminosae. Of Forsyth’s 26 nomina nova, Psychotria caerulea Forsyth f. (1794) is an older name for the homotypic P. amplifolia Raeusch. (1797), Rubiaceae. Also pointed out are four names in current use to be cited as of Lamarck and one as of Räuschel, rather than later authors. All other novelties, none apparently affecting current nomenclature, have been passed to IPNI editors...|$|R
50|$|Generally {{the lowland}} rain {{forests in the}} north hold trees {{associated}} with cow tree (Brosimum utile), with groves of bongo (Cavanillesia platanifolia), wild cashew (Anacardium excelsum), Panama rubber (Castilla elastica), snakewood or bastard breadnut (Brosimum guianense), Bombacopsis species, kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra) and <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> (Dipteryx panamensis). There are large emergent trees that rise above the canopy.The understory is rich is Mabea occidentalis and Clidemia, Conostegia and Miconia species. Periodically flooded areas are often rich in cativo (Prioria copaifera).The southern part the rain forest has two strata of trees, and large emergent trees, with flourishing lianas and epiphytes.|$|R
5000|$|Coumarin {{was first}} {{isolated}} from <b>Tonka</b> <b>beans</b> and sweet clover in 1820 by A. Vogel of Munich, who initially mistook it for benzoic acid. Also in 1820, Nicholas Jean Baptiste Gaston Guibourt (1790-1867) of France independently isolated coumarin, but {{he realized that}} it was not benzoic acid. [...] In a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of the Académie Royale de Médecine, Guibourt named the new substance [...] "coumarine". In 1835, the French pharmacist A. Guillemette proved that Vogel and Guibourt had isolated the same substance. [...] Coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 by the English chemist William Henry Perkin.|$|R
