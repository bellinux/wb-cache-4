40|$|The N-terminal <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> of {{the core}} histones play {{important}} roles in gene regulation, but the exact mechanisms through which they act are not known. Recent {{studies suggest that the}} <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> may influence the ability of RNA polymerase to elongate through the nucleosomal DNA and, thus, that posttranslational modification of the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> may provide a control point for gene regulation through effects on the elongation rate. We take advantage of an experimental system that uses bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase as a probe for aspects of nucleosome transcription that are dominated by the properties of nucleosomes themselves. With this system, experiments can analyze the synchronous, real-time, single-passage transcription on the nucleosomal template. Here, we use this system to directly test the hypothesis that the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> may influence the “elongatability” of nucleosomal DNA and to identify which of the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> may contribute to this. The results show that the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> strongly influence the rate of elongation and suggest that the effect is dominated by the N-terminal domains of the (H 3 -H 4) 2 tetramer. They further imply that tail-mediated octamer transfer is not essential for elongation through the nucleosome. Acetylation of the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> leads to effects on elongation that are similar to those arising from complete removal of the <b>tail</b> <b>domains...</b>|$|R
40|$|Reconstitution of a DNA {{fragment}} {{containing a}} 5 S RNA gene from Xenopus borealis into a nucleosome greatly restricts binding {{of the primary}} 5 S transcription factor, TFIIIA. Consistent with transcription experiments using reconstituted templates, removal of the histone <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> stimulates TFIIIA binding to the 5 S nucleosome greater than 100 -fold. However, we show that tail removal increases the probability of 5 S DNA unwrapping from the core histone surface by only approximately fivefold. Moreover, using site-specific histone-to-DNA cross-linking, we show that TFIIIA binding neither induces nor requires nucleosome movement. Binding studies with COOH-terminal deletion mutants of TFIIIA and 5 S nucleosomes reconstituted with native and tailless core histones indicate that the core histone <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> play a direct role in restricting the binding of TFIIIA. Deletion of only the COOH-terminal transcription activation domain dramatically stimulates TFIIIA binding to the native nucleosome, while further C-terminal deletions or removal of the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> {{does not lead to}} further increases in TFIIIA binding. We conclude that the unmodified core histone <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> directly negatively influence TFIIIA binding to the nucleosome in a manner that requires the C-terminal transcription activation domain of TFIIIA.

40|$|Reconstitution of a DNA {{fragment}} {{containing a}} Xenopus borealis somatic type 5 S rRNA gene into a nucleosome greatly restricts the binding of transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) to its cognate DNA sequence within the internal promoter of the gene. Removal of all core histone <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> by limited trypsin proteolysis or acetylation {{of the core}} histone tails significantly relieves this inhibition and allows TFIIIA to exhibit high-affinity binding to nucleosomal DNA. Since only a single tail or a subset of tails may be primarily responsible for this effect, we determined whether removal of the individual <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> of the H 2 A-H 2 B dimer or the H 3 -H 4 tetramer affects TFIIIA binding to its cognate DNA site within the 5 S nucleosome in vitro. The {{results show that the}} <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> of H 3 and H 4, but not those of H 2 A and/or H 2 B, directly modulate the ability of TFIIIA to bind nucleosomal DNA. In vitro transcription assays carried out with nucleosomal templates lacking individual <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> show that transcription efficiency parallels the binding of TFIIIA. In addition, we show that the stoichiometry of core histones within the 5 S DNA-core histone-TFIIIA triple complex is not changed upon TFIIIA association. Thus, TFIIIA binding occurs by displacement of H 2 A-H 2 B–DNA contacts but without complete loss of the dimer from the nucleoprotein complex. These data, coupled with previous reports (M. Vettese-Dadey, P. A. Grant, T. R. Hebbes, C. Crane-Robinson, C. D. Allis, and J. L. Workman, EMBO J. 15 : 2508 – 2518, 1996; L. Howe, T. A. Ranalli, C. D. Allis, and J. Ausio, J. Biol.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the contribution of}} cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (IFs), their subunit proteins, and their interactions with organelles and other components of the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton of a typical eukaryotic cell consists of three filament systems—that is, microfilaments, IFs, and microtubules—as {{well as a number}} of filament-associated proteins that cross-link these systems to each other and to cell organelles. The polymerization of IF proteins is not obligatorily dependent on either accessory (protein) cofactors or exogenous energy sources, such as ATP. The entire IF proteins share a common secondary structure consisting of three distinct domains—namely, non-α-helical head, <b>tail</b> <b>domains,</b> and rod domain. The non-α-helical head and <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> are primarily responsible for the unique reactivities or properties of the IF proteins, while the rod domain is primarily responsible for the one property all of these diverse proteins share: the ability to polymerize into 10 -nm filaments...|$|R

Proteolytic removal of the core histone <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> inhibits but does not completely abolish rSir 3 p binding to nucleosomal arrays.

Together these data indicate that rSir 3 p cross-links individual nucleosomal arrays into supramolecular assemblies whose physical properties transcend those of typical 10 -nm and 30 -nm fibers.

By following the behavior of spin labels during the process of in vitro assembly, we show that head domain structure is dynamic, changing as a result of filament assembly.

40|$|Eliminating {{assembled}} neurofilaments (NFs) from axons or misaccumulating NFs {{in motor}} neuron cell bodies strongly slows disease in mouse models of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) -induced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One proposal for how reducing axonal NFs can increase survival {{is that the}} multiphosphorylated <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> of the two larger NF subunits act in motor neuron cell bodies as phosphorylation sinks where they mitigate cyclin-dependent kinase 5 dysregulation induced by mutant SOD 1. Elimination by gene targeting in mice of the NF medium and NF heavy <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> and their 58 known phosphorylation sites accelerates aberrant phosphorylation of other neuronal substrates while leaving overall NF content unaltered. However, disease onset is significantly delayed and survival is extended, inconsistent with the ameliorative property of altered NF content protecting by serving as substrates for dysregulation of any NF kinase. Moreover, at comparable disease stages significantly more surviving motor neurons and axons were found in SOD 1 mutant mice deleted in the NF tails than in similar mice with wild-type NFs. This finding supports noncell autonomous toxicity in SOD 1 mutant-mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: removal of the NF tails slows damage developed directly within motor neurons, but SOD 1 mutant damage within nonneuronal supporting cells reduces motor neuron functionality...|$|R

Like the neurofilament triplet proteins, alpha-internexin coassembles with vimentin into filaments. To study the assembly characteristics of these proteins {{in the absence of a}} preexisting filament network, transient transfection experiments were performed with a non-neuronal cell line lacking cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. The results showed that only alpha-internexin was able to self-assemble into extensive filamentous networks. In contrast, the neurofilament triplet proteins were incapable of homopolymeric assembly into filamentous arrays in vivo. NF-L coassembled with either NF-M or NF-H into filamentous structures in the transfected cells, but NF-M could not form filaments with NF-H. alpha- internexin could coassemble with each of the neurofilament triplet proteins in the transfected cells to form filaments. When all but 2 and 10 amino acid residues were removed from the <b>tail</b> <b>domains</b> of NF-L and NF-M, respectively, the resulting NF-L and NF-M deletion mutants retained the ability to coassemble with alpha-internexin into filamentous networks.
