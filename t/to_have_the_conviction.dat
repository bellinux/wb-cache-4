50|$|California {{has several}} post-conviction {{remedies}} that are sometimes called expungement.

50|$|Death {{sentences}} {{were passed}} on 11 people after the 1964 Act, for 5 different incidents involving the capital {{murder of a}} total of 6 Gardaí (police). All were imposed by the Special Criminal Court. The murders of several other gardaí, and of British ambassador Christopher Ewart-Biggs in 1976, might also have constituted capital crimes had any prosecution been brought. Of the 11 sentenced <b>to</b> death, 2 <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> for capital murder quashed on appeal, and were convicted instead of ordinary murder. The death sentences of the other 9 were commuted by the President on the advice of the government, to 40 years' imprisonment without parole. One conviction was overturned in 1995. The 40-year sentences were controversial, both because they had no statutory basis, and because they were not handed down by a judge. The Court of Criminal Appeal <b>has</b> upheld <b>the</b> sentences as the extra-judicial procedure is in step with the Irish Constitution's provision for commuting sentences.|$|R
50|$|At {{the death}} of Pope Paul IV in 1559, the Roman mob looted {{buildings}} and burned records. Palaeologus escaped from prison when a mob stormed {{the headquarters of the}} Roman Inquisition and released inmates. Although evidence against him was destroyed, he was subsequently tried in absentia by a Roman Inquisition tribunal, convicted, sentenced to death in 1561, and burned in effigy. Palaeologus escaped initially to France, where, in 1562, he unsuccessfully petitioned Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, <b>the</b> papal legate, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Inquisition heresy <b>conviction</b> overturned. Then later in 1562, realising that he was also not safe or welcome among Reformed Protestants because of his virulent denunciations of Calvinism, he offered help to Andreas Dudith, Bishop of Knin and the imperial representative at the Council of Trent. Palaeologus advised Dudith in the presentation to the Council of the imperial arguments for permitting Utraquism, the distribution of both bread and wine to the laity at Holy Communion; and in exchange Dudith attempted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Palaeologus' heresy <b>conviction</b> by <b>the</b> Inquisition overturned by the Ecumenical Council, stirring up in the process a major disruption to the Council's proceedings. Eventually in 1563, Palaeologus was granted imperial asylum in Prague; and when the new Emperor Maximilian II succeeded in 1564, Palaeologus advanced in the imperial favour. Following the example of his patron Dudith, Palaeologus renounced his religious vows, marrying the daughter of a leading Prague reformer. In 1569, Palaeologus was proposed to the emperor as the Utraquist candidate to the office of Archbishop of Prague. This was however blocked by Ghislieri, his sworn enemy, who was now pope; and who eventually contrived <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Palaeologus expelled from the imperial dominions to Poland in 1571, where he was reunited in Kraków with Dudith, who was now the imperial representative to the Kingdom of Poland. Palaeologus was openly advancing antitrinitarian views but became embroiled in a bitter controversy with Gregory Paul of Brzeziny and the Ecclesia Minor over the Polish antitrinitarians' condemnation of Christian service in the military.|$|R

50|$|Individuals {{convicted and}} imprisoned for {{homosexual}} offences prior to August 1986 are not automatically eligible {{to hide the}} offences under the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004, since the Act applies retrospectively to current and abolished offences equally. However, individuals with an otherwise clean criminal record can apply to a District Court <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> disregarded. However, this process only conceals these convictions - it does not erase them altogether. On 28 June 2017, the Government introduced the Criminal Records (Expungement of Convictions for Historical Homosexual Offences) Bill which would allow men convicted for homosexual offences to apply to wipe out their convictions from the records. On 6 July, the bill had its first reading. Justice Minister Amy Adams moved a motion to apologise for convictions the same day, to which Parliament agreed unanimously.|$|E

[...] Acquittal by directed verdict is also final and cannot be appealed by the prosecution. An acquittal in a trial by judge (bench trial) is also generally not appealable by the prosecution. A trial judge may normally enter an acquittal if he deems the evidence insufficient for conviction. If the judge makes this ruling before the jury reaches its verdict, the judge's determination is final. If, however, the judge overrules a conviction by the jury, the prosecution may appeal <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> reinstated.

40|$|In April 2001, Hymon stole a purse from a {{woman in}} the lobby of an auto repair shop. He ran, and two of the shop’s {{mechanics}} pursued him. They caught up to him when he fell on the curb, but he stood and swung a four- to six-inch long pocketknife. They backed away, allowing him to escape, but the police apprehended him shortly thereafter. After Hymon requested to represent himself, the district court conducted a Faretta canvass, 2 and concluded that Hymon was competent to waive his right to counsel. Hymon was uncooperative and unwilling to communicate with the prosecutor, so the district court revoked Hymon’s right to represent himself and appointed counsel. At a calendar call in November 2001, Hymon claimed he was being represented against his will and denied his right to selfrepresentation. The district court conducted another Faretta canvass, during which Hymon again gave appropriate responses. However, the district court was concerned with Hymon’s understanding of his available defenses – one of his main reasons for wanting to represent himself was that his counsel would not present the defense he wanted (denial of due process). The district court allowed Hymon to represent himself, but also appointed standby counsel. During the trial, Hymon was ordered to wear a stun belt because of a letter he <b>had</b> sent. <b>The</b> letter requested that the Civil Rights Volunteers make the district court judge recuse himself, and also stated, “If I <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> I will murder him. ” In trial, Hymon focused on the violation of his rights, and, as an example, opened his clothes to reveal the stun belt. Following a guilty verdict, the State presented certified copies of Hymon’s prior <b>convictions,</b> and <b>the</b> district court found Hymon to be a habitual criminal. However, the State never requested <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> judgments of <b>conviction</b> admitted, and <b>the</b> district court never stated that they were admitted. On appeal, Hymon asserted that the district court: (1) should have promptly disclosed that it had received a copy of the letter and conducted a hearing before requiring him to wear a stun belt, (2) abused its discretion by allowing Hymon to represent himself after performing an inadequate Faretta canvass, and (3) erred by sentencing Hymon as a habitual criminal when <b>the</b> judgments of <b>conviction</b> were not admitted into evidence. The Nevada Supreme Court held that while the district court should have disclosed its receipt of the letter and held a hearing {{on the use of the}} stun belt, such error was harmless as there existed an essential state interest in compelling Hymon to wear a stun belt. The court also held that the district court’s Faretta canvass was sufficient; that Hymon was competent to waive his right to counsel, and that such waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Finally, the court held that it was not error to sentence Hymon as a habitual criminal because it was clear that <b>the</b> prior <b>convictions</b> were introduced as evidence, argued by the parties, and considered by the court...|$|R

5000|$|On 12 December 2014, Monis' appeal {{against his}} {{conviction}} for criminal {{use of the}} postal service resulted in a split decision of the High Court. The decision related to his protest against the presence of Australian troops in Afghanistan, which he expressed by sending letters {{to the families of}} soldiers killed there in which he called the soldiers murderers and urged the families to petition the government to remove its troops from Afghanistan. One of the letters compared a dead soldier to a pig and called his body [...] "contaminated". He sent similar letters to the families of British soldiers and the mother of a government official killed by a bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia. Monis pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation and 300 hours of community service and banned from using the Australian postal service. According to The Age, this conviction consumed him for several years, and the hostage incident followed three days after an unsuccessful attempt <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> overturned.

5000|$|The Criminal Law (Historical Homosexual Convictions Expungement) Bill 2017 to {{implement}} the expungement scheme {{was introduced to the}} Queensland Parliament on 11 May 2017. The bill allows a person convicted of, or charged with, an eligible offence to apply to the director-general of the Justice and Attorney-General Department for expungement of the conviction or charge. In order to be eligible for expungement, the individual must have been charged with an offence involving participants aged at least 18 years. In a departure from the QLRC's recommendations, the legislation includes a provison allowing those charged with [...] "public morality offences" [...] to apply <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> expunged. The introduction of the law was accompanied by an official apology from Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on behalf of the Queensland Parliament to people charged under historical anti-homosexuality laws. The apology motion passed without objection, though LNP Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls did not speak to the motion. The bill was referred to the Legal Affairs and Community Safety Committee, which tabled its report to parliament on 14 July 2017. The committee recommended that the bill be passed, though LNP members objected to the inclusion of [...] "public morality" [...] offences in the legislation.|$|E
50|$|The lack {{of legal}} {{knowledge}} of magistrates should {{be offset by}} the fact that a legally qualified clerk is available. It is suggested that, in some courts, magistrates place too much reliance on the clerk, to the extent that a few cases have been quashed on appeal. For example, in R v Birmingham Magistrates ex parte Ahmed 1995, the defendant was accused of deception and handling. When the magistrates retired to consider their verdict, the clerk joined them. Since there was no point of law arising, this created a suspicion that he was taking part in deciding the verdict, and therefore the verdict was quashed. In the case of R v Eccles Justices, ex parte Farrelly (1992) the Queen's Bench Divisional Court quashed convictions because the clerk had apparently assisted and participated in the decision making process. In R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy (1924), a motorcyclist was involved in a road accident which resulted in his prosecution before a magistrates' court for dangerous driving. Unknown to the defendant and his solicitor, the clerk {{was a member of the}} firm of solicitors acting in a civil claim against the defendant arising out of the accident that had given rise to the prosecution. The clerk retired with the magistrates, who returned to convict the defendant. On learning of the clerk's provenance, the defendant applied <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> quashed. The magistrates swore affidavits stating that they had reached their decision to convict the defendant without consulting their clerk.|$|E
