40|$|Abiotic {{stresses}} {{are major}} environmental {{factors that affect}} agricultural productivity worldwide. NAC transcription factors play pivotal roles in abiotic stress signaling in plants. As a staple crop, wheat production is severely constrained by abiotic stresses whereas only a few NAC transcription factors have been characterized functionally. To promote the application of NAC genes in wheat improvement by biotechnology, a novel NAC gene designated TaNAC 67 was characterized in common wheat. To determine its role, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaNAC 67 -GFP controlled by the CaMV- 35 S promoter was generated and subjected to various abiotic stresses for morphological and physiological assays. Gene expression showed that TaNAC 67 was involved in response <b>to</b> <b>drought,</b> salt, cold and ABA treatments. Localization assays revealed that TaNAC 67 localized in the nucleus. Morphological analysis indicated the transgenics had enhanced <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> <b>drought,</b> salt and freezing stresses, simultaneously supported by enhanced expression of multiple abiotic stress responsive genes and improved physiological traits, including strengthened cell membrane stability, retention of higher chlorophyll contents and Na(+) efflux rates, improved photosynthetic potential, and enhanced water retention capability. Overexpression of TaNAC 67 resulted in pronounced enhanced <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> <b>drought,</b> salt and freezing stresses, therefore it has potential for utilization in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crops...|$|R

In this study, an osmotin from the resurrection plant Tripogon loliiformis (TlOsm) was characterized and functionally analyzed under abiotic stress conditions in T. loliiformis {{as well as in}} transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Oryza sativa (rice) plants. Real-time PCR analysis on mixed elicitor cDNA libraries from T. loliiformis showed that TlOsm was upregulated a thousand-fold during the early stages of osmotic stresses (cold, drought, and salinity) in both shoots and roots but down-regulated in shoots during heat stress. There was no change in TlOsm gene expression in roots of heat-stressed plants and during plant development. The plasma membrane localization of TlOsm was demonstrated in fluorescent-tagged TlOsm tobacco plants by confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis. Transgenic rice plants expressing TlOsm were assessed for enhanced <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> salinity, <b>drought</b> and cold stresses. Constitutively expressed TlOsm in transgenic rice plants showed increased <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> cold, <b>drought,</b> and salinity stresses when compared to the wild type and vector control counterparts.

30|$|Apart from {{improving}} characteristics {{suitable for}} food, feed, and bioenergy purposes, the agronomic performance of rice is of primary concern. <b>Tolerances</b> <b>to</b> <b>drought</b> and submergence {{are essential for}} rice production in south and southeast Asia because drought and flash flooding—a rapid and extreme flow of high water into a normally dry area, or rapid water-level rise in a stream above a predetermined flood level [30]—occur more frequently in these regions. A few QTLs against these stresses have been identified and are candidates for breeding [18]. Additionally, the development of rice plant protection against weeds, insects, and pathogens is needed, with built-in resistance to these biotic stresses highly advantageous. Transgenes conferring herbicide and insect resistance, such as lectin genes, Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin, avidin, and rice cysteine protease inhibitor, could be introduced into rice to facilitate crop damage prevention [31].|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{stresses}} such as drought, salinity, {{and cold}} are major factors that significantly limit agricultural productivity. NAC transcription factors play essential roles {{in response to}} various abiotic stresses. However, the paucity of wheat NAC members functionally characterized to date does not match {{the importance of this}} plant as a world staple crop. Here, the function of TaNAC 2 was characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. A fragment of TaNAC 2 was obtained from suppression subtractive cDNA libraries of wheat treated with polyethylene glycol, and its full-length cDNA was obtained by searching a full-length wheat cDNA library. Gene expression profiles indicated that TaNAC 2 was involved in response <b>to</b> <b>drought,</b> salt, cold, and abscisic acid treatment. To test its function, transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing TaNAC 2 –GFP controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter were generated. Overexpression of TaNAC 2 resulted in enhanced <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> <b>drought,</b> salt, and freezing stresses in Arabidopsis, which were simultaneously demonstrated by enhanced expression of abiotic stress-response genes and several physiological indices. Therefore, TaNAC 2 has potential for utilization in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerances in crops...|$|R

50|$|Other {{genes from}} various {{species have been}} {{inserted}} into the tomato {{with the hope of}} increasing their resistance to various environmental factors. A gene from rice (Osmyb4), which codes for a transcription factor, that was shown to increase cold and drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants, was inserted into the tomato. This resulted in increased drought tolerance, but did not appear to have any effect on cold tolerance. Overexpressing a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiport (AtNHX1) from A. thaliana lead to salt accumulating in the leaves of the plants, but not in the fruit and allowed them to grow more in salt solutions than wildtype plants.

5000|$|They are {{propagated}} by cuttings {{since they}} are established easily without rooting hormones. It is grown {{in a manner similar}} to its relatives such as the tomato, though it grows naturally upright by habit and can thus be cultivated as a free-standing bush, though it is sometimes pruned on trellises. Additionally, supports are sometimes used to keep the weight of the fruit from pulling the plant down. It has a fast growth rate and bears fruit within 4 to 6 months after planting. It is a perennial, but is usually cultivated as an annual. Seedlings are intolerant of weeds, but it can later easily compete with low growing weeds. Like their relatives tomatoes, eggplants, tomatillos and tamarillos, pepinos are extremely attractive to beetles, aphids, white flies and spider mites. Pepinos are tolerant of most soil types, but require constant moisture for good fruit production. Established bushes show some <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>drought</b> stress, but this typically affects yield. The plants are parthenocarpic, meaning it needs no pollination to set fruit, though pollination will encourage fruiting. The plant is grown primarily in Chile, New Zealand and Western Australia.

Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador also grow the plant, but on a more local scale. Outside of the Andean region, it been grown in various countries of Central America, Morocco, Spain, Israel, and the highlands of Kenya. In the United States several hundred hectares of the fruit are grown on a small scale in Hawaii and California.
