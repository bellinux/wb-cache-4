5000|$|The {{low water}} levels of 1908 {{inspired}} {{a proposal to}} preserve the Indian Head Rock by removing it from the river and displaying it in a popular riverfront park in Portsmouth. The proposal was by Henry A. Lorberg (1856-1943), a well-known Portsmouth historian and benefactor of the time. [...] "Henry Lorberg is going {{to communicate with the}} light house department with a view to having the snag boat Woodruff pull up the Indian rock, the idea of Mr. Lorberg being to have the city place the historic bowlder sic in York park, in a position overlooking the river, with an iron railing around it and a history of the rock, as far as obtainable, engraved or painted on the face. The wonder is the government hasn't pulled the rock out of its place long ago and crushed it with dynamite, as it is an undoubted menace to navigation of the river between five and fifteen feet. The bottom of many a boat and barge was torn out by it in the old days when steamboats were plentiful...Portsmouth is the River City and to preserve the rock in the manner referred to would be highly appropriate." [...] This story credited the carving of the face on the rock to a Portsmouth resident in the 1830s. [...] "The man or boy, who did the carving is reputed to have been John Book, an older half-brother of W. <b>T.</b> <b>Book,</b> of East Eighth street. Book was a very adventurous boy and grew {{to be one of the}} best known citizens of the county and state was a captain in the civil war and killed in battle. He carved the face some time in the thirties." [...] Clearly, Lorberg's proposal was not acted upon.|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosome}} band 6 p 21 high-mobility group gene, HMGI(Y), encodes DNA-binding proteins with both chromatin structural and gene regulatory roles. Although HMGI(Y) expression {{is associated with}} neoplastic transformation, no oncogenic HMGI(Y) mutations have been identified. We report pulmonary chondroid hamartoma chromosome 6 p 21 aberrations targeting HMGI(Y). Several pulmonary chondroid hamartomas had chromosome rearrangements mapping within 100 kb of HMGI(Y), and one pulmonary chondroid hamartoma contained an intragenic fusion juxtaposing HMGI(Y) A. <b>T</b> <b>book</b> DNA-binding domains with a laminin alpha 4 chain epidermal-growth-factor-like/ zinc-finger-like motif. These findings demonstrate an oncogenic role for HMGI(Y) and for laminin chain transcriptional regulatory motifs...|$|E
