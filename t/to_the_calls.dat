5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, {{and that it would}} be instructive to study how each taxon responds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of the other.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of their own species, particularly when exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 993, Manjutakin {{launched}} yet another expedition, capturing Apamea and Larissa (Ar. Shayzar) and continuing his raids in the Byzantine province around Antioch, before returning safely to Damascus. In spring 994, Manjutakin once more moved against Aleppo. Responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> for aid by the Hamdanids, Basil II ordered Bourtzes {{to come to their}} aid, and sent the magistors Leo Melissenos with reinforcements to Syria. The Byzantine army however was surprised and heavily defeated when attacked on two flanks by Manjutakin in a battle at the banks of the Orontes, on 15 September 994. Manjutakin went on to capture Azaz and continued his siege of Aleppo until the personal intervention of Basil II in a lightning campaign the next year. These failures, as well as accusations that he had exacerbated the conflict by imprisoning the Fatimid ambassador in 992, brought Basil's displeasure upon Bourtzes, who was replaced with Damian Dalassenos.|$|E

5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and mobbing, or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds (Cracticus torquatus). The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away {{the location of the}} vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. Superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp chits, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a purr while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.|$|E

25|$|Opponents of {{the bill}} cited recent polling that 70% of Canadians {{supported}} capital punishment and called on the government to call a national referendum on the issue. Other opponents accused Allmand and Trudeau of proposing the bill now {{so that it would}} not expire before the next federal election in 1979 and risk costing the Liberals votes. Almost all opponents though, thought that the death penalty was a useful tool to deter crime and terrorism. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker argued that after the Munich massacre, passing Bill C-84 was sending the wrong message in the lead-up to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> for referendum, including a motion for a national plebiscite by Alberta MP Gordon Towers, Allmand argued that the role of MPs was to deliberate in the House of Commons, make up their own minds, and then vote. He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues.|$|E

500|$|Adult Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{are usually}} found singly or in pairs. The {{breeding}} {{of this species}} has been little studied {{but it does not}} appear to be seasonal in nature. The female builds a mound nest out of vegetation and mud somewhere in a concealed location and lays a clutch of from 10 to 25 eggs, hiding them under further vegetation. The incubation period is around 90 days and the sex of the hatchlings depends on the temperature of the nest during that time. When the eggs begin to hatch, the female opens the nest in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> made by the young. Newly emerged juveniles have a coating of mucus and may delay entering the water for a few days until this has dried. Its continuing presence on their skin is believed to reduce algal growth. The female stays with the young for a few weeks after which time the hatchlings disperse. The young grow at the rate of about [...] per year and reach sexual maturity at around eight years.|$|E
