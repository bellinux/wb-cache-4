5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it. For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E

The season produced 24 tropical and subtropical cyclones, of which only 8 reached storm intensity, 4 became hurricanes, and only 1 reached major hurricane status. Although more active than the 1972 season, 1973 brought few storms of note. Nearly half of the season's storms affected land, one of which resulted in severe damage.|$|E

In their place, the game displays a still {{image of a}} statue holding its face in its hand, with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.|$|E
25|$|Credit {{scores are}} often used in {{determining}} prices for auto and homeowner's insurance. Starting in the 1990s, the national credit reporting agencies that generate credit scores have also been generating more specialized insurance scores, which insurance companies then use <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> insurance risk of potential customers.

25|$|There {{are various}} methods of calculating the engine {{displacement}} of a Wankel.

Unlike the overall feedback rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller. The listings of sellers with a rating of 4.3 or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower in search results. Power Sellers are required to have scores in each category above 4.5.|$|E
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
25|$|Grand Theft Auto IV {{has also}} {{prompted}} editing in the Australian (PAL) version, as Rockstar was worried it {{might get a}} RC rating. In the American release, sexual encounters with prostitutes occur inside the player's vehicle and the player {{has the ability to}} rotate the camera for a clearer view of what transpires. In the censored Australian version, the camera is fixed behind the vehicle, which rocks from side to side with accompanying audio effects. It is impossible for the player to view the inside of the car. Rockstar later decided <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> uncut version of the game which went on to receive a MA15+ and a patch was later released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 to uncensor the game.|$|E

25|$|Macroeconomic {{policy-making}} is {{a context}} requiring multi-objective optimization. Typically {{a central bank}} must choose a stance for monetary policy that balances competing objectives — low inflation, low unemployment, low balance of trade deficit, etc. To do this, the central bank uses {{a model of the}} economy that quantitatively describes the various causal linkages in the economy; it simulates the model repeatedly under various possible stances of monetary policy, in order to obtain a menu of possible predicted outcomes for the various variables of interest. Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.|$|E
25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> safety and robustness of meters.|$|E

25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not asked <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive {{than those who did not}} receive repeated exposure.|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. The participants were asked <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely}} to perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
