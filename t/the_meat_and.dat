5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E

5|$|Hindu {{philosopher and}} saint Adi Shankara (c. 8th century) is {{believed}} to have established Govardhana matha in Puri, with Vimala as its presiding goddess. According to Starza (author of The Jagannatha Temple at Puri), the Jagannath Temple was once a centre of worship for the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, along with their consorts and the three central forms of the Hindu Goddess, Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati (in the form of Vimala). The Shri Vidya sect devoted to Goddess worship was strong here until the 17th century. Slowly, Shri Vidya and Shiva-centric Shaiva traditions were eroded but remnants continue, with the Vishnu-centric Vaishnavism becoming the sole tradition. The Tantric Panchamakara, which includes fish, meat, liquor, parched grain and ritual intercourse, were replaced with vegetarian offerings and dance of devdasis. Fish was caught locally and offered to the goddess. King Narasimhadeva, who ruled between 1623â€“47, ended <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> fish offerings of the goddess, although the tradition was later partly revitalized. Today, the goddess is offered meat and fish on special days.|$|E
5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E
5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by {{how difficult it is to}} handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray is not aggressive, but its sting is {{sheathed in}} toxic mucus and {{is capable of}} piercing bone. Across its range, this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines, {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnets and fish traps. It is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch; a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud, becoming almost impossible to lift, or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> the cartilage are used; large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale. Adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless. In the Mae Klong and Bang Pakong Rivers, the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums. These trends pose conservation concerns; the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown, the latter because this species does not survive well in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{came close}} to going bankrupt, Blumenthal sold his house, his car {{and many of his}} possessions {{in order to keep the}} restaurant afloat. After four years, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list. Blumenthal worked with Professor Peter Barham of the University of Bristol, and developed a menu of dishes through experimentation such as slow-cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> causing them to seize. By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their discolouration, and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness. In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star, and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association.|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is taken}} by {{fisheries}} operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains {{a much higher}} concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far unregulated, fishing pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark's capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones have been reduced by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable to fishing zones due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.68.3% per year without additional conservation measures.|$|E

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mÃ©lange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> <b>and</b> serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, MÃ¼tzig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
