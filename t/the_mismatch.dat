5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend <b>the</b> <b>mismatch,</b> and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

However, using a word-learning task, recent research demonstrated that an initial negative effect of mismatching pictures on learning no longer occurred once learners gained task experience. It is unclear, however, whether learners consciously suppressed {{attention to the}} content of <b>the</b> <b>mismatching</b> pictures. Therefore, we examined the effects of a picture location change {{towards the end of the}} learning phase: for half of the participants, the picture location was changed after they gained task experience. If participants only ignore <b>the</b> location of <b>mismatching</b> pictures, word learning in <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> condition should be hampered after the location change. Changing the location of <b>the</b> <b>mismatching</b> pictures did not affect recall in <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> condition, but, surprisingly, the location change did hamper learning in the matched condition. In sum, it seems that participants learned to ignore the content, and not just the location of the irrelevant information...|$|R
25|$|Fault bend folds {{are caused}} by {{displacement}} along a non-planar fault. In non-vertical faults, the hanging-wall deforms to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>mismatch</b> across the fault as displacement progresses. Fault bend folds occur in both extensional and thrust faulting. In extension, listric faults form rollover anticlines in their hanging walls. In thrusting, ramp anticlines are formed whenever a thrust fault cuts up section from one detachment level to another. Displacement over this higher-angle ramp generates the folding.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} near-integer-ratio {{relationships}} between the orbital frequencies of the planets or major moons are sometimes pointed out (see list below). However, these have no dynamical significance {{because there is no}} appropriate precession of perihelion or other libration to make the resonance perfect (see the detailed discussion in the section above). Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if <b>the</b> <b>mismatch</b> is quite small because (unlike a true resonance), after each cycle the relative position of the bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically short timescales, their relative position is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. <b>The</b> <b>mismatch</b> after 8 years is only 1.5° of Venus' orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. Therefore, on timescales of thousands of years or more (still tiny by astronomical standards), their relative position is effectively random.|$|E

25|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>mismatch</b> repair (MMR) {{machinery}} offers inherent {{protection to}} the cell against nucleotide base mismatch. Therefore, any mutations introduced in the oligonucleotides can be targeted by the MMR. There {{are several ways to}} avoid this. First, the use of an E. coli strain that is MMR deficient will eradicate this issue. However, this also results in a higher rate of other random mutations throughout the genome. Another method to reduce mismatch repair is to bury the mutations of interest within other silent mutations. Since silent mutations do not often cause catastrophic effects, they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery. The presence of modified bases will also help to evade the MMR machinery because they are not recognized. Finally, long segments of mutations will be less affected by short segments of mutations.|$|E

If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another.

The American Embassy backers of the operation recommended that the guerrillas plan a step by step withdrawal back across the Plain of Jars, retreating through a series of four static lines. Key to the original defensive line was Phou Nok Kok. The PAVN attacked Phou Nok Kok's 600 man garrison throughout December, suffering an estimated 400 killed in action and 1,000 wounded, mostly inflicted by close air support. As bad flying weather curtailed air support for the Royalists during January 1971, the communists continued their attacks. On 12 January 1971, after a six-week defense that cost the PAVN about 600 killed, and despite the initial use of RLAF AC-47 gunships for support, the Hmong guerrillas withdrew from the stronghold. They had suffered 12 killed. With the loss of Phou Nok Kok, which barred the eastern entry to the Plain, the Royalists were forced to withdraw.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge in}} detection {{theory is that}} the size of the state space may be very large. In the context of universal hypothesis testing, two important problems pertaining to the large state space that have not been addressed before are: (1) What is the impact of a large state space on the performance of tests? (2) How does one design an effective test when the state space is large? This thesis addresses these two problems by developing a generalization of Kullback-Leibler (KL) mismatched divergence, called mismatched divergence. 1. We describe a drawback of the Hoeffding test: The asymptotic bias and variance of the Hoeffding test are approximately proportional {{to the size of the}} state space; thus, it performs poorly when the number of test samples is comparable to the size of state space. 2. We develop a generalization of the Hoeffding test based on <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> divergence, called <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> universal test. We show that this test has asymptotic bias and variance proportional to the dimension of the function class used to define <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> divergence. <b>The</b> dimension of the function class can be chosen to be much smaller than the size of the state space, and thus our proposed test has a better finite-sample performance in terms of bias and variance. 3. We demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> universal test also has an advantage when the distribution of the null hypothesis is learned from data. 4. We develop some algebraic properties and geometric interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>mismatched</b> divergence. We also show its connection to a robust test. 5.

25|$|Methylation of {{cytosine}} to form 5-methylcytosine {{occurs at}} the same 5 position on the pyrimidine ring where the DNA base thymine's methyl group is located, distinguishing thymine from the analogous RNA base uracil which has no methyl group. Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G mismatch. Repair mechanisms may then correct {{it back to the}} original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute G for A, turning the original C:G pair into an A:T pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation. This misincorporated base will not be corrected during DNA replication as thymine is a DNA base. If <b>the</b> <b>mismatch</b> is not repaired and the cell enters the cell cycle the strand carrying the T will be complemented by an A in one of the daughter cells, such that the mutation becomes permanent. The near-universal replacement of uracil by thymine in DNA, but not RNA, may have evolved as an error-control mechanism, to facilitate removal of uracils generated by the spontaneous deamination of cytosine.|$|E
25|$|The Army of Flanders {{had become}} {{particularly}} {{well known for}} its frequent mutinies, especially during the 1570s. These mutinies, or alteraciones, stemmed from <b>the</b> <b>mismatch</b> between Spain's strategic military ambitions and her fiscal means. Spain was the only European power {{to be able to}} project military force on the scale and distance of the Army of Flanders; backed by gold and especially silver from her American colonies, Spain had huge funds available. In practice, however, the costs of such a large military force outstripped even Spain's ability to pay for it. In 1568, the defence costs for the army in Flanders amounted to 1,873,000 florins a year. By 1574, the enlarged army was costing 1,200,000 florins a month. Even with increased taxation, the Low Countries could not hope to support such a force, but funds from Castile were limited – only 300,000 florins arrived each month at the time from Spain. This underlying fiscal tension was only just manageable in normal years; in years like 1575, when King Phillip II was forced to default on his loans yet again, there was simply no money available to pay the Army of Flanders. Mutinies usually ensued – ultimately the Army of Flanders mutinied 45 times between 1572 and 1609, with the mutinies coming to have a formal character and process of their own.|$|E
