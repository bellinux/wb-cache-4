Four instruments will be launched in a Black Brant 4 rocket employing different combinations of detector windows and gas. The detector is constructed with two layers of twelve cells. A columnator is mounted {{on the face of}} one layer whose cells are wired together alternately to form two main detector sections.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new architecture for time-to-digital conversion enabling a time resolution of 17 ps over {{a range of}} 50 ns with a conversion rate of 20 MS/s. The proposed architecture, implemented in a 65 nm FPGA system, consists of a pipelined interpolating time-to-digital converter (TDC). The TDC comprises a coarse <b>time</b> <b>discriminator</b> and a fine delay line, capable of sustained operation at a clock frequency of 300 MHz. A Turbo version of the circuit implements a pipelined interpolating TDC with suppressed dead time to reach a conversion rate of 300 MS/s {{at the expense of}} a systematic asymmetry that requires fast error correction. The TDCs proposed in this paper can be compensated for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations using a conventional charge pump based feedback or a digital calibration technique.

40|$|Nonequilibrium superconducting {{detectors}} {{exploit the}} early stages of the energy down cascade which occur after the absorption of radiation. They operate on a short temporal scale ranging from few microseconds down to tens of picoseconds. In such a way they provide fast counting capability, high time discrimination and also, for some devices, energy sensitivity. Nonequilibrium superconducting detectors are developed for their use both in basic science and in practical applications for detection of single photons or single ionized macromolecules. In this paper we consider two devices: distributed readout imaging detectors (DROIDs) based on superconducting tunnel junctions (STJs), which are typically used for high-speed energy spectroscopy applications, and hot-electron superconductive detectors (HESDs), which are typically used as fast counters and <b>time</b> <b>discriminators.</b> Implementation of the DROID geometry to use a single superconductor is discussed.

40|$|Position-resolution {{capabilities}} of the NASA laser ranging system are essentially determined by time-resolution {{capabilities of}} its optical timing receiver. The optical timing receiver consists of a fast photoelectric device, primarily a standard of microchannel-plate-type photomultiplier or an avalanche photodiode detector, a timing discriminator, a high-precision time-interval digitizer, and a signal-processing system. The time-resolution {{capabilities of the}} receiver {{are determined by the}} photoelectron time spread of the photoelectric device, the time walk and resolution characteristics of the timing discriminator, and the time-interval digitizer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a universal GNSS receiver channel {{capable of tracking}} any civil GNSS signal. This fundamentally differs from dedicated channels, each customized for a given signal. A mobile device could integrate fewer universal channels to harvest all available signals. This would allow securing signal availability, while minimizing power consumption and chip size, thus maximizing battery lifetime. In fact, the universal channel allows sequential acquisition and tracking of any chipping rate, carrier frequency, FDMA channel, modulation, or constellation, and is totally configurable (any integration <b>time,</b> any <b>discriminator,</b> etc.). It can switch from one signal to another in 1. 07 ms, {{making it possible for}} the receiver to rapidly adapt to its sensed environment. All this would consume 3. 5 mW/channel in an ASIC implementation, i. e., with a slight overhead compared to the original GPS L 1 C/A dedicated channel from which it was derived. After extensive surveys on GNSS signals and tracking channels, this paper details the implementation strategies that led to the proposed universal channel architecture. Validation is achieved using GNSS signals issued from different constellations, frequency bands, modulations and spreading code schemes. A discussion on acquisition approaches and conclusive remarks follow, which open up a new signal selection challenge, rather than satellite selection...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} discrimination as a generalization of both sorting and partitioning and show that worst-case linear-time discrimination functions (discriminators) can be defined generically, by (co-) induction on an expressive language of order denotations. The generic definition yields discriminators that generalize both distributive sorting and multiset discrimination. The generic discriminator can be coded compactly using list comprehensions, with order denotations specified using Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs). A GADT-free combinator formulation of discriminators is also given. We give some examples of the uses of discriminators, including a new most-significant-digit lexicographic sorting algorithm. Discriminators generalize binary comparison functions: They operate on n arguments at a time, but do not expose more information than the underlying equivalence, respectively ordering relation on the arguments. We argue that primitive types with equality (such as references in ML) and ordered types (such as the machine integer type), should expose their equality, respectively standard ordering relation, as discriminators: Having only a binary equality test on a type requires Θ(n 2) time to find all the occurrences of an element in a list of length n, for each element in the list, even if the equality test takes only constant <b>time.</b> A <b>discriminator</b> accomplishes this in linear time. Likewise, having only a (constant-time) comparison function requires Θ(n log n) time to sort a list of n elements. A discriminator can do this in linear time...|$|R
40|$|A {{front end}} ASIC (BiCMOS-SiGe 0. 35) has been {{developed}} {{within the framework of}} the MIMAC detector project, which aims at directional detection of non-baryonic Dark Matter. This search strategy requires 3 D reconstruction of low energy (a few keV) tracks with a gaseous. The development of this front end ASIC is a key point of the project, allowing the 3 D track reconstruction. Each ASIC monitors 16 strips of pixels with charge preamplifiers and their time over threshold is provided in real <b>time</b> by current <b>discriminators</b> via two serializing LVDS links working at 320 MHz. The charge is summed over the 16 strips and provided via a shaper. These specifications have been chosen in order to build an auto triggered electronics.

40|$|Multiset {{discrimination}} {{is a fundamental}} technique for finding duplicates in linear time without hashing or comparison-based sorting. It {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of equality (or equivalence) testing from two arguments to an arbitrary number of arguments since it decides all the pairwise equalities between its inputs in one go by grouping them into equivalence classes. In this paper we provide a general framework for multiset discrimination suitable for packaging multiset discriminators as a reusable software component. It shows how multiset discriminators can be defined polytypically; that is, inductively on the type structure of the input data. The polytypic discriminators are optimal for data structures without sharing. We show how linear <b>time</b> multiset <b>discriminators</b> can be defined for shared, acyclic data. Finally, we point out that three seemingly different algorithms on partition refinement for circular solve certain instances of multiset discrimination for We conclude by pulling them together into a single algorithm This allows extending multiset discrimination to abstract data types and type constructors and suggests that multiset discrimination should be built as base functionality into types, generalizing equality. The algorithmic ingredients behind multiset discrimination have been published before, though under disparate names and for special instances of multiset discrimination. Our contribution lies in demonstrating that can be combined for multiset discrimination in basically arbitrary cyclic data structures in time O(m log n) for data structures with m edges and n nodes. We provide general considerations for applying multiset discrimination vis a vis hashing and (comparison-based) sorting and give some empirical evidence of its practical efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Medical X-ray imaging is an {{important}} tool in diagnostic radiology. The ionising-radiation dose to the patient is justified by the clinical benefit of the examination. Nonetheless, detectors that operate at even lower doses and provide more information to the radiologist are desired. A hybrid pixel detector {{has the potential to}} provide a leap in detector technology as it incorporates a more advanced signal-processing capability than currently used detectors. The DIXI digital detector is a hybrid pixel detector developed for X-ray imaging. It consists of a readout chip and a semiconductor sensor. The division in two parts makes it possible to optimise each part individually. The detector is divided into square pixels with a size of 270 x 270 μm 2. DIXI has the ability to count single photons and every readout pixel has two embedded counters to allow the acquisition of two images close in <b>time.</b> A <b>discriminator</b> enables the selection of photons with energies above a preset threshold level. The readout chip Angie has been developed and its performance has been evaluated in terms of noise, threshold variation and capability to perform energy weighted counting. Silicon sensors have been fabricated, and a control system for DIXI has been designed and built. An electroless process for deposition of Ni/Au bumps on the chip and sensor has been optimised as a preparation for the assembly of a complete detector, which is being assembled by flip-chip bonding using anisotropic conductive film. A simulation library for the DIXI detector has been set up and results on the image quality are reported for different exposures and working conditions. A theoretical model for hybrid pixel detectors based on the cascaded linear system theory has been developed. The model can be used to investigate and optimise the detector for different detector configurations and operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our current study is to employ linear {{discriminant}} analysis (LDA; Philiastides & Sajda, 2006) to characterize the changes in ERPs over the entire course of a perceptual learning task. Configural learning is the perceptual learning process by which participants develop configural processing strategies or representations characterized by extremely efficient parallel information processing (Blaha & Townsend, Under Revision). Participants performed a perceptual unitization task in which they learned to categorize novel images. Correct categorization responses required exhaustive feature identification, which encouraged unitization of images into unified object percepts. Linear discriminator accuracy, measured by Az, increased each day of training, showing significant differences in neural signals between categories on and after training day 3 or 4 for all participants. Additionally, the LDA training window starting <b>time</b> resulting in <b>discriminator</b> performance of 65 % accuracy or better shifted from 450 – 500 ms to 300 ms after stimulus onset {{at the completion of}} training. LDA results are consistent with our earlier report (Blaha & Busey, 2007) of peak ERP amplitude differences between categories after training at approximately 170 ms and 250 ms after stimulus onset. Our EEG results are consistent with the hypothesis that perceptual unitization results in configural perceptual processing mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Single photon {{avalanche}} diode (SPAD) arrays have proven themselves as serious candidates for {{time of flight}} positron emission tomography (PET). Discrete readout schemes mitigate the low-noise requirements of analog schemes and offer very fine control over threshold levels and timing pickup strategies. A high optical fill factor is paramount to timing performance in such detectors, and consequently space is limited for closely integrated electronics. Nonetheless, a production, daily used PET scanner must minimize bandwidth usage, data volume, data analysis time and power consumption and therefore requires a real-time readout and data processing architecture {{as close to the}} detector as possible. We propose a fully digital, embedded real-time readout architecture for SPAD-based detector. The readout circuit is located directly under the SPAD array instead of within or beside it to remove the fill factor versus circuit capabilities tradeoff. The overall real-time engine reduces transmitted data by a factor of 8 in standard operational mode. Combined with small local memory buffers, this significantly reduces overall acquisition dead time. A prototype device featuring individual readout for 6 scintillator channels was fabricated. Timing readout is provided by a first photon discriminator and a 31 ps <b>time</b> to digital <b>discriminator,</b> while energy reading and event packaging is done using standard logic in real-time. The dedicated serial output line supports a sustained rate of 170 k counts per second (CPS) in waveform mode, while the standard operational mode supports 2. 2 MCPS.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} discrimination as a generalization of both sorting and partitioning and show that discriminators (discrimination functions) can be defined generically, by structural recursion on order and equivalence expressions denoting a rich class of total preorders and equivalence relations, respectively. Discriminators improve the asymptotic performance of generic comparison-based sorting and partitioning, yet do not expose more information than the underlying ordering relation, respectively equivalence. For a large class of order and equivalence expressions, including all standard orders for first-order recursive types, the discriminators execute in worst-case linear <b>time.</b> The generic <b>discriminators</b> can be coded compactly using list comprehensions, with order expressions specified using Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs). We give some examples of the uses of discriminators, including a new most-significant-digit lexicographic sorting algorithm and type isomorphism with an associative-commutative operator. Full source code of discriminators and their applications is included. 1 We argue discriminators should be basic operations for primitive and abstract types with equality. The basic multiset discriminator for references, originally due to Paige et al., is shown to be both efficient and fully abstract: it finds all duplicates of all references occurring in a list in linear time without leaking information about their representation. In particular, it behaves deterministically {{in the presence of}} garbage collection and nondeterministic heap allocation even when references are represented as raw machine addresses. In contrast, having only a binary equality test as in ML requires Θ(n 2) time, and allowing hashing for performance reasons as in Java, makes execution nondeterministic and complicates garbage collection...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{postural}} stability (DPS) is {{the ability}} to regain postural control after landing, 1 and is important for success at the elite level of ski and snowboard competitions. Numerous studies have identified different landing protocols for the assessment of DPS. The purpose of this series of investigations was to determine the effectiveness of using a vertical landing protocol versus a horizontal landing protocol to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) and time to stabilisation (TTS) as a measure of DPS within the elite athlete environment. In the first investigation, ten healthy recreational athletes and seven elite ski and snowboard athletes volunteered to participate. Athletes completed single leg right (SLR), single leg left (SLL) and double leg (DL) landings from a 0. 40 m vertical drop. Both athlete groups observed similar within-subject variation with a coefficient of variation (CV%) ranging from 9. 1 % to 28. 2 % for all landings. Test re-test reliability scores indicated good reliability for all outcome measures between day 1 and day 2 of testing for all measured outcomes: vertical TTS (TTSV), force peak (Fpeak), time to force peak (TFpeak), rate of force development (RFD) and impulse. A significant difference was observed between elite skiers and recreational athletes in single leg (SL: combined SLR and SLL) and DL landing tasks with effect sizes of, SL: d = 2. 63, DL: d = 0. 07 and SL: d = 0. 02, DL: d = 0. 07, for TFpeak and RFD, respectively. It was found that TTS measures did not have the sensitivity to discriminate between healthy non-injured recreational athletes and elite ski and snowboard athletes, with no significant differences being observed. Furthermore, it was observed that minimal discrepancies were seen between left and right leg landings and it is proposed that if no pre-injury DPS measures are taken, that the non-injured limb be used as a benchmark measure of DPS. The second study investigated whether a strength and power focused training program could improve TTS measures in elite ski athletes. Using the same vertical drop-landing protocol as the first study, seven elite mogul and ski-cross athletes participated in a six-week strength and power focused training program. Pre- and post-training TTS measures in the vertical, medial/lateral and anterior/posterior directions were determined to assess DPS. It was found that a six-week strength and power training intervention had no effect (d≤ 0. 42) on TTS scores in the three measured planes for elite mogul and ski-cross athletes. Changes in post-training intervention GRF measures for the SLL and SLR landings ranged from – 2. 0 % to 9. 0 % and DL landings from 0. 2 % to 2. 0 %. However, this does not preclude the relevance of the testing measures and it is suggested that these measures be used as a post-injury rehabilitation progress assessment tool for return to training and competition. In the third study, a multidirectional landing protocol was used to investigate the relationship between vertical and horizontal landing protocols. Ten elite ski and snowboard athletes participated in the study. It was hypothesised that a multidirectional landing protocol would be better at identifying DPS demands in the anterior/posterior and medial/lateral directions compared to only using a vertical drop-landing protocol. The multidirectional landing protocol involved a 0. 40 m vertical drop, a 100 % leg length forward step, a 50 % leg length lateral hop and a 50 % leg length medial hop landing task. The GRF measure of vertical peak force and TTS measures in all three planes were recorded. A Spearman’s Rank Order correlation was used to assess the athletes’ performance in a vertical drop landing compared to horizontal landing task. Results indicated no systematic relationship between landing directions, suggesting consideration be given to the landing protocol used and the specific GRF and DPS outcome measures being tested. Using the longest stabilisation <b>times</b> as a <b>discriminator</b> for placing the highest demand on DPS, it is recommended that a lateral hop protocol be used for assessment of TTS in the medial/lateral direction, a forward step protocol for TTS in the anterior/posterior direction and using a vertical drop or forward step protocol for TTS measures in the vertical direction and force peak (Fpeak) ...|$|R
