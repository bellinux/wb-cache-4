[...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E

5000|$|This is a play - an {{academic}} satire that winds {{in and out}} through the corridors of an institution of higher learning, uses the comic lens <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the flaws in the academia. What happens, for instance, behind the scenes in a major university? Who are the power brokers? What are the politics that operate {{in the system and}} at what different levels? How are appointments and promotions made? Is there any fair-play or justice? These are some of the questions raised in this play. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problems highlighted here are found on almost all campuses, in India and abroad. [...] The aim is not to target all academics, universities and colleges as corrupt but to take a peek at their not-so-pleasant side which, with a little effort and commitment, may be cured if we have the will to do so.

5000|$|Weiland was the band's primary lyricist. His style {{changed with}} the band's evolution; much of the lyrics on Core were written about {{societal}} issues such as religion, abuse of power, and isolation. The band's breakthrough single [...] "Sex Type Thing" [...] polarized critics with its lyrics, some interpreting it as advocacy of date rape. Weiland intended it as a feminist anthem, with its lyrics written in mockery of the narrator. As Weiland began to deal with substance abuse, his lyrics became more personal and intricate; songs like [...] "Interstate Love Song" [...] deal with his addiction's tolls on {{his relationship with his}} then-wife, Janina. The lyrics of the band's fourth album were written to provide closure to his marriage and addiction to heroin. Following the band's reunion in 2008, Weiland once again evolved as a songwriter, explaining: [...] "In the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling and I try to tell stories.
