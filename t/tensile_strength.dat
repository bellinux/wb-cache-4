5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because of its high <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and low cost, {{it is a major}} {{component}} used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|E
50|$|Concrete and {{ceramics}} {{typically have}} much higher compressive <b>strengths</b> than <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths.</b> Composite materials, such as glass fiber epoxy matrix composite, {{tend to have}} higher <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> than compressive strengths. Metals tend to have <b>tensile</b> and compressive <b>strengths</b> that are very similar.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{effects of}} B or Al impurities on structure and <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of CuZr by using first-principles density functional calculations. The calculations indicate that B or Al atoms doped on Zr atoms are energies favorable structure. We present stress–strain relationships for Cu–Zr–X (X = B, Al) systems along chosen directions. Both B and lower concentrations of Al decrease the <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths,</b> although there exists stronger covalent bonds between X and nearest neighbor Cu/Zr of Cu–Zr–X {{than that of}} CuZr, and plasticity in these systems can be triggered by electronic instabilities under tension. CuZr 0. 5 Al 0. 5 possesses larger <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> than CuZr, and we analyze mechanism of different <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for different concentrations of impurities by Mulliken overlap populations. All calculations show {{that the effects of}} B or Al impurities on <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of CuZr are quite composition-dependent...|$|R

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{industrial use}} of vanadium {{was in the}} steel alloy chassis of the Ford Model T, inspired by French race cars. Vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> (ca. 1905).|$|E
5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Some general {{physical}} and chemical properties of light and heavy metals are summarised in the table. The comparison should be treated with caution since the terms light metal and heavy metal are not always consistently defined. Also the physical properties of hardness and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> can vary widely depending on purity, grain size and pre-treatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} sea mussels to {{maintain}} their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> 58 times, and toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than steel.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

40|$|The maximum coarse {{aggregate}} size used in concrete can impact on its strength. An {{investigation of the}} effect of {{coarse aggregate}} size and replacement level of granite with palm kernel shell (PKS) on the compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of PKS concrete were investigated. Mix proportion by weight of 1 : 1 ½: 2 with w/c of 0. 50 were used. All samples were tested at 7 and up to 90 days. Results showed that both compressive and splitting <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> increased with increase in aggregate sizes. Both strengths however decreased with increase in replacement levels of granite with PKS. Optimum replacement level of granite with PKS was 25 % with compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of 22. 97 N/mm 2 and 1. 89 N/mm 2 respectively at maximum coarse aggregate size of 20 mm.

5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein {{very similar to that}} used in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air but as a result of being drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the multivariate linear {{models for the}} evaluation of compressive, flexural and splitting <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths,</b> and toughness ratio of high-performance steel fiber reinforced concrete (HPSFRC). In this study, 44 series of concrete mixes with varying silica fume replacement and fiber dosage (Vf = 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 %) were considered. Test results indicated that addition of fibers into silica fume concrete improves the compressive <b>strength</b> moderately and <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> significantly. Based on the test results of 144 specimens, multivariate linear regression models were developed for the prediction of 28 -day strength and toughness properties of HPSFRC and the absolute variations obtained are 1. 09 %, 2. 36 %, and 3. 36 % for compressive, flexural, and splitting <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths,</b> respectively. The validity of the proposed models was verified with the test data of earlier researchers. The proposed models were shown to provide results in good correlation with experimental results.

5|$|Nickel {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
