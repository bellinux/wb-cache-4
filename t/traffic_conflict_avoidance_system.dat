40|$|From the {{perspective}} of flight guidance, the development of segmented approach procedures that allow for rerouting around congested areas is a promising approach to tackle noise issues. However, these procedures currently do not allow capacity-beneficial independent runway operations. To support facilitating independent operations of segmented approaches at parallel runway systems, an elementary safety concept will be presented in this work. Therefore, a generic airport scenario with two parallel runways will be considered, for which a straight approach is proposed {{for one of the}} parallel runways, while a segmented approach path is assumed for a second runway. The concept of precision runway monitoring, established for straight and independent parallel approaches, will be modified to comply with the segmented approach geometry and a RNP-characteristic navigation performance. Based on the proposed approach design, required minimum runway spacings that meet a predefined level of safety will be identified. As the proposed approach geometry might foster the issuing of onboard collision alerts, the compatibility of the proposed procedure with the <b>traffic</b> alert and <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> (TCAS) will additionally be evaluated. Therefore, critical runway spacings will be determined to either issue traffic warnings or resolution advisories. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Automated Airspace concept uses {{ground-based}} {{computers and}} a ground-to-air data link to provide separation assurance and other selected air traffic services for properly equipped aircraft. The elimination of manual separation {{monitoring and control}} of equipped aircraft allows sector capacity, which is currently limited by controller workload, to be increased significantly. In this environment controllers can safely shift their attention to more strategic tasks such as optimization of traffic flow. Controllers will manually control unequipped aircraft operating in Automated Airspace sectors. An independent separation monitoring and <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> provides a safety net against failures of the primary ground based computer system as well as failures of certain on board systems and pilot errors. Techniques for <b>conflict</b> detection and <b>avoidance</b> designed to support this concept are described.

The first two experiments compared two-dimensional (coplanar) with three-dimensional (perspective) versions of a cockpit display of traffic information. In Experiment 1, 30 certified flight instructors flew a series of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> detection and <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers around an intruder aircraft, sometimes {{in the presence of a}} second intruder. The results revealed an advantage for the coplanar display, particularly when there was vertical intruder behavior. In Experiment 2, 17 instructors flew with the coplanar and perspective formats when weather information was either overlaid or displayed separately. Again performance was best with the coplanar display, particularly when the weather data were overlaid. The results of both {{experiments are}} also discussed in ten-ns of the traffic maneuver stereotypes exhibited by the pilots. Experiment 3 examined the benefits of the two different predictor elements used in the coplanar displays of Experiments 1 and 2. The study was carried out in a multitask context. These elements were both found to improve safety (reduce actual and predicted conflicts) and to reduce workload, although the different elements affected workload in different ways. Neither predictor element imposed a cost to concurrent task performance...|$|R

Using an extended communication competence-based theory of interpersonal conflict, it was hypothesised that <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> would fully mediate the link between alexithymia and relationship quality. Furthermore, facial affect recognition, perspective taking and locus of control were each hypothesised to partially mediate the relationship between alexithymia and <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance.</b> Several direct associations between variables within these mediational effects were also predicted. Participants (N = 207), undergraduate students and community members, completed an online survey which comprised standardised self-report measures and one objective task. Interrelationships among variables were assessed in path analysis. Overall, the hypothesised model adequately represented observed relationships between variables; however, hypotheses were generally not supported. <b>Conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> did not mediate the association between alexithymia and relationship quality, but a significant indirect effect of alexithymia on relationship quality by way of <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> was found. Facial affect recognition, perspective taking and locus of control did not contribute to the relationship between alexithymia and <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance.</b> Participants who were more accurate in recognising face emotions reported greater tendency to avoid conflict, which was an unexpected and interesting finding.

40|$|In test {{generation}} {{based on}} model-checking, white-box test criteria are represented as trap conditions {{written in a}} temporal logic. A model checker is used to refute trap conditions with counter-examples. From a feasible counterexample test inputs are then generated. Earlier research has demonstrated the usefulness of this approach and revealed its weakness. The major problems of applying this approach to engineering applications derive {{from the fact that}} engineering programs have an infinite state space and non-linear numerical computations. Our solution is to combine predicate abstraction (which reduces the state space) with a numerical decision procedure (which supports predicate abstraction by solving non-linear constraints) based on interval analysis. We have developed a prototype and applied it to MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage) test case generation. We have used the prototype on a number of C modules taken from a <b>conflict</b> detection and <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> and from a Boeing 737 autopilot simulator. The modules range from tens of lines up to thousands of lines in size. Our experience shows that although in theory the inclusion of a decision procedure for non-linear arithmetic may lead to non-terminating behavior and false positives (as abstraction-based model checking already does), our prototype is able to automatically produce feasible counterexamples with only a few exceptions. Furthermore, the process runs with acceptable execution times, without requiring any other knowledge of the specification, and without tampering with the original C programs...|$|R

40|$|In {{research}} on <b>Traffic</b> <b>Conflicts</b> Techniques, Time-To-Collision (TTC) {{has proven to}} be an effective measure for rating the severity of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> and for discriminating critical from normal behaviour. The results of several studies point to the direct use of TTC as a cue for decision-making in traffic. The current development of driver support systems based on the application of modern technologies makes it necessary to have detailed knowledge on how drivers operate, and at what level and when a system should warn the driver or take action. An important issue in developing Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> (CAS) is to define a proper warning strategy, that warns the driver only when the driver is really at danger and immediate action is required. Misses should be avoided, but too many false alarms may easily cause the system to become a nuisance to the driver.

The problem is to keep a given minimum safety distance for aircraft along their trajectories. In order to ensure safety within the air traffic, minimum distances between aircraft have to be respected. Aircraft are said in conflict if they are too close to each other. The associated problem is called aircraft <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance.</b> The actual norm of the separation between two aircraft is defined as follows: 1000 ft vertically and 5 NM horizontally (with the units: 1 NM (nautical mile) = 1, 852 m; 1 ft (feet) = 0. 3048 m). In this context, various approaches to the aircraft <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> problem have been provided. A survey is given by Kuchar and Yang in [9]. The problem of aircraft <b>conflict</b> <b>avoidance</b> is largely investigated in terms of aircraft trajectory deviations using altitude or heading changes.
