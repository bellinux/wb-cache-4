5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E
5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} readily available, it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> or tolerance to component variation. The {{difficulties of the}} image method were firmly put in the past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E

Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E

40|$|A Fokker-Planck {{description}} for globally coupled many-body {{systems with}} <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> {{was developed by}} integrating previously derived Fokker-Planck equations for many-body systems and for time-delayed systems. By means of the Fokker-Planck description developed, we examined the dependence of the variability of many-body systems on attractive coupling forces and <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> For a fundamental class of systems exemplified by a time-delayed Shimizu-Yamada model for muscular contractions, we established that the variability is an invertible one-to-one mapping of coupling forces and <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> and that coupling forces and <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> have opposite effects on system variability, allowing <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> to annihilate the impact of coupling forces. Furthermore, we showed how variability measures {{could be used to}} determine coupling parameters and <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> from experimental data. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Measurements with unknown <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> {{are common}} in {{different}} applications such as microphone array, radio antenna array calibration, where the sources (e. g. sounds) are transmitted in unknown time instants.

We propose a novel rank constraint on a matrix depending on the measurements and the unknown <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> are recovered by solving a truncated nuclear norm minimization problem using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

5|$|Further {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} include precision measurements of the Shapiro effect or gravitational <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> for light, most recently in 2002 by the Cassini space probe. One set of tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of gyroscopes travelling through space. One of these effects, geodetic precession, has been tested with the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the Moon). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called frame-dragging. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E
5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
50|$|Time DelaysThe {{movement}} {{of a system}} from one state to another depends on the <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> in systems are short time shifts of arbitrary duration. In view {{of the relation between}} a function (gene on or off) and its associated variable (gene product present or absent), the <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> become real entities whose values, far from being arbitrary, reflect specific physical processes (synthesis, degradation, dilution, etc.). The values of the different <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> {{play an important role in}} determining the pathway along which the system evolves.|$|R
30|$|<b>Time</b> <b>delays</b> are {{ubiquitous}} in biology [13], physics [14], chemistry [15], optics [16], and complex networks [17, 18]. Thus, <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> {{need to be}} considered in GRNs because of the finite speeds of the slow processes of transcription, translation, and translocation [7 – 10, 12]. Furthermore, inappropriate considerations of <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> can lead to incorrect predictions of the behavior of GRNs.|$|R
30|$|If the {{variance}} is zero, {{or if it}} is low compared to edge weights, network distances are a good proxy for <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> (see “Identification of the source class” section).

5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a <b>time</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational <b>time</b> <b>delay.</b> The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to stop short of another train.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — When {{designing}} the control loops for tokamaks, {{it is important}} to acknowledge the effects of <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> An assumption sometimes made for tokamaks having supercon-ducting coils is that these extra <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> will not have any undesirable effects on control. In fact, introducing extra delays into the axisymmetric control loops of certain superconducting tokamaks can have significant detrimental consequences. Aside from qualitative observations, the detrimental effects of extra <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> in tokamak control loops are not always well understood outside the control community. This study exposes and quantifies the detrimental effects imposed by <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> in the control loop in superconducting tokamaks, by focusing on plasma current control and radial position control in a vertically stable circular plasma in the KSTAR tokamak. Delays in the power supplies, data acquisition, and vessel structure are taken into account. Extremum-seeking-based optimal tuning of PID controllers is proposed as a possible method for remediating the negative effects of <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> The Nyquist dual locus technique is employed to assess stability of the optimally tuned closed-loop system in the presence of <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> I...|$|R
