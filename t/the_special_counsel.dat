5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. <b>The</b> <b>special</b> <b>counsel</b> report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
25|$|Inslaw's {{allegations}} against the Justice Department {{led to a}} number of investigations, including internal Department probes and Congressional investigations by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) and the House Judiciary Committee. The DOJ eventually appointed a special counsel to investigate. After <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>counsel</b> issued his report, Inslaw responded with a lengthy rebuttal. The DOJ then re-examined the special counsel's findings, resulting in the release of a final Department review.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after Comey's dismissal, the FBI {{reportedly}} widened its investigation to examine whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Many FBI insiders believed the real reason Comey was fired was because he had refused to end the investigation into Russian connections to the election. In his June testimony Comey said that Trump never asked him to stop the Russia investigation. The special counsel's office took over the investigation. ABC News later clarified that <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>counsel</b> is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation {{has not yet been}} launched.|$|E

500|$|Chotiner was {{involved}} in recruiting Republican candidates in the unsuccessful attempt to get a Republican Senate majority in the 1970 elections. Some of Chotiner's friends stated that Nixon involved him in this project after news reports claimed that Nixon had abandoned his former campaign manager, however, Chotiner himself denied that and stated he had been made special counsel because {{some people in the}} White House had decided he could be useful. <b>The</b> <b>special</b> <b>counsel</b> also coordinated Vice President Spiro Agnew's campaign against [...] "radic lib" [...] senatorial candidates, including New York Republican Senator Charles Goodell, who was subsequently defeated by Conservative Party candidate James L.

2500|$|In 2017 a {{group of}} eleven staff from the center, {{including}} its chief of medicine {{and the head of}} the center's spinal cord unit, took their concerns about sub-standard care and conditions at the facility to the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Counsel.</b> They also alerted journalists at the Boston Globe, which published a lengthy article on July 15, 2017, outlining the problems which had existed for several years despite the fact that the center had been upgraded to a four-star rating by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016. Within hours of publication of the Boston Globe article, David Shulkin, the Secretary for Veterans Affairs, announced the removal of two of the center's top administrators as part of what he called a [...] "top-to-bottom" [...] review of the facility's operations. The following month Shulkin announced the establishment of a special task force to review the overall provision of medical care for New Hampshire's veterans and pledged $30 million to upgrade the Manchester VA center. Fallout from the affair led New Hampshire's congressional delegation to renew their efforts in the US Congress to re-establish a full-service veterans hospital in the state.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Rove {{failed to}} tell the grand jury about his conversations with Cooper. According to Rove, he only remembered he had spoken to Cooper after {{discovering}} a July 11, 2003, White House e-mail that Rove had written to then-deputy National Security advisor Stephen J. Hadley in which Rove said he had spoken to Cooper about the Niger controversy. Luskin also testified before the grand jury. He told prosecutors that Time reporter Viveca Novak had told him prior to Rove's first grand jury appearance that she had heard from colleagues at Time that Rove {{was one of the}} sources for Cooper's story about Plame. Luskin in turn said that he told Rove about this, though Rove still did not disclose to the grand jury that he had ever spoken to Cooper about Plame. Viveca Novak testified she couldn't recall when she spoke to Luskin. Rove testified a total of five times before the federal grand jury investigating the leak. After Rove's last appearance, Luskin released a statement that read in part: [...] "In connection with this appearance, <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>counsel</b> has advised Mr. Rove that he is not a target of the investigation. Mr. Fitzgerald has affirmed that he has made no decision concerning charges." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzgerald's {{subsequent}} replies to reporters' questions shed further {{light on}} {{the parameters of the}} leak investigation and what, as its lead prosecutor, bound by the rules of grand jury secrecy, he could and could not reveal legally at the time. Official court documents released later, on April 5, 2006, reveal that Libby testified that [...] "he was specifically authorized in advance" [...] of his meeting with Judith Miller, reporter for The New York Times, to disclose the [...] "key judgments" [...] of the October 2002 classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE). [...] According to Libby's testimony, [...] "the Vice President later advised him that the President had authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE [...]" [...] According to his testimony, the information that Libby was authorized to disclose to Miller [...] "was intended to rebut the allegations of an administration critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson." [...] A couple of days after Libby's meeting with Miller, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told reporters, [...] "We don't want to try to get into kind of selective declassification" [...] of the NIE, adding, [...] "We're looking at what can be made available." [...] A [...] "sanitized version" [...] of the NIE in question was officially declassified on July 18, 2003, ten days after Libby's contact with Miller, and was presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. The NIE contains no references to Valerie Plame or her CIA status, but <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Counsel</b> has suggested that White House actions were part of [...] "a plan to discredit, punish or seek revenge against Mr. Wilson."
