Blake agreed to a much more conservative compensation package than Nardelli, that is very heavily dependent upon the success of the company. Although a longtime deputy to Nardelli at GE and Home Depot, Blake was said to lack Nardelli's hard edge and instead preferred to make decisions by consensus. Indeed, Blake repudiated many of his predecessor's strategies, and {{it has been reported that}} the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> not spoken since Nardelli departed Home Depot.|$|E

With Ben-Hur, the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> given most of the fortunes to the church of Antioch.

Fassbinder plays the lead role of Franz, a small-time pimp who is torn between his {{mistress}} Joanna, a prostitute played by Hanna Schygulla, and his friend Bruno, a gangster sent after Franz by the syndicate that he has refused to join.

It was broadcast on 30 March 2007 and repeated on 10 August 2007. Although Brock participated in its making he did not appear in the programme, it is alleged that he requested all footage of himself be removed after he was denied any artistic control over the documentary. In one of the documentary's opening narratives regarding Brock, it is stated that he {{declined to be interviewed for}} the programme because of Nik Turner's involvement, indicating that the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> still not been reconciled over the xhawkwind.com incident.|$|E

Years {{later in a}} 1988 interview, Kirk said that Cramer had not given him any assistance in either the 1964 or 1966 campaigns. He thought it was because Cramer wanted the gubernatorial nomination.

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with his express wishes, Newman {{was buried in}} the grave of his lifelong friend Ambrose St. John.

The <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> since found common ground and work together at the Bipartisan Policy Center and often speak together for healthcare conventions and events. After the 2004 elections, amid the controversy over Arlen Specter's post-election remarks, [...] Frist demanded a public statement from Specter to repudiate his earlier remarks and pledge support for Bush's judiciary nominees.
