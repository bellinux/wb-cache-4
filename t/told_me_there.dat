500|$|On February 27, 2007, {{at about}} 10am, {{a suicide bomber}} killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. The Taliban claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target. They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation. The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying [...] "I heard a loud boom... The Secret Service came in and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> had been an attack on the main gate." [...] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

2500|$|Still, the Coens {{open the}} film with a {{voice-over}} narration by Tommy Lee Jones (who plays Sheriff Ed Tom Bell) {{set against the}} barren Texas country landscape where he makes his home. His ruminations on a teenager he sent to the chair explain that, although the newspapers described the boy's murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend as a crime of passion, [...] "he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> weren't nothin' passionate about it. Said he'd been fixin' to kill someone {{for as long as}} he could remember. Said if I let him out of there, he'd kill somebody again. Said he was goin' to hell. Reckoned he'd be there in about 15 minutes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{used to be}} a real leftist. I {{remember}} Arik Sharon [...] coming here, to my house, a {{few months}} before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rivera earned {{straight}} A's {{in school}} until her sophomore year, when at 15 {{she became pregnant}} with the first of her five children, Janney [...] "Chiquis" [...] Marín-Rivera. She supported {{the two of them}} by selling CDs at flea markets, while working toward her GED at a continuation school and graduating as class valedictorian. Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, [...] "Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's what I had to do, but my counselors <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was no way they would let me drop out. I had too much promise." [...] She attended California State University, Long Beach, and obtained a college degree in business administration and worked in real estate before going to work for her father's record label.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa Goldstein portrays Millicent Huxtable, Brooke's {{assistant}} at her shop Clothes Over Bros. [...] "I was constantly auditioning for TV and film while performing in professional theatre", said Goldstein. [...] "My agent in Orlando called and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was an audition for One Tree Hill, {{and told me}} I could either audition for the receptionist or the quirky fashion assistant, 'Millicent.' I {{jumped at the chance}} to audition for the 'quirky assistant,' I thought it would be fun." [...] She added, [...] " [...] found someone to love her quirks and all, which made her perfectly OK with being exactly who she is." [...] Millicent is involved in a romantic relationship with Marvin [...] "Mouth" [...] McFadden. In the first episode of season 6, she moves to Omaha with him. She returns to Tree Hill during the fifth episode to work for Brooke in her new store. She reunites with Mouth only to endure a series of mishaps.|$|E
2500|$|Mudge missed {{much of the}} 2005 season, first recuperating from an {{operation}} to rehabilitate a damaged knee which left her on crutches, and then succumbing to a bout of plantar fasciitis between May and July. Of her surgery, Mudge said: [...] "I'd worn away all my knee cartilage – {{more to do with}} my running style than the sport itself. I was running on the bare bone of my femur, so the surgeon drilled a lot of holes, which stimulates scar tissue, and eventually, I could run again. My knee was more painful afterwards than before. I was prepared for that, but was allowed to run for only ten minutes even months after the operation. I deliberately did not ask about the success or failure rate in order to keep a positive frame of mind. It was only six months later that a physiotherapist <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> were lots of people for whom the operation did not work." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Greek {{historian}} Herodotus instead depicts Khufu as a heretic {{and cruel}} tyrant. In his literary work Historiae, Book II, chapter 124–126, he writes: [...] "As long as Rhámpsinîtos was king, as they <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> {{was nothing but}} orderly rule in Egypt, and the land prospered greatly. But after him Khéops became king over them and brought them to every kind of suffering: He closed all the temples; after this he kept the priests from sacrificing there and then he forced all the Egyptians to work for him. So some were ordered to draw stones from the stone quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and others he forced to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those called the Libyan mountains. And they worked by 100,000men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, {{and it is a}} work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid. For the length of it is 5furlongs and the breadth 10fathoms and the height, where it is highest, 8fathoms, and it is made of polished stone and with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, 10years were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel {{it was going to happen}} sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.|$|E
