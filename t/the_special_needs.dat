30|$|Although euphemisms are {{intended}} to put a more positive spin on the words they replace, some euphemisms are ineffective. Our study examined {{the effectiveness of a}} popular euphemism for persons with disabilities, <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Most style guides prescribe against using <b>the</b> euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and recommend instead using the non-euphemized term disability; disability advocates argue adamantly against <b>the</b> euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> which they find offensive. In contrast, many parents of children with disabilities prefer to use <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> rather than disability. But no empirical study has examined whether <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is more or less positive than the term it replaces. Therefore, we gathered a sample of adult participants from the general population (N[*]=[*] 530) and created a set of vignettes that allowed us to measure how positively children, college students, and middle-age adults are viewed when they are described as having <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> having a disability, having a certain disability (e.g., is blind, has Down syndrome), or with no label at all. We predicted and observed that persons are viewed more negatively when described as having <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> than when described as having a disability or having a certain disability, indicating that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is an ineffective euphemism. Even for members of the general population who have a personal connection to disability (e.g., as parents of children with disabilities), <b>the</b> euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is no more effective than the non-euphemized term disability. We also collected free associations to <b>the</b> terms <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and disability and found that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is associated with more negativity; <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> conjures up more associations with developmental disabilities (such as intellectual disability) whereas disability is associated with a more inclusive set of disabilities; and <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> evokes more unanswered questions. These findings recommend against using <b>the</b> euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} family {{guidelines}} and agreements, corporate policies exclusively refer to marriages among {{women and men}} and thereby disregard the situation and <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> of non-traditional families. These non-traditional families often consist of couples or individuals with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) backgrounds that are increasingly under pressure of the community, as their needs within corporations are often paid inadequate attention. Exclusive behavior such as creating environments that do not encourage LGBTs to disclose their sexual orientation, or even neglecting the fact that LGBT are allowed to adopt children, leads to a feeling of isolation and job stress that ultimately negatively effects the WLB of the affected individuals.|$|E
25|$|An Act of January 1984 {{asserted}} a {{right for}} all parents {{to benefit from}} a parental leave of absence for childrearing, providing that they have one year’s seniority.

In 1982, the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity.

25|$|All {{previous}} night fighter {{versions of the}} Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> of a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7.

40|$|A {{research}} article on <b>the</b> provision of <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> education in Zimbabwe. This paper {{is informed by}} the view that by accepting the principles enunciated in the Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education, Zimbabwe opted for inclusion as its guiding philosophy in <b>the</b> provision of <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education. In <b>the</b> light of this, the paper further presents <b>the</b> situation of <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education as it has historically developed in Zimbabwe, noting that it was, and largely informed by the philosophy of integration. The argument is then made that there is need for conceptual clarity if integration and inclusion {{are not to be}} confused in <b>the</b> provision of <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education so that the focus should be on inclusive education for which Zimbabwe has opted. In other words, it is noted that while inclusion is the preferred concept, it appears that integration predominates <b>the</b> practice in <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education in Zimbabwe. This predominance largely emanates from policy documents that have been produced over the years to give guidance to those involved in <b>the</b> provision of <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education. Even scholars who have written on <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> Education in Zimbabwe tend to betray a lack of conceptual clarity between these two concepts as they tend to use them interchangeably.

It is maintained in this article that lack of conceptual clarity often results in lack of progress towards the attainment of the preferred philosophy...|$|R
