5|$|With the {{discovery}} of karyotype techniques in the 1950s, it became possible to identify abnormalities of chromosomal number or shape. In 1959, Jérôme Lejeune reported {{the discovery}} <b>that</b> <b>Down</b> syndrome resulted from an extra chromosome. However, Lejeune's claim to the discovery has been disputed, and in 2014, the Scientific Council of the French Federation of Human Genetics unanimously awarded its Grand Prize to his colleague Marthe Gautier {{for her role in}} this discovery. The discovery was in the laboratory of Raymond Turpin at the Hôpital Trousseau in Paris, France. Jérôme Lejeune and Marthe Gautier were both his students.|$|E
5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned <b>that</b> <b>down.</b> The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. Nobody had its American premiere on 25 June 2011, at the Los Angeles Film Festival, nearly two years since its original debut. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown at the festival. The Consul General of Belgium, Geert Criel, held a second United States screening of Mr. Nobody on 21 December 2011, at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.|$|E
5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue <b>that</b> <b>Down</b> syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects <b>that</b> <b>Down</b> syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

25|$|Australian opener Jimmy Maher {{recorded}} his second successive single-figure score {{in his first}} match for Durham, as the hosts made it 59 for 3, but centuries from Paul Collingwood and Dale Benkenstein sent {{them back in the}} lead. The pair added 206 runs together before Collingwood was out for 112 - his sixth first-class century in twelve matches - while Benkenstein continued to 162 not out, adding 80 runs with Gareth Breese and 21 for the ninth wicket with Brad Williams before declaring. The declaration set Derbyshire 280 to win in 66 overs, and Michael di Venuto and Steve Stubbings put on 91 for the first wicket to cut <b>that</b> <b>down</b> to 189. They had used two hours to hit those 91, though, leaving two hours for the remaining 189 - and though Stubbings completed his century, the rest of the batting order could not quite hit quite quickly enough, and they finished on 277 for 6 - three runs short of victory.|$|E
25|$|The second {{method used}} was the linear-plus-cubic diffusion, {{which is a}} model of fault scarping. This method uses the {{diffusive}} process on hill slopes, such as rain-splash and wind erosion, that move sediment down hill. t = t’(SO)*2/k (0). The last method used to date the faulting was the morphologic dating without numerical model. Such a technique requires <b>that</b> <b>down</b> slope debris instability is a timedependent function of slope angle, in units of volume per time per length of contour (Nash, 2005). The scarp ages can be determined based on the relationship Ta/Tb = H*-2 b / H-2 b From the first method we can conclude that there were at least five seismic events that did not occur at the same time. From method two we can say than the faulting ages between 57ka to 377ka with surface offset of 11.2m that had a magnitude of 6-7 earthquakes. Finally the third method of dating concludes that the relative ages of the east Potrillo fault scarps ranges form 153,000 to 239,000.|$|E
25|$|The train shed {{was removed}} in 1912-13 and the {{platforms}} extended northwards towards the level crossing. A second island platform was provided {{on the west}} side and this entailed the goods sheds being narrowed from two tracks to one at their southern end. The middle island platform was mainly used for LSWR trains while down GWR services used the original main platform and the new island platforms. Before Southern Region services to Plymouth were abandoned, passengers could see Plymouth-bound services of the Western Region and Southern Region leaving St Davids in opposite directions. The station has remained largely in this form since, but resignalling in the 1985 saw the ex-LSWR services moved to the main platform so <b>that</b> <b>down</b> ex-GWR line services did not have to cross their path {{at the south end of}} the station. A through line between platforms 1 and 3 was removed at the same time. The new signal box was built on the site of the old atmospheric engine house and replaced three older signal boxes.|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-1840s Downing's {{reputation}} was impeccable and he was, in a way, a celebrity of his day. This afforded him {{a friendship with}} Luther Tucker— publisher and printer of Albany, New York - who hired Downing to edit a new journal. [...] "The Horticulturist", and [...] "Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste" [...] was first published under Downing's editorship {{in the summer of}} 1846; he remained editor of this journal until his death in 1852. The journal was his most frequent influence on society and operated under the premises of horticulture, pomology, botany, entomology, rural architecture, landscape gardening, and, unofficially, premises dedicated public welfare in various forms. It was in this journal <b>that</b> <b>Downing</b> first argued for a New York Park, which in time became Central Park.

500|$|This kind of {{literary}} patronage started while Jocelin was abbot of Melrose. Archie Duncan {{has shown that}} it was probably Jocelin who first commissioned {{the writing of the}} Chronicle of Melrose. Duncan argued that Jocelin commissioned the entries dealing with the period between 731 and 1170, putting the writing {{in the hands of a}} monk named Reinald (who later became Bishop of Ross). This chronicle is one of the few extant chronicles from [...] "Scotland" [...] in this period. G. W. S. Barrow, writing before Duncan advanced these arguments, noted <b>that</b> <b>down</b> to the end of King William's reign [...] "the chronicle of Melrose Abbey ... represents a strongly 'Anglo-Norman' as opposed to a native Scottish point of view". It is thus possible that this anti-Scottish world-view reflected that of Jocelin's, at least before he left the abbey.|$|E

It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage.
