5|$|After the Bar Kokhba revolt was crushed, Hadrian {{converted}} the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine {{dedicated to the}} Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.

5|$|In 1629, {{work was}} {{interrupted}} by flooding, over two metres in depth. Parts of the city were damaged, especially around the main plaza or Zocalo.

5|$|Wales. The first {{church on}} <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> built in 610. The present {{building}} on the site dates from 1873, and was designed by the rector at the time. It reuses earlier material including a decorated 15th-century doorway and a 17th-century bell.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> used as a chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built {{to serve as a}} chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work had been carried out by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E

5|$|Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue is {{the eastern}} {{terminal}} {{station on the}} New York City Subway's IND Rockaway Line. Originally a Long Island Rail Road station, it is the full-time southern terminal for the A train and the easternmost station on the New York City Subway. , this station is the busiest of all subway stations in the Rockaway peninsula. The original surface station on <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> opened in 1869; the current elevated station began operation as a subway station on January 16, 1958.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{its range}} is {{currently}} restricted to about 45km {{of the banks}} of the River Ouse centred on York, North Yorkshire. Although there are scattered records from across England some of these may represent mis-identifications of the mint beetle, a more widespread species. Tansy beetles had previously been recorded from Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, where species of mint (Mentha spp.), not tansy, acted as the host plant. The last accurate record for the beetle at <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> in 1981. In August 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at Woodwalton Fen, following which a relocation programme involving hundreds of adult beetles from Yorkshire to <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> undertaken. As of 2006 there were 19 British hectads (10km squares) with records of the tansy beetle, but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970, six of which are centred around York. In 2015, the total number of individuals estimated from a survey of this area on {{the banks of the}} River Ouse was 24,000. In 2016 this number increased significantly to 40,000.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, 2002, U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham {{made the}} {{decision}} that <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> suitable to be the nation's nuclear repository. The governor of Nevada had 90days to object and did so. However, the United States Congress overrode the objection. If the governor's objection had stood the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen. In August 2004, the repository became an election issue, when Senator John Kerry (D) said that he would abandon the plans if elected.|$|E
5|$|The Roman fortress' layout {{is similar}} to other {{imperial}} outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the 3rd century CE was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby Yotvata bears. <b>This</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> {{the largest in the}} area at , and included four projecting towers on the fortress' corners. Artefacts tell of probably destruction {{in the middle of the}} fourth century CE, perhaps by a 344 earthquake, though it was promptly rebuilt with improved, stone flooring and again destroyed two decades later, probably from an earthquake in 363.|$|E
5|$|The city of Chester was an {{important}} Roman stronghold. There {{may have been a}} Christian basilica {{on the site of the}} present cathedral in the late Roman era, while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to Saint Paul and Saint Peter. This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> changed from SaintPeter to SaintWerburgh.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} Paleo Indians <b>sites.</b> One <b>is</b> in Sussex County {{and the other}} three are near. The Zierdt <b>site</b> <b>is</b> located near the Delaware River in Montaque Township.

Caribou bones and a spear point <b>was</b> located at <b>this</b> <b>site.</b> The third <b>is</b> the Shawnee <b>site</b> located north of the Delaware Water Gap {{on the west side of}} the river, where Broadhead Creek enters the Delaware in Pennsylvania. <b>This</b> <b>site</b> <b>is</b> dated from {{charcoal}} found at 8640 B.C. + or - 300 years The last <b>site</b> <b>is</b> the Plenge <b>site</b> located on the north side of the Musconetcong River in Franklin Township, Warren County. <b>This</b> <b>site</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 10,000 B.C.|$|R

5|$|The {{day after}} the battle of Olintepeque, the Spanish army arrived at Tzakahá, which {{submitted}} peacefully. There the Spanish chaplains Juan Godinez and Juan Díaz conducted a Roman Catholic mass under a makeshift roof; <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> chosen to build the first church in Guatemala, which was dedicated to Concepción La Conquistadora. Tzakahá was renamed as San Luis Salcajá. The first Easter mass held in Guatemala was celebrated in the new church, during which high-ranking natives were baptised.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church on}} <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> built in Saxon times, as the Port of Bristol first began. In medieval times, St. Mary Redcliffe, {{sitting on a}} red cliff above the River Avon, was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for their souls and {{many of whom are}} commemorated there.|$|E
5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on <b>this</b> <b>site</b> <b>was</b> controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
