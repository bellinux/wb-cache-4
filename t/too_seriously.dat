5|$|Emilio del Guercio {{said that}} the toy arrow {{represents}} absurdity and the teardrop sentimentality and melancholy. According to Argentine graphic artist Rep, the artwork conveys a grotesque, dramatic flavor and {{the feeling that the}} album should be taken seriously but not <b>too</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{secretly}} suppressing {{her feelings}} for Mark, Lexie and Alex assume a casual relationship, that Lexie {{begins to take}} <b>too</b> <b>seriously</b> and flaunts to make Mark jealous. Lexie is able to use her eiditic memory to help Alex with several of his cases. Meanwhile, Mark and Lexie never seem to get their timing right, with Lexie disinterested and angry at Mark when he wishes to reconcile, or Mark being caught sleeping with a flavor {{of the day when}} Lexie wants to rekindle their relationship.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients <b>too</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the time they {{reached the top of the}} mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white Latin cross brassard, identifying him as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as they carried no weapons.|$|E
50|$|In another attack, five Legionnaires {{are killed}} and Edwards is mortally wounded. He places Forbes in command. Almost making it back safely, Forbes, <b>too,</b> is <b>seriously</b> wounded and expires as Sgt. Major Benet drags {{him back to}} the fort.|$|R

5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it <b>too</b> <b>seriously.</b> Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{on the world stage}} at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself <b>too</b> <b>seriously,</b> however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding {{in the back of a}} van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been <b>too</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded to continue.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, Richard Plantagenet was universally {{looked upon}} as Henry's successor, and the time seemed to be drawing nigh when the change of dynasty was to take place. Henry's health was very feeble. He seemed to be rapidly declining. His mind was affected, <b>too,</b> quite <b>seriously,</b> and he {{sometimes}} sank into a species of torpor from which nothing could arouse him.|$|R

25|$|Another theory {{explaining}} {{the existence of}} the seacoast in Bohemia offered by C. H. Herford is suggested in Shakespeare's chosen title of the play. A winter's tale is something associated with parents telling children stories of legends around a fireside: by using this title, it implies to the audience that these details should not be taken <b>too</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War in 1945, the British {{railways}} {{were worn}} out, having been patched up following war damage without the availability of much new material. The country was economically in a weak situation also, and for nearly a decade after the war, materials - especially steel and timber - were in very short supply. Labour <b>too</b> was <b>seriously</b> restricted in availability.|$|R

25|$|The British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans criticized Nolte, {{accusing him}} of taking <b>too</b> <b>seriously</b> the work of Holocaust deniers, whom Evans called cranks, not historians. Likewise, Evans charged that Nolte was guilty of making assertions unsupported by the evidence, such as claiming that SS massacres of Russian Jews were a form of counterinsurgency, or taking at face value the self-justifying claims of German generals who professed to be ignorant of the Shoah.|$|E
25|$|According to the French authorities, {{there were}} officially eight deaths. The identities of {{seven of them}} are known: Carlo Tasso from Alessandria, Vittorio Caffaro from Pinerolo, Bartolomeo Calori from Turin, Giuseppe Merlo from Centallo, Lorenzo Rolando from Altare, Paolo Zanetti from Nese and Giovanni Bonetto. The body of a ninth Italian, Secondo Torchio, was never recovered. Following the events, 17 Italians were <b>too</b> <b>seriously</b> injured to be {{evacuated}} by train - one of them died of tetanus a month later.|$|E
25|$|Leslie {{represents}} Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle) {{in their}} lawsuit against their father, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Eventually, their brother Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) joins the lawsuit. Under Leslie's representation, the Newman children win the lawsuit, winning $500 million each. Leslie begins having an on-and-off romance with Jabot Cosmetics executive Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), which neither take <b>too</b> <b>seriously.</b> She represents Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) twice; once during a custody battle for Phyllis' granddaughter Lucy, {{and a second}} {{time when she was}} put on trial for attempted murder.|$|E
50|$|The French {{were unaware}} of German {{numerical}} superiority {{at the beginning of}} the battle as the German 2nd Army did not attack all at once. Treating the oncoming attacks as merely skirmishes, Frossard did not request additional support from other units. By the time he realized what kind of a force he was opposing, it was <b>too</b> late. <b>Seriously</b> flawed communications between Frossard and those in reserve under Bazaine slowed down so much that by the time the reserves received orders to move out to Spicheren, German soldiers from the 1st and 2nd Armies had charged up the heights.|$|R
50|$|Crimes against {{journalists have}} {{declined}} in the recent years. Although no Croatian journalist has lost her/his life lately, threats against journalists persist. Yet, courts have lately started taking verbal threats more <b>seriously</b> <b>too.</b> 2015 marked a deterioration of the situation, with 14 cases reported between May and August alone, compared to the 24 cases in May 2014/May 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Written {{mainly by}} vocalist Kola Krauze, Dark Heresy's lyrics were as long and complex as its music. Dealing with themes such as religion, antireligion (often with a {{specifically}} anti-Christian sentiment), Germanic paganism and the Middle Ages, {{they were also}} highly unusual for their time (in the context of death metal) for focusing {{at least as much}} on love and eroticism. In 1995, Terrorizer described the band's lyrics, noting that they are [...] "extremely long and gather together many anti-Christian diatribes which are as clever as they are shocking or sardonic ... After hearing this CD, you <b>too</b> may <b>seriously</b> question many aspects about the spiritual self".|$|R
25|$|Stephen Hawking {{had shown}} earlier {{that the total}} horizon area of a {{collection}} of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase, but at first, he did not take the analogy <b>too</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1989, when Cecil {{was still}} working at Activison, he decided to set up his own {{development}} studio. He contacted Tony Warriner, {{who had worked with}} him at Artic Computing and Paragon Programming, and Warriner brought in a fellow programmer, David Sykes. Together with Noirin Carmody, his then-partner and General Manager at Activision UK, they founded Revolution Software (March 1990). The company was originally located in Hull, but moved to York in 1994. Besides becoming Revolution's managing director, Cecil would focus from the start on writing and design. At that time the graphic adventure genre was dominated by LucasArts and Sierra On-Line, and they wanted to create something in between, an adventure game that didn't take itself <b>too</b> <b>seriously,</b> but did have a serious story. For Revolution's first title, Cecil conceived with others an innovative game engine, called Virtual Theatre, and the engine itself was designed by Tony Warriner. The result was Lure of the Temptress (1992), and though it was their first product, it became one of the successful games that would follow. For the second title, Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), often referred to as a cult classic, Cecil contacted comic book artist Dave Gibbons. He had met Gibbons when he was still at Activision, and he admired Gibbons's work on Watchmen. Gibbons became involved {{in the design of the}} game, and their collaboration would inspire Cecil's next move.|$|E
25|$|Even before news of {{the defeat}} at the Ticinus River had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered the consul Sempronius Longus to bring his army back from Sicily, {{where it had been}} {{preparing}} for the invasion of Africa, to join Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal was blocking Sempronius' way to Scipio's army. However, the Carthaginian capture of the supply depot at Clastidium, through the treachery of the local Latin commander, served as a diversion and allowed Sempronius' army to slip through to Scipio, who was still <b>too</b> <b>seriously</b> injured to take the field. After some minor successes, the united and numerically equal Roman force under the command of Sempronius Longus was lured into combat by Hannibal at the battle of the Trebia. The Roman troops were drawn into the engagement without breakfast and first had to cross a cold river, preventing many from putting up much of a fight. Furthermore, a hidden detachment led by Hannibal's younger brother Mago attacked them from the rear. All in all, the Romans suffered heavy losses with only 20,000 men out of 40,000 able to retreat to safety. They left Cisalpine Gaul in the aftermath. Having secured his position in northern Italy by this victory, Hannibal quartered his troops for the winter amongst the Gauls. The latter joined his army in large numbers, bringing it up to 60,000 men; their enthusiasm was somewhat reduced due to the Carthaginians living on their land.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss and {{demonstrate}} the importance of several factors relative {{to the relationship between}} time and evolution of biosequences. In both quantitative and qualitative measurements of the genetic distances, the compositional constraints of the nucleotide sequences play a very important role. We demonstrate that when homologous sequences significantly differ in base composition we get erratic branching order and/or wrong evaluation of the evolutionary rates. We must consider that every gene may have a different evolutionary dynamic along its sequence, generally linked to its functional constraints; this <b>too</b> can <b>seriously</b> affect its clocklike behavior. We report some cases showing how these factors can affect the quantitative measurements of the genetic distances of biosequences...|$|R
50|$|In 840, {{the retired}} Emperor Junna died. Two years later, {{in the summer}} of 842, Saga <b>too</b> became <b>seriously</b> sick. Sensing danger, Crown Prince Tsunesada's {{attendant}} Tomo no Kowamine (伴健岑) and his friend Tachibana no Hayanari, the provisional governor of Tajima Province, expected an attack on the Crown Prince, and planned to take Tsunesada to the eastern provinces. They consulted with Prince Abo, a son of Emperor Heizei, on the matter. Abo did not want to participate, and secretly reported the plot to Tachibana no Kachiko, who was also Hayanari's cousin. Surprised at the seriousness of the situation, Kachiko further consulted on the matter with the chūnagon Yoshifusa himself. Naturally, Yoshifusa reported this to Emperor Ninmyō.|$|R

In addition Berardinelli praised John Williams' film score, which he felt was [...] "more intimate and jazzy than his usual material, evoking (intentionally) Henry Mancini". Peter Travers was one of few who gave the film a negative review. Travers considered Catch Me if You Can to be [...] "bogged down over 140 minutes.

50|$|His speech, {{which had}} {{departed}} {{far from the}} usual formal paean to the monarch's words and criticised the central pillar of government policy, elicited considerable outrage. It was {{the peak of his}} career as a working peer. From this point, his contributions became briefer and less frequent. This roughly corresponds to the onset of important family bereavements. Hyacinth Anne, his daughter had died in July 1847 after a long struggle against tuberculosis. His wife, Hyacinthe Mary, <b>too</b> became <b>seriously</b> ill, dying at the beginning of 1849. Hatherton served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire between 1854 and 1863 - an honorific local post with considerable ceremonial duties that perhaps filled his time as he himself became less able to travel. His last contribution to debate, in 1852, was characteristically trenchant attack on the arrogance of the telegraph companies who inconvenienced residents without notice, and a demand that they pay compensation.|$|R
