5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, American {{intellectual}} Noam Chomsky argued that Israeli claims that <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> rejected the international consensus {{calling for a}} Palestinian state, with borders along the Green Line, were {{not consistent with the}} documented record. In 2008 Al Jazeera and Haaretz both reported that elements in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> even inside Hamas, have called for a two-state settlement based on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line). Although Hamas' official policy is committed to Israel's destruction, Ismail Haniya, the prime minister of the Palestinian unity government until June 2007, suggested that a long-term truce with Israel could be achieved if Israel withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The WOJAC functioned for {{approximately}} 25 years (from 1975 until 1999). WOJAC's aspiration was {{to operate in}} the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> on the right to the land and on the refugee question.|$|E

Their entire terror apparatus must be dismantled, and they must be replaced by a new <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> devoted to peace.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Gaza, where Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in a violent civil war with rival Fatah, Israel placed restrictions on its border with Gaza borders and ended economic cooperation with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> based there. Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade of the Gaza Strip since 2007. Israel maintains the blockade is necessary to limit Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza and to prevent Hamas from smuggling advanced rockets and weapons capable of hitting its cities.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aim of}} marginalising the settlers' {{more militant}} wing, Barak courted {{moderate}} settler opinion, securing agreement for the dismantlement of 12 new outposts that had been constructed since the Wye River Agreement of November 1998, but the continued expansion of existing settlements with plans for 3,000 new houses in the West Bank drew strong condemnation from <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership.</b> Though construction within existing settlements was permitted under the Oslo agreements, Palestinian supporters contend that any continued construction was contrary to its spirit, prejudiced the outcome of final status negotiations, and undermined Palestinian confidence in Barak's desire for peace.|$|E
25|$|Al-Haj Ibrahim {{moved to}} Amman, Jordan after fleeing Haifa upon its capture by Jewish forces. He wrote memoirs of his {{experience}} in Palestine from 1947 to the early 1950s. They mostly outlined the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> regarding {{the circumstances of the}} city's fall, and exposing its performance and political discourse during the British Mandate period. Al-Haj Ibrahim died in Amman in 1953, and was buried in Damascus, Syria. Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi edited and published his memoirs, titled Defending Haifa and the Problem of Palestine: The Memoirs of Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, 1891-1953, in the Institute for Palestine Studies, Beirut, in 2006.|$|E

50|$|After {{several years}} of advocating a {{democratic}} one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Whitbeck has supported <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership's</b> initiative to increase diplomatic recognitions and obtain United Nations membership for the State of Palestine, and he was invited by the United Nations to address the UN Latin American and Caribbean Meeting in Support of Israeli-Palestinian Peace, held in Montevideo in March 2011, on {{the applicability of the}} Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States to the State of Palestine.|$|R
25|$|Activists {{say there}} is a growing {{crackdown}} on writers who criticize the Palestinian Government. According to Executive Director of Advancing Human Rights David Keyes, in 2013, Anas Awwad, a 26-year-old Palestinian activist, was sentenced in absentia by a Palestinian court in Nablus, the West Bank, to one year in prison for “extending his tongue” against the Palestinian Authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Facebook. Keyes also states that in 2012, Palestinian blogger Jamal Abu Rihan was arrested by the Palestinian Authority for starting a Facebook campaign called “The People Want an End to Corruption,” he was indicted under the charges of“extending his tongue” against <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Peled—member of the Left Camp of Israel Executive {{for the whole}} of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf—claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> {{representing}} its entire people, could not be expected to make in a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if and when it came to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP—with Peled and Avnery at its head—became a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction.|$|E
25|$|On November 11, 2004 Arafat {{died at the}} Percy {{training}} {{hospital of}} the Armies near Paris. He {{was buried in the}} courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Aurhority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting territorial solution.|$|E

50|$|Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab {{movements}} {{has played}} a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership's</b> own policies. As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day. During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian baathists broke from the Palestine Liberation Organization and allied with the Shia Amal Movement, fighting a bloody civil war that killed thousands of Palestinians.|$|R
5000|$|David Bedein, {{the bureau}} chief of the Israel Resource News Agency, {{expressed}} disappointment that [...] "Dershowitz has now adopted a strategy of 'if you can’t beat them, join them.'" [...] Bedein criticizes several of Dershowitz's positions individually, giving each [...] "error" [...] its own section arguing that they are oblivious to reality. He feels the author's [...] "failure to challenge questionable assumptions about the prospects for peace is deeply regrettable. By exaggerating <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership’s</b> readiness to make peace, Dershowitz has granted credibility to those critics, many of them rank anti-Semites, who are desperate to blame the persistence of the conflict on Israel." ...|$|R
25|$|Consulted by {{a senior}} {{figure of the}} PLO during the siege of Beirut, he set forth five {{political}} principles that would prove conducive to securing the PLO's political battle on a firmer footing. (1) Abandon Beirut (2) {{put an end to}} terrorism (3) relocate in Tunis, the only area where <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> could enjoy real political liberty (4) set up a provisory government, which would immediately be recognized by at least 150 countries (5) recognize Israel. If these measures were taken, Goldmann advised, the PLO would establish the basis {{for the creation of a}} Palestinian state, alongside that of Israel. Goldmann's vision was to make Israel the spiritual and moral center for all Jews, a neutral state, and somewhat on the model of Switzerland, with international guarantees of its security, existence and borders, and perhaps even a permanent symbolic international presence.|$|E
25|$|During the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, ties {{were made}} between the Arab {{leadership}} in Palestine and the Nazi movement in Germany. These connections led to cooperation between the Palestinian national movement and the Axis powers later on during World War II. In May 1941 Amin al-Husayni issued a fatwa for a holy war against Britain. In 1941 during a meeting with Adolf Hitler Amin al-Husayni asked Germany to oppose, {{as part of the}} Arab struggle for independence, the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. He received a promise from Hitler that Germany would eliminate the existing Jewish foundations in Palestine after the Germans had gained victory in the war. During the war Amin al-Husayni joined the Nazis, serving with the Waffen SS in Bosnia and Yugoslavia. In addition, during the war a joint Palestinian-Nazi military operation was held in the region of Palestine. These factors caused a deterioration in the relations between <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> and the British, which turned to collaborate with the Yeshuv during the period known as the 200 days of dread.|$|E
500|$|In a {{reference}} to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat is mentioned by name. Even though foreign dignitaries were normally fictional on the show, producer Aaron Sorkin said it felt right to call the Chairman by his real name [...] "'cause Arafat's been around forever and he'll be around forever". In a later episode, however ("Gaza" [...] in season five), {{the name of the}} Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar Farad, a fictional character. By that point in mid-2004, Arafat was in failing health in real life, and would die in November 2004. The show continued to use the Farad character and never made any references to Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas.|$|E

50|$|Despite its lofty {{declarations}} and goals, the All-Palestine Government {{proved to}} be generally ineffectual. <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs, and <b>the</b> Arab world in general, were shocked by the speed and extent of the Israeli victories, and the poor showing of the Arab armies. This, combined with the expansionist designs of King Abdullah, cast <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arab <b>leadership</b> into disarray.|$|R
50|$|Israel’s {{decision}} {{to withdraw from}} the Phildelphi Route also posed a threat to the neighboring Egyptians through the potential militarization of Gaza. It was feared that Israel’s departure would create a power vacuum that <b>the</b> weak <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> {{would not be able to}} fill, thus creating a void to be filled by radical Islamists.|$|R
500|$|While {{fighting}} was on hold, the British government {{announced it would}} not restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine and instead proposed a partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states as put forward by the Peel Commission (November 1936–January 1937.) These moves antagonized <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> whose principal concern was increased Jewish settlement. Thus, they boycotted the commission from the time it began its work. The AHC under the chairmanship of Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, requested rebel leaders return and resume military activities in Palestine to pressure the authorities. To that end, al-Hajj Muhammad returned to Palestine in April to command his fasa'il in the Tulkarm-Jenin-Nablus region, which was referred to by the authorities as the [...] "Triangle of Terror" [...] due to the concentration of rebel activity in the area.|$|E

40|$|The Israeli-Palestinian {{conflict}} is currently {{embroiled in a}} deep-seeded political impasse. The source of this diplomatic deadlock is the separate theoretical trajectories characterising each side s approach to the conflict. Israel is more content with managing the conflict whilst <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaderships</b> desperately seek an outright resolution. Alternatively, at <b>the</b> grassroots level <b>Palestinians</b> are far more concerned with effectuating change in their own personal circumstances. This encompasses issues which do not directly relate to <b>the</b> resolution <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaderships</b> seek. A distinct switch in discourse from nationalism to human and civil rights is occurring on the ground. Such a switch exemplifies this political disillusionment and {{is indicative of the}} alternative theory conflict transformation theory. Parlevliet argues conflict transformation should be analysed in conjunction with human rights. In this regard, the current climate in Israel-Palestine offers a unique case study in which to apply and answer Parlevliet s call. In doing so, this study takes Lederach s contribution to the theory of conflict transformation and analyses it alongside Parlevliet s argument in relation to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and the growing call for human rights. It demonstrates the multi-layered and holistic nature of the human rights argument by showing how the switch in discourse attempts to address issues along the micro-macro spectrum. In accordance with conflict transformation, the thesis draws upon a number of theories and methodologies to explicate how the switch to a human rights discourse circumnavigates a host of ideological and political barriers, which impede a possible resolution to the much protracted conflict. It concludes by exposing the cyclical nature of the micro-macro polemics, and how they ultimately reinforce each other in strangling any diplomatic possibility for opening up more alternative discourses to the current political approaches to the conflict...|$|R
