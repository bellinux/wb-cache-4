40|$|Objective: Nociception is {{the major}} cause of burn pain and leads to central hyperalgesia. Gabapentin (Gp) is an antihyperalgesic drug that {{selectively}} affects central sensitization. We studied the opioid-sparing and analgesic effects of Gp in severely burned patients. Methods: Ten patients (mean <b>total</b> burned <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (TBSA), 25 %), received 2400 mg of oral Gp daily from after burn days 3 - 24 in addition to standard pain therapy. They were compared to a retrospective matching group. Outcomes were cumulative morphine consumption and mean daily pain scores. Outcomes were recorded during treatment (21 days) and 21 days after treatment. Results: During treatment and post-treatment phases, patients receiving Gp had cumulative morphine consumption and a mean daily pain score significantly lower than controls. Conclusion: Gp use reduced opioid consumption and lowered pain scores that seemed to extend beyond its pharmacologic action probably result from the ability of Gp to prevent central hyperalgesia induced by burns.

40|$|Organ {{dysfunction}} {{and failure}} {{are important for}} burned patients as they increase morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence has suggested that organ injuries are occurring earlier after burns, and are more common, than previously thought. In this study we have assessed {{the extent to which}} liver function, assessed by the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDRICG), is affected in patients with severe burns. This is a prospective, descriptive exploratory study at a national burn centre. Consecutive adult patients with a <b>total</b> burned <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (TBSA%) of 20 % or more, were examined prospectively by dynamic (PDRICG) and static liver function tests (plasma: bilirubin concentration, prothrombin complex, and alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities). Early liver dysfunction was common, as assessed by both dynamic (7 of 17) and static liver function tests (6 - 17 of 17). A regression model showed that changes in PDRICG were associated with age, TBSA%, plasma bilirubin concentration, plasma C-reactive protein concentration, and cardiac index. Persistent and advanced hepatic dysfunction was associated with mortality. The PDRICG seems to give a comprehensive assessment of liver function after major burns. Hepatic dysfunction seems to be as common as dysfunction in other organs. We interpret the recorded effects on liver function as part of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, primarily induced by the burn itself. However, this needs to be further investigated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the roles of the Taql and Bsml vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in hospital mortality of burn patients. METHODS: In total, 105 consecutive burn injury patients over 18 years in age who were admitted to the Burn Unit of Bauru State Hospital from January to December 2013 were prospectively evaluated. Upon admission, patient demographic information was recorded and a blood sample was taken for biochemical analysis to identify the presence of the Taql(rs 731236) and Bsml(rs 1544410) polymorphisms. All of the patients were followed over their hospital stay and mortality was recorded. RESULTS: Eighteen of the patients did not sign the informed consent form, and there were technical problems with genotype analysis for 7 of the patients. Thus, 80 patients (mean age, 42. 5 ± 16. 1 years) were included in the final analysis. In total, 60 % of the patients were male, and 16. 3 % died during the hospital stay. The genotype frequencies for the Taql polymorphism were 51. 25 % TT, 41. 25 % TC and 7. 50 % CC; for the Bsml polymorphism, they were 51. 25 % GG, 42. 50 % GA and 6. 25 % AA.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to make a comparative evaluation of {{the quality of life of}} pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and vitiligo and correlate the findings with the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> and the <b>areas</b> with the disease exposed to view. METHODS: The sample consisted of 118 patients with atopic dermatitis, vitiligo and psoriasis, aged between 5 and 16 years, who were asked to answer the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) questionnaire. A dermatological examination for the measurement of <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> affected by the disease was performed. RESULTS: The three groups showed an impaired quality of life. Patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis showed a significantly greater impact on the QoL than the group with vitiligo. There is a trend towards impaired quality of life in patients from the three groups of dermatoses, which is related to increments in both the total affected area and affected area exposed to view (r = 0. 428 and p < 0. 001, r = 0. 381 and p < 0. 001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The assessed children had impaired quality of life. However, there is a significantly greater impact in the groups with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis than in the group with vitiligo.

The aim of this study was to assess whether treatment with corticosteroids may lead to faster improvement of organ dysfunction in severely burned patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who were admitted to a burn centre intensive care unit between 2006 and 2009. Patients aged over 18 with > 20 % <b>total</b> burned <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (TBSA) or 15 - 20 % TBSA and had inhalation injury were included. Patients who received a corticosteroid stress treatment starting at day 1 were compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. The primary outcome was the improvement compared to baseline in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 6, 12 and 20 days after admission. Results Thirty-eight patients were identified of which 14 had received corticosteroid treatment. Patients in the corticosteroid group were of comparative age (44. 5 vs 48. 5 years, p= 0. 58), had higher TBSA (40. 6 vs 30. 4 %, p= 0. 03), and more frequently inhalation injury (78. 6 vs 39. 1 % p= 0. 04). The SOFA score decreased from 6. 0 to 3. 8 at day 6 for the corticosteroid group versus 3. 2 to 2. 4 (P= 0. 01) for controls. The decrease in SOFA score in the corticosteroid group was also greater at 12 and 20 days (p< 0. 05). This effect remained significant after correction for age, TBSA, and inhalation injury. Similar results were seen in the need for fluid resuscitation. From day 2 to day 6 the corticosteroid group had a faster decrease of amount of fluid needed (p< 0. 05). In addition, in 4 patients in who corticosteroid treatment was started late (day 11 (± 1) postburn), a fast decrease in SOFA scores was seen as well. Conclusions SOFA-scores in severely burned patients who received corticosteroid treatment improved more rapidly than in those without corticosteroid treatment. A prospective randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm safety and efficacy of corticosteroid treatment in this category of patients. ...|$|R
40|$|Burn wound {{infection}} (BWI) is a {{major public}} health problem and the most devastating form of trauma worldwide. Fungi cause BWI as part of monomicrobial or polymicrobial infection, fungaemia, rare aggressive soft tissue infection and as opportunistic infections. The risk factors for acquiring fungal infection in burns include age of burns, <b>total</b> burn size, <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (BSA) (30 – 60 %), full thickness burns, inhalational injury, prolonged hospital stay, late surgical excision, open dressing, artificial dermis, central venous catheters, antibiotics, steroid treatment, long-term artificial ventilation, fungal wound colonisation (FWC), hyperglycaemic episodes and other immunosuppressive disorders. Most of the fungal infections are missed owing to lack of clinical awareness and similar presentation as bacterial infection coupled with paucity of mycology laboratories. Expedient {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these mycoses can be life-saving as the mortality is otherwise very high. Emergence of resistance in non-albicans Candida spp., unusual yeasts and moulds in fungal BWI, leaves very few fungi susceptible to antifungal drugs, leaving many patients susceptible. There is a need to speciate fungi as far as the topical and systemic antifungal is concerned. Deep tissue biopsy and other relevant samples are processed by standard mycological procedures using direct microscopy, culture and histopathological examination. Patients with FWC should be treated by aggressive surgical debridement and, in the case of fungal wound infection (FWI), in addition to surgical debridement, an intravenous antifungal drug, most commonly amphotericin B or caspofungin, is prescribed followed by de-escalating with voriconazole or itraconazole, or fluconazole depending upon the species or antifungal susceptibility, if available. The propensity for fungal infection increases, the longer the wound is present. Therefore, the development of products to close the wound more rapidly, improvement in topical antifungal therapy with mould activity and implementation of appropriate systemic antifungal therapy guided by antifungal susceptibility may improve the outcome for severely injured burn victims...|$|R

Methodology: This retrospective study analyzed 188 female in-patients, from age 18 and onwards with burn injuries from workplace or non-working sites that were treated between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. The analysis was focused on burn-related characteristics and analyzed descriptively. The material consisted of electronic and hand written medical records, taken from the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. The causes of the burns, the location of the injured area, the depth and size of the burn, and the duration of burn treatment were examined. Results: The most common burn causes were hot liquid 50. 4 %, followed by flame burns 43. 8 %. The most common locations were upper limb 22. 9 % and lower limb 23. 4 %, the average <b>total</b> burned <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> was 12, 8 % and the most common degree of burn injuries was 2 nd degree (65, 96 %).

Patients aged 2 years or older with an affected <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of more than 5 %, who previously participated in a clinical trial on tacrolimus ointment, were eligible for this study.

The intent-to-treat population comprised 782 patients, with a median age of 22 years (range 2 - 72). Patients remained in the study for up to 4 years. Approximately half of the patients discontinued the study prematurely; the median follow-up was 1422 days.

Altogether 51. 8 % of patients discontinued the study prematurely; the main reasons were withdrawal of consent (13. 3 %), loss to follow-up (11. 3 %) and lack of efficacy (9. 4 %). Adverse events led to study discontinuation in 3. 7 % of the patients. The most frequent application site events were skin burning and pruritus. These events were most often reported in adult patients during the initial treatment period; prevalence decreased after the first week and remained at a low level throughout the study.

The safety profile of intermittent or continuous long-term application of 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment for up to 4 years was consistent with that which has been established from shorter studies and gave no reason for concern. In addition, 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment demonstrated sustained efficacy as reflected by the expression of high satisfaction with treatment by both patients and investigator...|$|R
40|$|FUNDAMENTOS: A pele é a {{principal}} interface do ser humano com o meio externo e a presença de doenças cutâneas pode levar a repercussões importantes na qualidade de vida. OBJETIVOS: O presente estudo tem como objetivo fazer uma avaliação comparativa entre a qualidade de vida dos pacientes pediátricos com dermatite atópica, vitiligo e psoríase e correlacioná-la à superfície corporal total e às áreas expostas à visualização acometidas pela doença. MÉTODOS: Amostra composta por 118 pacientes com dermatite atópica, vitiligo e psoríase na faixa etária entre 5 a 16 anos para a aplicação do questionário Índice de Qualidade de Vida para Dermatologia em Crianças (CDLQI). Realizado exame dermatológico para a aferição da superfície corporal total acometida pela doença. RESULTADOS: Os três grupos de pacientes pediátricos demonstraram ter redução na qualidade de vida. Os pacientes com dermatite atópica e psoríase apresentaram um impacto na QoL significativamente maior que o grupo com vitiligo. Há uma tendência na redução da qualidade de vida dos pacientes dos três grupos de dermatoses relacionado ao aumento tanto da superfície total quanto da superfície exposta à visualização (r= 0, 428 e p< 0, 001; r= 0, 381 e p< 0, 001, respectivamente). CONCLUSÃO: As crianças avaliadas com dermatite atópica, psoríase e vitiligo apresentaram redução na qualidade de vida. Porém, há um impacto significativamente maior nos grupos de pacientes com dermatite atópica e psoríase em relação ao grupo com vitiligo. Este fato pode dever-se a ausência de sintomas no vitiligo e ao grupo ter apresentado uma superfície corporal comprometida estatisticamente menor que outros dois grupos. BACKGROUND: The skin {{is the primary}} interface {{of the human being}} with the external environment and the presence of skin diseases can have substantial effects on the quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to make a comparative evaluation of {{the quality of life of}} pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and vitiligo and correlate the findings with the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> and the <b>areas</b> with the disease exposed to view. METHODS: The sample consisted of 118 patients with atopic dermatitis, vitiligo and psoriasis, aged between 5 and 16 years, who were asked to answer the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) questionnaire. A dermatological examination for the measurement of <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> affected by the disease was performed. RESULTS: The three groups showed an impaired quality of life. Patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis showed a significantly greater impact on the QoL than the group with vitiligo. There is a trend towards impaired quality of life in patients from the three groups of dermatoses, which is related to increments in both the total affected area and affected area exposed to view (r = 0. 428 and p < 0. 001, r = 0. 381 and p < 0. 001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The assessed children had impaired quality of life. However, there is a significantly greater impact in the groups with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis than in the group with vitiligo. This may be due to lack of symptoms in vitiligo and the fact this group presented a statistically smaller affected <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> than the other two groups...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wound {{infection}} {{is the most}} frequent complication in burn patients. There {{is a lack of}} guidelines on the use of systemic antibiotics in children to prevent this complication. Patients and Methods: A prospective study is carried out on 80 patients to evaluate the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in the control of infections. Results: The mean age was 34 months (9 months to 8 years). There was a male predominance with sex ratio of 1. 66. The mean burn surface size burn was 26. 5 % with total burn <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> ranging from 5 % to 33 %, respectively. According to American Burn Association 37 % (30 / 80) were severe burns with second and third degree burns > 10 % of the <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>body</b> <b>area</b> in children aged < 10 years old. Scalds represented 76. 2 % (61 / 80) of the burns. Burns by hot oil were 11 cases (13. 7 %), while 8 cases (10 %) were flame burns. The random distribution of the groups was as follow: Group A (amoxicilline + clavulanic acid) = 25 cases, Group B (oxacilline) = 20 cases and Group C (no antibiotics) = 35 cases. Total infection rate was 20 % (16 / 80), distributed as follow: 8 cases (50 %) in Group C, 5 cases (31. 2 %) in Group A and 3 cases in Group B (18. 7 %). Infection rate in each individual group was: 22. 9 % (8 cases/ 35) in Group C, 20 % (5 cases/ 25) in Group A and 15 % (3 cases/ 20) in Group B (P = 0. 7). They were distributed as follow: Septicaemia 12 cases/ 16 (75 %), wound infection 4 cases/ 16 (25 %). Bacteria isolated were with a decreasing order: Staphylococcus aureus (36. 3 %), Pseudomonas (27. 2 %), Escherichia coli (18. 1 %), Klebsiella (9 %) and Enterobacteria (9 %). There is a tendency to a delayed cicatrisation (P = 0. 07) in case of hot oil burns (65. 18 ± 120 days) than by flame (54. 33 ± 19. 8 days) than by hot water (29. 55 ± 26. 2 days). Otherwise no toxic shock syndrome was recorded in this study. Conclusion: It is concluded that adequate and careful nursing of burn wounds seems to be sufficient to prevent complications and to obtain cicatrisation. Antibiotics are indicated only to treat confirmed infections...|$|R
