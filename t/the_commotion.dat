5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Mainstream, and limited touring and {{promotion}} in support of it, Cole left <b>the</b> <b>Commotions.</b> <b>The</b> chance to write and record new types of songs was the motivating factor.

5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents.

He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did <b>the</b> <b>commotion</b> in the saddling paddock.

5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during <b>the</b> <b>commotion,</b> three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, {{with the last}} of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing <b>the</b> <b>commotion,</b> the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E

Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, <b>the</b> <b>commotion</b> he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>commotion</b> {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E

Reza's cousin Ali Shirazi (Nicholas Guilak) arrives and, when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse, he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers.

When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing, Reza and Babak flee into an alley, shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas (Ray Haratian), one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in <b>the</b> <b>commotion.</b> After briefly being tended to, Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi Golestan (Mozhan Marnò).|$|E
5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} {{paid attention to the}} fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in <b>the</b> <b>commotion.</b> Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E
