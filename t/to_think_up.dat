500|$|In {{his attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>up</b> a new game, Naismith {{was guided by}} three main thoughts. Firstly, he {{analyzed}} the most popular games of those times (rugby, [...] lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and baseball); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball {{and concluded that the}} big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game duck on a rock. Naismith christened this new game [...] "Basket Ball" [...] and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.|$|E

In response, Graham stated: [...] "Back then, broadcasters just weren't comfortable with something like that, something that wasn't set in the real world and that had a fantasy element to it." [...] According to Graham, the initial idea was for a humorous, pre-watershed programme that overtly mocked the styles and attitudes of the 1970s, with the comic actor Neil Morrissey envisaged as the central character.|$|E

It was claimed that this tour, the cromleck, marked out a drunemeton, a central meeting point of the Tectosages. According to Boudet, the word dru-neme-ton {{was derived from the}} now obsolete English word trow (meaning to think or believe), and name.
