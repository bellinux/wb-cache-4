Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, and <b>tazobactam</b> in vitro inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy.

However, the compound is susceptible to degradation by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). <b>Tazobactam</b> is an ESBL inhibitor and is combined with ceftolozane to broaden its activity. Surprisingly, although <b>tazobactam</b> has been available for over 20 years, few if any reliable data exist on the <b>tazobactam</b> pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in mice. To evaluate the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships in mice, the PK properties of <b>tazobactam</b> and ceftolozane were extensively investigated. Thigh-infected neutropenic CD- 1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single 0. 1 -ml dose containing ceftolozane, <b>tazobactam,</b> or both compounds. Ceftolozane was applied in 2 -fold-increasing doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight to 64 mg/kg alone or in combination. <b>Tazobactam</b> was combined in reverse doses (thus, 64 / 4 mg/kg, 32 / 8 mg/kg, etc.) (n = 2 per time point). In separate validation experiments, ceftolozane-tazobactam was given alone or in combination at 32 / 8 mg/kg and 8 / 32 mg/kg (n = 4 per time point). Plasma samples (one per mouse) and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected at up to 12 time points until 6 h after administration. There {{were no significant differences}} in the ceftolozane and <b>tazobactam</b> PK alone versus combined, indicating no PK interaction. The PKs were linear and dose proportional for both compounds and showed a good penetration in the epithelial lining fluid. The estimated mean (standard deviation) half-life of ceftolozane was 0. 287 h (0. 031 h), and that of <b>tazobactam</b> was 0. 176 h (0. 026), and the V was 0. 43 liter/kg and 1. 14 liter/kg, respectively. The estimates of <b>tazobactam</b> parameters can also be used to (re) interpret PD data...|$|E
40|$|A simple, Accurate, precise {{method was}} {{developed}} for the simultaneous estimation of the Cefoperazone and <b>Tazobactam</b> in Tablet dosage form. Chromatogram was run through Kromasil C 18 250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 . Mobile phase containing Buffer Perchloric acid: Acetonitrile taken in the ratio 55 : 45 was pumped through column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Buffer used in this method was 0. 1 % Perchloric acid buffer. Temperature was maintained at 30 °C. Optimized wavelength selected was 230 nm. Retention time of Cefoperazone and <b>Tazobactam</b> {{were found to be}} 3. 751 min and 2. 568 min. %RSD of the Cefoperazone and <b>Tazobactam</b> were and found to be 0. 4 % and 0. 5 % respectively. %Recovery was obtained as 98. 77 % and 98. 58 % for Cefoperazone and <b>Tazobactam</b> respectively. LOD, LOQ values obtained from regression equations of Cefoperazone and <b>Tazobactam</b> were 0. 10, 0. 31 and 0. 02, 0. 05 respectively. Regression equation of Cefoperazone is y = 7979. x + 15373, and y = 19820 x + 5778 of <b>Tazobactam.</b> Retention times were decreased and run time was decreased, so the method developed was simple and economical that can be adopted in regular Quality control test in Industries.

40|$|A {{predictor}} {{panel of}} clinical isolates that produce {{a variety of}} types and amounts of beta-lactamases {{was used to assess}} the accuracy of dilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests for piperacillin-tazobactam. Combinations of piperacillin-tazobactam with a fixed ratio of 8 : 1 and with <b>tazobactam</b> held constant at 4 micrograms/ml were examined in dilution tests performed in agar. In addition, disks containing 100 and 10 micrograms of piperacillin and <b>tazobactam,</b> respectively, were examined in diffusion tests. Three very major discrepancies between MICs determined with an 8 : 1 ratio and MICs determined with <b>tazobactam</b> held constant at 4 micrograms/ml were noted. These involved strains that appeared to be susceptible in tests with the 8 : 1 ratio but resistant when <b>tazobactam</b> was held constant at 4 micrograms/ml. However, the differences were only twofold. Error rate-bounded analysis with the disk containing 100 and 10 micrograms of piperacillin and <b>tazobactam,</b> respectively, revealed low error rates, regardless of whether MICs were determined with an 8 : 1 ratio or <b>tazobactam</b> held constant at 4 micrograms/ml. Thus, a predictor panel was useful in the identification of accurate susceptibility test for piperacillin-tazobactam...|$|E

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are both dangerous as they cause life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Piperacillin <b>tazobactam</b> is a commonly used beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination for complicated abdominal and urinary tract infections. Under pharmacovigilance programme of India, few cases of hypokalemia which were attributed to piperacillin <b>tazobactam</b> therapy were reported.
