5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not know why; it is today known that {{this is due to}} the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E

5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C.mutica {{have been found in}} Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the sea chests of international shipping.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Khrushchev met {{and married}} his second wife, Marusia, whose maiden name is unknown. The two soon separated, though Khrushchev helped Marusia in later years, {{especially}} when Marusia's daughter by a previous relationship suffered a fatal illness. Soon after the abortive marriage, Khrushchev met Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants. The two lived together {{as husband and wife}} for the rest of Khrushchev's life, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not register their marriage until 1965. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{she first}} met Trinny Woodall {{at a party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not like each other at first, the two women {{proceeded}} to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 million.|$|E

With a squad made up of riders that normally ride in support for others, the team took a stage win (Klöden) and second overall (Janez Brajkovič) in the Giro del Trentino, also in April.|$|E
5|$|Nashville {{reached the}} postseason during six of their seven {{seasons in the}} Southern League. They won three Western Division titles and two Southern League Championships. The Sounds' 13years with the American Association at the Triple-A level was a vast contrast. The Sounds only managed three trips to the postseason, {{including}} two by virtue of winning the Eastern Division title. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not perform well during their first few years with the Pacific Coast League, the team {{went on to win}} four division titles, two American Conference titles, and one Pacific Coast League Championship between 2003 and 2007. The Sounds did not qualify again for postseason play until 2016 when they won the American Conference Southern Division title.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. They lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. The Iroquois and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that the Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> use the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it.|$|E
5|$|Australian aircrew {{supported}} the fighting on 6 June. No.453 Squadron {{was one of}} 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not encounter any German aircraft. No.456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided air defence for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that {{supported the}} landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew {{only a small number}} of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.|$|E
5|$|Blackrock is a play by Australian playwright Nick Enright {{that was}} first {{performed}} in 1995. It {{was adapted from}} a 1992 play by Enright, entitled A Property of the Clan, which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton, Australia in 1989. The plays were both well received critically, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> attract criticism from both Leigh's family and the media due to the fictionalisation of an actual murder. Despite repeated statements from Enright that the plays were a work of fiction, they have both often been considered by viewers to be a factual account. A Property of the Clan was shortlisted for a New South Wales Premier's Literary Award in 1993, and Blackrock won the AWGIE Award for Best Play in 1996. Blackrock was developed into a feature film of the same name in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Edward Moore Kennedy {{was born}} on February 22, 1932 at St. Margaret's Hospital in the Dorchester section of Boston, Massachusetts. He was the {{youngest}} of the nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald, members of prominent Irish American families in Boston who constituted one of the wealthiest families in the nation once they were joined. His eight elder siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, and Jean. John asked to be the newborn's godfather, a request his parents honored, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not agree to his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy (the newborn had entered the world on the first president's 200th birthday); they named him after their father's assistant instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. The Lancet averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The Lancet, which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E

5|$|In April, {{the team}} {{achieved}} great {{success in the}} Vuelta al País Vasco, with Contador winning the opening stage, which had seven categorized climbs, and the final individual time trial, to win the race overall. Just after the tour of the Basque country was the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, an event in which Astana won a stage with Grégory Rast and the points classification with Assan Bazayev. Later in the month, the team sent a squad headed by Leipheimer and Chris Horner to the Tour de Georgia. They did not win any stage, but Leipheimer took third overall, and Antonio Colóm fourth. The team was greatly successful at the Tour de Romandie later in the month, with Maxim Iglinskiy and Klöden both winning stages, and Klöden the race overall. In the Volta a Catalunya, which was concurrent to the Giro d'Italia, the team did not win any stage, with Janez Brajkovič's second in Stage 2 their closest result, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> win the teams classification.|$|E
5|$|Like the Kaiser Friedrich III-class ships, the Wittelsbachs were {{withdrawn}} from active service after {{the advent of}} the dreadnoughts. The five ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They were assigned to the IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. The ships were based in Kiel and placed under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. In early September 1914, the ships conducted a result-less sweep into the Baltic against the Russian navy operating there. In May 1915, four of the Wittelsbachs sailed into the Baltic and bombarded Libau, which was subsequently captured by the German army. The five ships of the class were moved to Libau during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not see any combat during the operation.|$|E
5|$|The first Europeans {{to come to}} {{the area}} in the {{vicinity}} of Darby Creek were the Dutch, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not establish any permanent settlements. In 1643, Swedish colonists led by Johan Printz established New Sweden near the confluence of Darby Creek and the Delaware River. The settlement they established served as the seat of government for the Swedes in North America for 12 years. They may have built impoundments in the creek to isolate marsh areas. Dutch settlers conquered the Swedish villages in 1655. In 1664, the Dutch surrendered the Darby Creek drainage basin to the English, who began settling the area after William Penn was issued a charter in 1681. The Darby Creek Ferry House, near the site of Printz's headquarters, was erected in 1694.|$|E
