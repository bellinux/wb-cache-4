5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool <b>the</b> <b>Bear.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>Bear</b> is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. <b>The</b> <b>bear</b> shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. <b>The</b> <b>Bear</b> catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
5|$|After many failed {{attempts}} {{to steal the}} teddy bear, in desperation, Mr. Burns has Smithers literally beg Homer for <b>the</b> <b>bear.</b> Homer tells Mr. Burns that it is Maggie's now, and {{she is the only}} one that can return it. Mr. Burns decides to talk to Maggie and becomes deeply depressed and asks Maggie to look after his bear. Maggie, in an act of pity, lets the desperate Mr. Burns have <b>the</b> <b>bear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used each time <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people {{to avoid an}} eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> will {{be less likely to}} continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} week of the 2012 regular season, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> and Vikings fought for a {{wildcard}} playoff spot, as <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> played <b>the</b> Lions and the Vikings played <b>the</b> Packers. <b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> won their game against the Lions, but the Vikings won their game against the Packers. Both teams finished with a 10-6 record. Due to a better division record than <b>the</b> <b>Bears,</b> <b>the</b> Vikings eliminated <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> from playoff contention with their win. <b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> and Vikings had split their series during the regular season, but because <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> were swept by the Packers and the Vikings had managed to split with the Packers, they edged out <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> to get into the playoffs. Because of <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> failing to make the playoffs, head coach Lovie Smith was fired soon after.|$|R
50|$|Thus, in {{the first}} 6 years of the NFL's existence, the Bears-Cardinals games had {{a direct impact on}} the league {{championship}} 4 times. <b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> and Cardinals each took home 1 title during that span. But <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> nearly cost <b>the</b> Cardinals their title, the Cardinals nearly cost <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> their title, and {{had it not been for}} the Cardinals' tenacity against <b>the</b> <b>Bears,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> very well might have won two more. <b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> were a dominant team against everyone but the Cardinals in the league's early years. From 1920-1925, the Canton Bulldogs, champions in 1922 and 1923, beat <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> just 2 times and no other team in the NFL defeated <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> more than once over that entire 6-year span... except for the Cardinals. The Cardinals battled <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> to 4-4-2 split between 1920-1925 and established the NFL's first rivalry.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> {{have been}} in several NCAA {{conferences}} over their 110-year history. In 1983, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> won <b>the</b> Pacific Soccer Conference. <b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> won <b>the</b> Mountain Pacific Men's Soccer Tournament in 1996.

5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording <b>the</b> <b>Bear</b> River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing <b>the</b> <b>Bear</b> River Divide and into <b>the</b> <b>Bear</b> River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow <b>the</b> <b>Bear</b> River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E
5|$|Grizzly Rage {{breaks the}} {{standard}} mold for many Syfy natural horror films in that <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> featured {{is a normal}} grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with <b>the</b> <b>bear.</b> Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bear</b> follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
50|$|On January 16, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> hired Marc Trestman to be <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> {{new head}} coach after Lovie Smith was fired.

50|$|With <b>the</b> win, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> opened <b>the</b> {{season with}} a 1-0 record. The 41 points scored by <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> were <b>the</b> most in a season opener since the 1986 season, when <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Cleveland Browns 41-31, and is also the first time <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> scored 41 points without a defensive/special teams touchdown since 1993.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco 49ers: In <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> and San Francisco 49ers {{have met}} {{twice in the}} postseason, {{as well as many}} times in the regular season. In the teams' first meeting in 1950, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> triumphed, 17-0. In <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> went 3-4, {{including}} 2 postseason meetings. The 49ers won the first meeting in a 23-0 shutout, as well as the next meeting, 28-3. In 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> claimed their revenge for their humiliating loss by sending in rookie William [...] "The Refrigerator" [...] Perry in at fullback in a 26-10 rout. Since <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> have lost all eight games at Candlestick Park, the last being a 32-7 loss in 2012. In the 49ers' new stadium Levi's Stadium's opening game against <b>the</b> <b>Bears,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> triumphed 28-20. However, the 49ers won the most recent meeting on December 6, 2015 at Soldier Field, defeating <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> 26-20.

5|$|Winnipeg <b>the</b> <b>Bear,</b> {{which would}} later become the {{inspiration}} {{for part of the}} name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse.

5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human.

5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. <b>The</b> <b>bear</b> is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, <b>the</b> <b>Bear</b> Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
