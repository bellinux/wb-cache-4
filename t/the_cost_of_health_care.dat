25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in {{retirement}} is large because {{people tend to}} be ill more frequently in later life. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare at age 65.

25|$|Just {{less than}} 9% of the {{population}} purchases individual health care insurance. Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a deductible), or {{a small part of}} the cost of every procedure (a copayment). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.|$|E
25|$|Two {{distinct}} premium {{support systems}} {{have recently been}} proposed in Congress to control the cost of Medicare. The House Republicans’ 2012 budget would have abolished traditional Medicare and required the eligible population to purchase private insurance with a newly created premium support program. This plan would have cut the cost of Medicare by capping {{the value of the}} voucher and tying its growth to inflation, which is expected to be lower than rising health costs, saving roughly $155 billion over 10 years. Paul Ryan, the plan’s author, claimed that competition would drive down costs, but the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the plan would dramatically raise <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> with all of the additional costs falling on enrollees. The CBO found that under the plan, typical 65-year-olds would go from paying 35 percent of their health care costs to paying 68 percent by 2030.|$|E

A 2005 study by the National Academy of Sciences argued that 30% of the health care spending in the United States was wasteful and subsequent research has supported this finding.
