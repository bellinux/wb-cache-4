25|$|Neonatal sidewinders {{engage in}} a {{remarkable}} behavioral homeothermy {{that has not been}} observed in any other type of snake. Following birth, the neonates mass together in their natal burrow. Most often, gravid females select an east-facing, small-diameter rodent burrow for giving birth. For the first week or so of their lives, neonatal sidewinders literally plug the entrance to this burrow during daylight hours, forming a dynamic multiple-individual mass that takes advantage of the hot exterior environment and the cool interior of the burrow to maintain an average aggregate temperature of 32°C (the optimal temperature for shedding). The dynamic mass of neonates modifies the <b>thermal</b> <b>environment</b> at the burrow entrance such that the young can occupy a location that would ordinarily become lethally hot for an individual neonate (or even an adult). Because of the constant movements of the neonates, the aggregate assumes stable temperature properties reminiscent of a homeothermic organism (i.e., maintains tight temperature tolerance ± 2°C).|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Danqun Fang {{participated in}} the preparatory work of an {{encyclopedia}} named as [...] "Environmental Science". He firstly proposed the concept of Environmental Physics in China, and claimed it as emerging disciplines, including Environmental Acoustics, Environmental Electromagnetic, <b>Thermal</b> <b>Environment,</b> Environmental Optics and Environmental Aerodynamics. The view got {{the full support of}} the famous Chinese acoustician Prof. Daa-You Maa and he acted as editor of the Environmental Physics. Environmental Physics officially became one of the five disciplines of Environmental Science in China. After that, he suggested the establishment of Environmental Physics Professional Committee within Environmental Sciences. In 1982, Danqun Fang established Environmental Physics Pollution Control Research Center in China with the support of Chinese Academy of Environmental Sciences and the cooperation of China Institute of Environmental Science, and presided over the daily works as a general vice director. Then, he published an article named [...] "Environmental Physics pollution and control strategy" [...] ("环境物理污染现状及其控制对策" [...] in Chinese) on the [...] "Physics"("物理" [...] in Chinese) magazine organized by the Chinese Physical Society, an article named [...] "physical pollution and countermeasures"("物理污染及对策" [...] in Chinese) on [...] "Technology Review"("科技导报" [...] in Chinese) hosted by China Science and Technology Association and a series of articles to introduce environmental physics and promote environmental physical awareness. Since 1984, Danqun Fang served as Beijing Municipal Government expert advisor, and was appointed to be the professor in Beijing Institute of Technology. In 1988, Beijing Municipal People's Government awarded him as Beijing outstanding contributions of expert. In the same year, Chinese National Science and Technology Commission recognized him as Chinese National Distinguished Scientist.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an open quantum system of N not directly interacting spins (qubits) {{in contact with}} both local and collective <b>thermal</b> <b>environments.</b> The qubit-environment interactions are energy conserving.

Our results demonstrate that the two-qubit entanglement generally decreases as N in-creases. We show analytically that in the limit N → ∞, no entanglement can be created. This indicates that collective <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> cannot create two-qubit entanglement when many qubits are located within a region of the size of the environment coherence length.

40|$|The {{preferential}} {{synthesis of}} heat shock proteins (Hsps) {{in response to}} thermal stress [the heat shock response (HSR) ] {{has been shown to}} vary in species that occupy different <b>thermal</b> <b>environments.</b> A survey of case studies of aquatic (mostly marine) organisms occupying stable <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> at all latitudes, from polar to tropical, shows that they do not in general respond to heat stress with an inducible HSR. Organisms that occupy highly variable <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> (variations up to 3 ̆e 20 °C), like the intertidal zone, induce the HSR frequently and within the range of body temperatures they normally experience, suggesting that the response is part of their biochemical strategy to occupy this thermal niche. The highest temperatures at which these organisms can synthesize Hsps are only a few degrees Celsius higher than the highest body temperatures they experience. Thus, they live close to their thermal limits and any further increase in temperature is probably going to push them beyond those limits.

Based on the above, an EFEM (energy finite element method) based approximate approach for the energy analysis of coupled plates under nonuniform <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> is proposed. The approach could be conducted by three steps: (1) thermal analysis, (2) thermal stress analysis, and (3) forming element matrixes, joint matrixes, and the whole EFEM formulation for the energy analysis. The same mesh model is used for all the three steps. The comparison between EFEM results and classical modal superposition method results of simply supported plates in various uniform <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> and coupled plates in nonuniform <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> demonstrated that the derived energy governing equation and the proposed approach described well the smooth time- and locally space-averaged energy density.

The phages were actively produced, with a population turnover time of 1 to 2 days. Phage-mediated microbial mortality was significant, making phage lysis {{an important component of}} hot spring microbial food webs.

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCM) may {{be useful}} for spacecraft thermal control systems that involve cyclical heat loads or cyclical <b>thermal</b> <b>environments.</b> <b>Thermal</b> energy {{can be stored in}} the PCM during peak heat loads or in adverse <b>thermal</b> <b>environments.</b> The stored <b>thermal</b> energy can then be released later during minimum heat loads or in more favorable <b>thermal</b> <b>environments.</b> This can result in a decreased turndown ratio for the radiator and a reduced system mass. The use of water as a PCM rather than the more traditional paraffin wax has the potential for significant mass reduction since the latent heat of formation of water is approximately 70 % greater than that of wax. One of the potential drawbacks of using ice as a PCM is its potential to rupture its container as water expands upon freezing. In order to develop a space qualified ice PCM heat exchanger, failure mechanisms must first be understood. Therefore, a methodical experimental investigation has been undertaken to demonstrate and document specific failure mechanisms due to ice expansion in the PCM. A number of ice PCM heat exchangers were fabricated and tested. Additionally, methods for controlling void location {{in order to reduce the}} risk of damage due to ice expansion were investigated.

40|$|Abstract: Dry snow {{metamorphism}} {{has traditionally}} been classified by the thermal gradient encountered in the snowpack. Snow experiencing a predominantly equi-temperature environment develops different microstructure than snow that is subjected to a temperature gradient. As such, previous research has evaluated snow metamorphism based upon select thermal gradient dependent processes, when in reality, there is a continuum of physical processes simultaneously contributing to metamorphism. In previous research, a discrete temperature gradient transition between the two <b>thermal</b> <b>environments</b> {{has been used to}} activate separate morphological analyses. The cUrrent research focuses on a unifying approach to dry snow metamorphism that is applicable to generalized <b>thermal</b> <b>environments.</b> The movement ofheat and mass is not prescribed, but is allowed to develop naturally through modeling of physical processes. Equi-temperature, transition to kinetic growth, and kinetic growth are considered with this model. Density, grain size, bond size, and temperature dependencies are each examined in an equi-temperature metamorphism environment. The same physical model is then used to defme a smooth transition between equi-temperature and temperature gradient environments. Microstructural and environmental parameters that influence the transition to kinetic growth are examined. The correlation with established trends and experiments in each environment is excellent. The microstructural model is a new tool capable of evaluating metamorphism for a broad range ofmicrostructural parameters and <b>thermal</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
