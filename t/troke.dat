This was despite being an undischarged bankrupt. He had formed a partnership with his son, Charles Henry Churchill, and in 1888 he obtained another partner when John William Wright Gabriel disposed of his family's interest in a drugs manufacturer, Gabriel and <b>Troke,</b> and joined the Churchills. This partnership may explain how {{he was able to}} complete the work in Birmingham despite his financial status. Despite the assertion by biographer David Jeremy that J W W Gabriel disposed of the drugs manufacturing interest, a notice in The London Gazette for 1885 shows his father, John Wild Gabriel, ending a partnership with <b>Troke,</b> and that <b>Troke</b> then formed a similar arrangement with another person.|$|E

[...] Huth's insights into {{the workings of the}} Nazi bureaucratic mentality were in evidence when he planned and created a new identity for Ludwig von Hammerstein, taking care to ensure that the false identity provided should state that he was born into an expatriate German family in South America. The idea was to reduce the risk that the authorities might be induced by inadvertent nonconformist actions to investigate the identity more closely. Foreign born Germans might be expected not to have grown up with precisely the same social ground rules as German born Germans.

6000|$|Mr. Greenwood again expresses {{his views}} about this dark {{suspicious}} mystery, {{the absence of}} Shakespeare or Shakspere (or Shak, as you like it), from Henslowe's accounts, if Shak(&c.) wrote plays. But the mystery, if mystery there be, is just as obscure if the actor were the channel through which Bacon's plays reached the stage, for the pretended author of these masterpieces. Shak--was not the man {{to do all the}} <b>troking,</b> bargaining, lying, going here and there, and making himself a motley to the view for 0 pounds, 0s, 0d. If he were a sham, a figure-head, a liar, a fetcher-and-carrier of manuscripts, HE WOULD BE PAID FOR IT. But he did not deal with Henslowe in his bargainings, and THAT is why Henslowe does not mention him. Mr. Greenwood, in one place, {161a} agrees, so far, with me. [...] "Why did Henslowe not mention Shakespeare as the writer of other plays" [...] (than Titus Andronicus and Henry VI)? [...] "I think the answer is simple enough." [...] (So do I.) [...] "Neither Shakspere nor 'Shakespeare' ever wrote for Henslowe!" [...] The obvious is perceived at last; and the reason given is [...] "that he was above Henslowe's 'skyline,'" [...] "he" [...] being the Author. We only differ as to WHY the author was above Henslowe's [...] "sky-line." [...] I say, because good Will had a better market, that of his Company. I understand Mr. Greenwood to think,--because the Great Unknown was too great a man to deal with Henslowe. If to write for the stage were discreditable, to deal (unknown) with Henslowe was no more disgraceful than to deal with [...] "a cry of players"; and as (unknown) Will did the bargaining, the Great Unknown was as safe with Will in one case as in the other. If Will did not receive anything for the plays from his own company (who firmly believed in his authorship), they must have said, [...] "Will! dost thou serve the Muses and thy obliged fellows for naught? Dost thou give us two popular plays yearly,--gratis?" ...|$|R
40|$|Juro Kubicek (Görlitz in 1908 – in 1970 Berlin) was {{a painter}} and {{designer}} of the post-war years in Berlin and had exhibitions at the Gallery Rosen. As an autodidact he developed a personal painting style with an infinite, metamorphosing line. As the first German Artist-in-Residence after the World War II Kubicek taught at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, USA from 1947 - 49. He {{was one of the}} first German post-war artists who painted in an all-over-manner and in 1953 exhibited at the zimmergalerie in Frankfurt am Main. He worked at the Amerika-Haus in Berlin and in 1954 first became lecturer, later professor at the college for pedagogic arts (HfbK) in Berlin. The thesis devotes itself to Kubicek’s creative urge, his joy of new materials and varying styles, his engagement as a teacher and organizer and his meaning for the development of cultural life in Berlin. His life gives a glimpse of the post-war years, the work of the occupation authorities and private sponsorships, the renewed formulation of Surrealism and the aesthetics of the Weimar Bauhaus 1945 in Berlin and provides information about the development of Informal painting in Germany, as well as an introduction into colour field painting. Revealed is Kubicek’s symbolic painting manner of the 40 ies, the gestural painting process of the 50 ies and to the organic colour fields of the 60 ies. Common to his works are a magic-meditative, harmonious-lyrical form of expression which the viewer has to decipher and discover. His palette is rather of a chill and covered colour combination which can occasionally light up, but always will be well-balanced in the picture square. His realistic sceneries become increasingly a two-dimensional line tangle and then change to open drip-colour surfaces. Only bit by bit he develops his very own forms, space and depth reappear with abstract techniques, he cites and combines his styles, materials and forms, easily combines his soft endless line in the late 60 s years with colour field painting. His often puzzling techniques which proves a masterly understanding of materials and surfaces is connected with an exact and clean implementation. Even where a picture seems torn or experimental, it is based on a planned, controlled action. Kubicek formulated in 1945 : „ I strive for law and order in colour, in space, work of the intellect in paint“ - which explains the clarity of his compositions. The Russian cultural officer Alexander Dymschitz in his infamous article about Formalism in 1948 compared Juro Kubicek’s work in a negative fashion with that of Pablo Picasso and Karl Hofer. These comparisons may be a little far fetched, but from the perspective of the art historians Juro Kubicek’s painting should be placed among that of his peers and friends in Berlin, like Heinz <b>Trökes,</b> Hans Thiemann, Hannah Höch or Jeanne Mammen...|$|R

5000|$|As a hamlet, Moordown enjoyed [...] "a {{reputation}} for roughness" [...] throughout the nineteenth century; as one inhabitant recalled, [...] "it {{was not an}} uncommon thing for a policeman to be hit over the head at night by a gang of roughs". A typical incident occurred in 1851, when a police officer was assaulted by [...] "an uncivilized set of beings", namely a gang of eight Moordown reprobates. Among them was the notorious Solomon <b>Troke</b> (c. 1831-1920), also known as Solomon Head, who received his first poaching conviction when he was fifteen, and had notched up a further thirteen convictions by 1864. Incredibly, he later became a gamekeeper - patrolling the Haddon Hill estate in the Queen's Park district of Bournemouth, and being awarded a gun by his appreciative employer, James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury. Ultimately he retired to Moordown, living out his last years in quiet respectability at 14 Nursery Road.|$|E
5000|$|The {{death of}} Joshua ben Levi in {{particular}} is surrounded with a web of fable. When the time came for him to die and the Angel of Death appeared to him, he demanded to be shown his place in paradise. When the angel had consented to this, he demanded the angel's knife, that the angel might not frighten him by the way. This request also was granted him, and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise; the angel, who {{is not allowed to}} enter paradise, caught hold of the end of his garment. Joshua swore that he would not come out, and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he was absolved from his oath; if not absolved, he was to remain. The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife, but Joshua refused. At this point, a heavenly voice (bat ḳol) rang out: [...] "Give him back the knife, because the children of men have need of it will bring death." [...] Hesitant, Joshua Ben Levi gives back the knife in exchange for the Angel of Deaths name. To never forget the name he carved <b>Troke</b> into his arm the Angel of Death's chosen name. When the knife was returned to the Angel Joshua's carving of the name faded and he forgot.(Ket. 77b; Jellinek, l.c. ii. 48-51; Bacher, l.c. i. 192 et seq.).|$|E
