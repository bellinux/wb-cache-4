50|$|Models 73, 106, 126, 107, 127, and 147, {{the last}} {{generation}} of Cub Cadets to utilize the narrow frame, composed {{the next generation of}} Cub Cadets. The model 73 still contained the seven horsepower Kohler engine, three speed direct drive <b>transmission,</b> <b>pan</b> seat, and optional round fenders. The Cub Cadet 106, which replaced the model 104, had a ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three speed transmission, while the model 126 which replaced the model 124, had a twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a three speed direct drive transmission. The ten horsepower model 107 and the twelve horsepower model 127 were hydrostatic units which replaced the models 105 and 125. The model 147 was unique {{because it was the first}} model of Cub Cadet to utilize a fourteen-horsepower Kohler engine. The flywheel on this engine was so large, International had to widen the frame next to the flywheel so the engine would fit between the rails. The model 147 was also unique because it was equipped with electric lift. Electric lift used an electric motor to raise and lower implements with the movement of a switch. The most noteworthy style change in these Cub Cadet models were the wider square fenders. These are the same fenders that were standard on all the following Cub Cadet models International made and some of the early models MTD made. These models were produced from 1969 to 1971.|$|E
5000|$|The THM400 can be {{visually}} {{identified by}} an oil pan number four shown at General Motors <b>Transmission</b> <b>Pans.</b> First introduced for the 1964 model year {{under the name}} [...] "Turbo Hydra-Matic" [...] in Cadillacs and [...] "Super Turbine" [...] in Buicks. The following year, application expanded to Oldsmobile and Pontiac and to some full-sized Chevrolets. Many of the Buick, Cadillac, and Oldsmobile THM400s produced between 1964-67 were equipped with a [...] "Switch-Pitch" [...] torque converter with a variable-pitch stator, which is sought after by collectors and drag racers. These can be identified outside the vehicle (with the torque converter removed) by a narrow front pump spline. Externally the switch pitch version has two electrical connections, where the non-switch pitch THM400 has only one. GM used a Switch Pitch torque converter in the Buick twin turbine Dynaflow transmission between 1955-1963 and the Super Turbine 300 two speed transmissions used by Oldsmobile Pontiac, and Buick divisions between 1964-1967. This transmission (among other THMs) is identified by the [...] "Park R N D L2 L1" [...] selector quadrant.|$|R

50|$|The next Cub Cadet {{models that}} International {{introduced}} were the models 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125. The model 72 {{was a direct}} replacement for the model 71 which used the seven-horsepower Kohler engine, three-speed direct drive <b>transmission,</b> and <b>pan</b> seat. The model 104 replaced the model 102 using the ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed transmission. The model 124 replaced the model 122 using the twelve horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed direct drive transmission. The model 125 replaced the model 123 using the twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a hydrostatic transmission. The model 105 was the first Cub Cadet to offer a ten-horsepower Kohler motor with a hydrostatic transmission. These Cub Cadet models retained the same square fenders as the previous models. The biggest difference in these Cub Cadets was their fiberglass dash which contained an ammeter. The production of the 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125 ran from 1967 to 1969.|$|R

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{an application of}} Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve <b>Transmission</b> Network <b>Panning</b> (TNP). The non-convexity that has been observed in the Transmission Network Planning cannot be solved effectively by conventional mathematical methods. GA {{has the ability to}} find the global optimal point in such a nonconvex function. It is recognized that the allocation of transmission costs in a competitive environment requires careful evaluation of alternative transmission network plans. As a result, the need for methods that are able to synthesize optimal transmission network plans has become more important than ever. Unfortunately, practice has shown that conventional optimization procedures are unable to produce optimal solutions for networks. The reason is that the transmission network planning problem is hard, large-scale combinatorial problem. The number of options to be analyzed increases exponentially with the size of the network. The objective of TNP is to determine the installation plans of new facilities (lines & other network equipment) so that the resulting bulk power system may be able, to meet the forecasted demand at the lowest cost, while satisfying prescribed technical, financial and reliability criteria. Although the conventional methods are somewhat successful in transmission network planning, some problems still exist: 1) Non-convexity (as described above) : Therefore, the optimization process sometimes stops at non-optimal solutions. 2) Non-linearity: increases the iterations of the optimization algorithm and sometimes causes divergence. As there are no fractional transmission lines, transmission network planning becomes a very complex mixed integer non-linear programming problem. GA can be used to select the optimal new transmission lines network with the least investment cost, while meeting the total load demands without any load curtailment. The project done under the "Transmission Network Planning using Genetic Algorithm" has been successfully completed giving good results for the particular transmission network...|$|R
