5000|$|... mm'-type filters, {{also called}} double-m-derived filters, are {{a type of}} {{electronic}} filter designed using the image method. They were patented by Otto Zobel in 1932. Like the m-type filter from which it is derived, the mm'-type filter type was intended to provide an improved impedance match into the filter termination impedances and originally arose in connection with <b>telephone</b> <b>frequency</b> division multiplexing. The filter has a similar transfer function to the m-type, having the same advantage of rapid cut-off, but the input impedance remains much more nearly constant if suitable parameters are chosen. In fact, the cut-off performance is better for the mm'-type if like-for-like impedance matching are compared rather than like-for-like transfer function. It also has the same drawback of a rising response in the stopband as the m-type. However, its main disadvantage is its much increased complexity which is the chief reason its use never became widespread. It was only ever intended {{to be used as}} the end sections of composite filters, the rest of the filter being made up of other sections such as k-type and m-type sections.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an evolutionary approach (genetic algorithm) to allocate frequencies in {{the cells of}} cellular network. In cellular telephone system, each cellular area is divided into small regions called cells. Each cell uses {{a unique set of}} frequencies. There is limited frequency so the frequency needs to be reuse. The Frequency allocation problem states that given any area separated into cells are allocated frequencies {{in such a way that}} no neighbor cells could have the same frequency [...] . Since the problem looks very simple but as the number of cells is increased it becomes very complex and becomes NP-Complete problem. To find the solution of this problem, we have explored the use of genetic algorithm where possible solutions are improved generation by generation and there is more probability to find the exact solution [...] Fitness function is developed which is the backbone of the concept of genetic algorithm and directly affects the performance; since this is NP problem and traditional heuristics have had only limited success in solving small to mid size problems. In this paper we have tried to show that genetic algorithm is an alternative solution for this NP problem where conventional deterministic methods are not able to provide the optimal solution.

One of the main goals of follow-up {{is to improve the}} survival of patients. Follow-up influences survival by detecting local recurrences and second primary tumors in an early stage, thereby reducing the risk of metastases. Breast cancer occurs in about one in eight women in the Netherlands. Every year, 11000 new cases are registered and about 3500 women die of breast cancer. Prognosis after primary treatment for patients with breast cancer is improving. This leads to an increased number of patients in follow-up, which leads to increased workload. All patients are currently assigned the same follow-up: five years long, with a frequency of two consults per year, as national guidelines prescribe. This study wants to determine a more individualized follow-up in order to give women the follow-up they need and reduce workload in hospitals.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{characterized}} the path loss properties in industrial environments. However {{most of them}} have focused on one frequency, and some two or maximum three <b>frequencies,</b> usually cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>frequencies</b> or the unlicensed ISM bands that are commonly used in various industries. Few, if any, have characterized a larger part of the useable frequency range. This thesis is taking that challenge and investigates the path loss characteristics over a large frequency range, 300 MHz – 3 GHz, in industrial environments. First a measurement system suitable for the harsh environments found in industries is designed and verified. The measurement system is designed as two asynchronous stand-alone units that can be positioned at an arbitrary position to measure the path loss characteristics in any environment without interfering with the normal activities at the location. After that a measurement campaign involving three different types of environments is carried out. The environment types are: first, one highly absorbing – a paper warehouse at a paper mill; second, one highly reflective – a furnace building filled with metal objects and constructions and third, a mine tunnel – located 1 km below the surface of earth which is neither highly reflective nor absorbing but exhibits somewhat wave-guide like characteristics. The environments are shown to have very different behavior when it comes to propagation characteristics. Observations in the first environment reveal an environment that almost cancels out certain frequency bands and only line-of-sight communication is possible, hence no improvement will be achieved if installing systems that take multipath propagation into account, like MIMO. In the second environment reflections are legion; there are so many reflecting surfaces at different angles so any polarization of the signal is almost completely eliminated. Large fading variations were observed. The third environment is the underground mine where signals propagate inside the tunnels like in waveguides. It is shown that there are regions in the spectrum where the path loss dips and that these dips at least partly can be modeled with a simple two-beam propagation model normally used for outdoor propagation over infinite fields. The overall conclusion is that industrial environments are more heterogeneous regarding propagation characteristics than commonly assumed when selecting communication solutions. And {{that the only way to}} really know if a radio system will work at a certain location is to measure and characterize the environment...|$|R

To {{evaluate}} parents’ {{beliefs and}} practices related to childhood obesity and determine if these are influenced by parent’s perception of their own weight or their child’s weight. Methods. Parents of obese (n= 689) or normal weight (n= 1122) children 4 – 15 years in Georgia, USA, were randomly selected to complete a <b>telephone</b> survey. <b>Frequency</b> of child obesity-related perceptions, beliefs, and practices were assessed, stratified by parent-perceived self-weight and child weight status, and compared using Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression. Results. Most parents, regardless of perceived child weight, agreed that child overweight/obesity can cause serious illness (95 %) but only one-half believed {{it was a problem}} in Georgia. Many (42. 4 %) failed to recognize obesity in their own children. More parents who perceived their child as overweight versus normal weight reported concern about their child’s diet and activity and indicated readiness for lifestyle change. Parents’ perception of their own weight had little additional impact. Conclusions. While awareness of child overweight as a modifiable health risk is high, many parents fail to recognize it in their own families and communities, reducing the likelihood of positive lifestyle change.
