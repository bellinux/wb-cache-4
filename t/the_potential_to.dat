5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E

5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of the Central American bark scorpion, Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide selectively inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels. Patented by Merck, it has <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> prevent neointimal hyperplasia, a common cause of bypass graft failure.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> {{transfer}} {{equally well}} between chemically similar systems, according to well-defined, physically motivated rules involving ion radii and polarizabilities were shown.

5|$|Carbenes that {{formally}} {{derive from}} imidazole-2-ylidenes by substitution of sulfur, oxygen, or other chalcogens for both α-nitrogens {{are expected to}} be unstable, as they have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> dissociate into an alkyne (R1C≡CR2) and a carbon dichalcogenide (X1=C=X2).|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, with <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators.
