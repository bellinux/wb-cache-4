5|$|Several {{species of}} crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are {{appealing}} when young, and pet-store owners can easily sell them, but crocodilians {{do not make}} good pets; <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Snowflakes {{nucleate}} around mineral or organic {{particles in}} moisture-saturated, subfreezing air masses. <b>They</b> <b>grow</b> by net accretion to the incipient crystals in hexagonal formations. The cohesive forces are primarily electrostatic.|$|E
5|$|Successful birch {{cultivation}} {{requires a}} climate cool enough {{for at least}} the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they may require water during dry periods. <b>They</b> <b>grow</b> best in full sun planted in deep, well-drained soil.|$|E
60|$|The boys grew fast. In {{every day}} <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> a year's growth, {{and in every}} night another year's growth, but at dawn, when the stars were fading, <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> three years' growth in the {{twinkling}} of an eye. And <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> in other things besides height, too. Thrice in age, and thrice in wisdom, and thrice in knowledge. And when three days and three nights had passed they were twelve years in age, twenty-four in strength, and thirty-six in wisdom.|$|R

50|$|Being {{in touch}} with the poor and the oppressed gave the SLW a growing {{awareness}} of our kinship with all of creation. As <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> in reverence for the Living Word, <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> also in appreciation of all creation as an expression of that Word. The Stewardship Statement, adopted unanimously in 1984, is testimony to this stance.|$|R
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{have many}} other uses. They {{are used for}} human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines. In {{addition}} to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in herbal medicine. The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this way has spread from the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where <b>they</b> <b>grow,</b> such as India.|$|E

5|$|Corals are shallow, colonial {{organisms that}} {{integrate}} δ18O and trace elements into their skeletal aragonite (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as <b>they</b> <b>grow.</b> Geochemistry anomalies within the crystalline structures of corals represent functions of temperature, salinity and oxygen isotopic composition. Such geochemical analysis {{can help with}} climate modeling.|$|E
5|$|Gentlemen may tither, and tither, and tither, and {{may think}} it a bad measure; but their heads at present are hot, and will so remain till <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> cool again, {{and so they}} can't decide right now, but when the day of {{judgement}} comes then honourable gentlemen will be satisfied with this most excellent union.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E

5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the {{goodness}} and flavour {{of the fruit}} proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which <b>they</b> <b>grow.</b> We are nothing but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, {{and the nature of}} our employment.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{are also}} {{released}} spontaneously {{in the absence}} of fire. The degree to which B.serrata trees exhibit bradyspory seems to depend {{on the nature of the}} site where <b>they</b> <b>grow.</b> One study recorded plants at coastal sites having more than 30% of their follicles open, compared to those further inland having fewer than 5% open. Follicles also open when part of the tree dies.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, {{the species}} has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as <b>they</b> <b>grow.</b> In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils in which <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used this plant as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but {{reported to be}} very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens as <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> older and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> larger.|$|E
