[...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E

We had enough material for {{one and a}} half LPs, so we figured let's put out a double and use some of the material we had done previously but never released. It seemed like a good <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing, release tracks like [...] "Boogie With Stu" [...] which we normally wouldn't be able to do... his time we figured it was better to stretch out than to leave off." ...|$|E

[...] When questioned {{about the possibility of}} a follow-up album in November 2010, band member Timothy B. Schmit said, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again. I wouldn't close the door on it, but I don't know." [...] In a 2010 {{interview with}} undercover.fm, Joe Walsh said that the band might be able to make one more album before the band [...] "wraps it up".|$|E

50|$|In analog TV, {{originally}} it was {{too costly}} to create a simple sequential raster scan of the type just described with a fast-enough refresh rate and sufficient horizontal resolution, although the French 819-line system had better definition than other standards of its <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> obtain a flicker-free display, analog TV used {{a variant of the}} scheme in moving-picture film projectors, in which each frame of the film is shown twice or three <b>times.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> the shutter closes and opens again to increase the flicker rate, but not the data update rate.|$|R

2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus". In 2002, he commented on the experience: [...] "In the studio, {{it would take me}} typically 3 weeks to finish a Trance To The Sun song; and in that 3 week period I would spend anywhere from 80 to 180 hours. I kind of logged my studio <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> kind of studio work by yourself, you have to take careful notes. And on the last Trance To The Sun album there's a song called [...] "Map of the Lost" [...] which set the all time record at 180 hours. [...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with. The reason it took so long is because it went through several mutilations before reaching a final stage." ...|$|E

But he had not the heart to tell his wife what he had done, and he sat taciturn that whole evening, without even going over his accounts, and went early to bed, where he lay tossing half the night before he fell asleep. He slept at last only upon the promise he made himself that he would {{withdraw}} the house from the broker's hands; but he went heavily to his own business in the morning without doing so.

60|$|So {{his soul}} and her {{happiness}} {{were in the}} balance weighed against a woman's power. It seemed to Lenore that she felt hopelessly unable to carry the issue to victory; and yet, on the other hand, a tumultuous and wonderful sweetness of sensation called to her, insidiously, of the infallible potency of love. What could she do to save Dorn's life and his soul? There was only one answer to that. She would do anything. She must make him love her {{to the extent that}} he would have no will to carry out this desperate intent. There was little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The gradual growth of affection through intimacy and understanding was not possible here. It must come as a flash of lightning.

But you can't expect the water to come to that hole just the very day it's finished.

30|$|Our {{objective}} in this note {{is to determine}} closed form solutions of rotational motion of fractional Maxwell fluid in an infinite circular pipe that applies a couple to the fluid which is <b>time</b> dependent. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> contrary <b>to</b> the usual rule from the literature, we use the constitutive equation for the tangential stress, {{which is the result}} of elimination of velocity field between the constitutive equations and relevant motion of fluid. The solutions for the current flow model that have been achieved fulfill all imposed initial and boundary conditions. Solutions for Newtonian and ordinary Maxwell fluids having similar motion are also obtained as limiting cases. Finally, the effect of fractional parameter and relaxation time on the velocity and shear stress fields as well as some comparisons with ordinary Maxwell and Newtonian fluids are graphically underlined and discussed.|$|R
