30|$|In this paper, high {{wage growth}} in the Turkish economy has been {{analyzed}} by considering workdays lost <b>to</b> <b>strikes,</b> inflation and real GDP growth. To determine the real dynamics behind wage growth, the VAR analysis was implemented by deriving data from variables between 1963 and 2015.

In consequence, workdays lost <b>to</b> <b>strikes</b> and inflation were seen to be the key factors in wage growth. As the analysis shows, industrial actions have been influential in Turkey, usually entailing wage demands in excess of the inflation rate.|$|R
