5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E

2500|$|In Portland cement clinker, calcium aluminoferrite {{occurs as}} an [...] "interstitial phase", {{crystallizing}} from the melt.

5000|$|A {{ferrite core}} or bead {{can be added}} to an {{inductor}} to improve, in two ways, its ability to block unwanted high frequency noise. First, <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> concentrates the magnetic field, increases inductance and therefore reactance, which impedes or ‘filters out’ the noise. Second, if <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> is so designed, it can produce an additional loss in the form of resistance in <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> itself. <b>The</b> <b>ferrite</b> creates an inductor with a very low Q factor.

50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a {{resonance}} absorption isolator, but the magnetic biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> block rather than within <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal, while the backward signal sees <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the forward signal tends to be excluded from <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film.

50|$|To achieve non-reciprocity, an {{isolator}} must necessarily {{incorporate a}} non-reciprocal material. At microwave frequencies {{this material is}} invariably a ferrite which is biased by a static magnetic field. <b>The</b> <b>ferrite</b> is positioned within the isolator such that the microwave signal presents it with a rotating magnetic field, with the rotation axis aligned with {{the direction of the}} static bias field. The behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> depends on the sense of rotation with respect to the bias field, and hence is different for microwave signals travelling in opposite directions. Depending on the exact operating conditions, the signal travelling in one direction may either be phase-shifted, displaced from <b>the</b> <b>ferrite</b> or absorbed.|$|E

The core is usually made of ferrite, a ceramic material containing iron oxide and other metals.
