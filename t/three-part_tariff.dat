40|$|In many service industries, firms {{introduce}} three-part tariffs {{to replace}} or complement existing two-part tariffs. While both two- and three-part tariffs {{have been studied}} in the extant literature, to our best knowledge {{there have been no}} empirical studies of customer choice and usage when both types of tariffs are on offer. A pertinent question in that context is whether <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> usage can be well predicted based on observed behavior on two-part tariffs. Given a unique data set from a mobile telephony operator, we investigate customer switching between two- and threepart tariffs as well as customers ’ usage behavior under the two types of tariffs. We find empirically that customers who switched to a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> significantly “over-use ” compared to their prior two-part tariff usage and attain a level of consumption that cannot be explained by a simple shift in the budget constraint or an explanation based on substitution between different types of calls. To account for this change in level of usage, we propose that the inclusive, or “free”, minutes of a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> introduces an additional attribute that is valued by the customer in her choice and usage decisions.

This approach allows us to explicitly calculate the optimal <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> plan under quite general conditions, where consumers are rational, they have a general utility function, they experience psychological costs when they exceed the number of free units, they have deterministic or stochastic consumption rates, they are homogeneous or heterogeneous, and the firm costs are fixed or depend on the usage level...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of the Internet {{creates a}} need to manage traffic while preserving equal treatment of content. We estimate demand for residential broadband, using high-frequency data from subscribers facing a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff,</b> and use the estimates to study the welfare implications of usage-based pricing, a commonly offered solution to network congestion. The <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> makes data usage during the billing cycle a dynamic problem; thus, generating variation in the (shadow) price of usage during the month. We provide evidence that subscribers respond to this variation, and use their dynamic decisions to estimate a flexible distribution of willingness to pay for different plan characteristics. Using these estimates, we show that usage-based pricing eliminates low-value traffic and improves overall welfare. Usage-based pricing might decrease consumer surplus, depending on what alternative is considered. Furthermore, we show that {{the costs associated with}} investment in fiber-optic networks (an alternative proposed to deal with congestion) are likely recoverable in some markets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets up a}} {{microeconomics}} {{model to}} analyze the market outcomes of two-part <b>tariffs</b> and <b>three-part</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Specifically, this paper compare the market outcomes of a single two-part tariffs to a single <b>three-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> under the assumptions that the market structure is monopolistic, there is no demand uncertainty, and demand curve is a linear straight line. The results show that a single two-part tariffs and a single <b>three-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> bring forth the same market outcomes except lump-sum fees. The lump-sum fees of the <b>three-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> are the lump-sum fees of the two-part tariffs plus the revenue loss caused by an allowance (free volume provided to customers). Therefore, according to this result, the monopolist {{has no reason to}} prefer <b>three-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> to two-part tariffs.

I show that, compared with linear pricing equilibrium and two-part tariff equilibrium, a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> always strictly increases the dominant firm's (the leader's) profit when competing against a rival (the follower) with substitute products, in the absence of usual price discrimination motive. The competitive effect of a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> in contrast to linear pricing depends on the degree of substitutability between products: Competition is intensified when two products are more differentiated, yet softened when two products are more substitutable. This is in stark contrast with the competitive scenario posed by a two-part tariff: A two-part tariff always enhances competition and gives the highest total surplus of these three pricing schemes. My findings offer a new perspective on three-part tariffs, a perspective which could help antitrust enforcement agencies distinguish the exclusionary <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> from the pro-competitive one.; The second essay extends the traditional literature on bundling and the burgeoning literature on two-sided markets by presenting a theoretical monopoly model of mixed bundling {{in the context of the}} portable video game console market [...] a prototypical two-sided market.

In our setting, mixed bundling acts as a price discrimination tool segmenting the market more efficiently as well as functions as a coordination device helping solve "the chicken or the egg" problem in two-sided markets.

A <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> is defined by an access price, a usage allowance, and a marginal price for any usage {{in excess of the}} allowance.

By allowing consumers to switch from their current provider to a competitor, we model behavior in competitive industries. Our results show that demand uncertainty is a key driver of choice between three-part tariffs. For a given tariff and average usage, the expected bill increases with the variation in consumer demand, steering consumers towards tariffs with high usage allowances. Consequently, demand uncertainty decreases consumer surplus and increases provider revenue. In addition, we analyze consumers’ responsiveness to the different elements of a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff.</b> We find that the access price is the main driver of consumer tariff choice, whose effects dominate any sensitivity to the usage price or the allowance.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the pricing}} policies used by operators when they establish broadband tariffs. The studies draw on datasets that combine broadband plans’ characteristics and tariffs with {{other sources of}} data at country level to reflect the market structure and regulation activity. The pricing models in this dissertation share the common thread of using three groups of variables to explain the level of broadband prices: 1 - {{the characteristics of the}} broadband service, 2 - the operators’ commercial strategies, and 3 - the market structure and regulatory policies implemented. The pricing models are estimated using the following econometric techniques: pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) with country and time fixed effects, and two stage least squares (2 SLS, instrumental variable techniques). The level of broadband prices concerns both national governments and international organisations, and this dissertation contributes to provide some guidance to regulators and competition authorities, helping them in the implementation of policies so as to foster competition in the market and ultimately stimulate the diffusion of broadband services. The first thesis chapter analyses the determinants of broadband Internet access prices in a group of 15 EU countries between 2008 and 2011. Using a rich panel data set of broadband plans, it is shown how downstream speed (Mbps) increases prices, and that the price per Mbps of cable modem and ﬁbre technologies is lower than that of xDSL. Operators’ marketing strategies are also analysed as it is shown how much prices rise when the broadband service is offered in a bundle with voice telephony and/or television, and how much they fall when download volume caps are included. The most insightful results of this study are provided by a group of metrics that represent the situation of competition and entry patterns in the broadband market. It is found that consumer segmentation positively affects prices. Moreover, broadband prices are higher in countries where entrants make greater use of bitstream access and lower in countries where there is an intensive use of direct access (local loop unbundling). However, there is not a signiﬁcant impact of inter-platform competition on prices. The second chapter analyses the strategies adopted by mobile operators when they set the prices of broadband plans. It is explained that operators design multi-tier price schemes in order to segment consumers according to their preferences. Operators usually offer only a few unlimited usage contracts and <b>three-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> for data limited plans. In the later case, the tariff includes an access fee, a usage allowance (the number of GB that consumers can use for free), and a penalty system for the case in which consumers exceed the contracted allowance. The empirical model shows that the prices of usage based contracts are lower than those of unlimited contracts, and that the monthly price depends on the type of penalty included in the plan. The prices also depend on other characteristics of the service such as the provided technology, the download speed and the telephone call allowances. It is also explained that most plans bundle mobile broadband plans with smartphones. This type of plans last longer and might be more expensive than the plans that only include the SIM card. Specifically, it is shown that the monthly price of the broadband service is more expensive when the plan includes an iPhone or a Samsung. Moreover, it is found that the monthly prices are higher when the plan includes a discount for the acquisition of the smarthphone. Finally, this chapter also studies the effects of market structure and entry regulation on prices and shows that mobile virtual operators have helped to reduce prices. The third chapter studies the mobile broadband market in Spain. The mobile broadband service has experienced a strong expansion in Spain, reaching a penetration of over 70 % of the population at the beginning of 2014. This growth {{can be explained by the}} benefits that offer the third and the fourth generation of mobile technology, and by the continuous price reductions. In spite of this, prices in Spain are still higher than the European average. This chapter explains the process of technological innovation that has allowed the emergence of mobile broadband, and its launch in Spain. New commercial strategies used by mobile operators, such as bundling and plans that include fixed and mobile services are examined. The analysis shows that the presence of mobile virtual network operators and bundling have been effective in fostering competition and reducing prices. It is also discussed how technological convergence between fixed and mobile services has promoted restructuring and market concentration...|$|R

30|$|The {{papers that}} are most related to ours, but do not address the cost cap tariff, are Lambrecht et al. (2007) and Iyengar et al. (2008). More specifically, Lambrecht et al. (2007) develop an {{empirical}} model for uncertainty under three-part tariffs (consisting of a fixed fee, a usage allowance, and pay-per-use price for the usage that exceeds the allowance) by incorporating future usage shocks occurring prior to the consumption decision in the tariff choice stage. Within their model, uncertainty is a key driver for <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> choice. Iyengar et al. (2008) derive the optimal consumption level for three-part tariffs under certainty first, and then allow for small variations of this level ex post. Thereby, both papers propose a similar consumer surplus model with the intention in mind to explain observed tariff choice by estimating the models’ underlying parameters. Schlereth and Skiera (2012) demonstrated that such models can be also used to predict tariff choice of innovative tariffs. The predictions of these models are, therefore, {{the result of a}} choice model that has been calibrated by actual tariff decisions, including consumers’ biases and irrationalities.|$|E

Furthermore, after adoption, customers who exceed their allowances and consequently pay overage fees are more likely to switch to plans with larger allowances than customers who do not experience such fees. Notably, after switching, these overage-paying customers pay higher monthly payments than before. In contrast, switching customers who did not pay overage payments before switching pay less after switching. Our findings, unlike those of previous research on experience-based learning, suggest that the behavior of experienced customers does not converge to the predictions of neoclassical models. We propose that "overage aversion," which is closely related to loss aversion and mental accounting, is the most plausible explanation for our findings...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three chapters that focus on competition and regulation in the telecommunications industry. The first chapter investigates the main determinants of mobile service prices and evaluates the impact of market structure and regulations on retail prices. Both a simultaneous equations model and a reduced form model are estimated using a panel dataset for 36 countries over the period of 1999 - 2010. The market concentration of mobile network operators (MNOs) has a statistically significant effect on prices in the reduced form regression. The coefficients of regulatory variables, such as mobile number portability (MNP), mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and mobile termination rates (MTR), are not significant in both estimations, suggesting {{that it is hard}} to conclude that ex post regulations are effective in mature markets. Country-specific cost factors such as population density, interest rates and unit labor costs have positive impacts on prices. The second chapter examines the structure of the household expenditure on telecommunications services and their relationship with other existing expenditures in South Korea. To estimate the demand for telecommunications services, the linear approximate Almost Ideal Demand System is implemented. The short-run relationship is estimated using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) with first differenced series of data, and the long-run relationship is examined through a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Both empirical results suggest that the household demand for telecommunications services is income inelastic over the period of 1990. 1 Q to 2013. 2 Q while it becomes price elastic after 2006. The results also show that recent telecommunications services have a complementary relationship with public transportation and substitution relationship with cultural services and private education. The third chapter analyzes the optimal features of three-part tariffs in the presence of heterogeneous consumers for the monopoly case and the duopoly case. Under monopoly case, the low demand users consume at the allowance level while the high demand users consume above it. The marginal utilities of consumption for the low demand type and high demand type exceed marginal cost, and the lump sum fee extracts all the surplus of low demand type. Under duopoly, asymmetric equilibria do not exist and only a symmetric <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> can be achieved as an equilibrium where marginal utilities for all consumers equal marginal cost, confirming that a standard Bertrand outcome holds under the <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> with heterogeneous consumers...|$|E

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES Analysis of tariff choice We analyze whether customers ’ bills would have been lower on another than their chosen tariff at the time that three-part tariffs were introduced. Based on the three available usage periods prior to the <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> introduction, we compute the individual-level average usage and standard deviation. For simplicity, we exclude customers who have switched more than once as well as the 1. 1 % of customers who switched within these three months. To account for deviations from average usage due to random usage shocks, we then compute the bill for the usage level of [average usage +/ − 1 standard deviation] under the current tariff, and the bill for the average usage under each of the remaining tariffs. We conclude that a customer would have had a lower bill on a different tariff if the bill for their average usage on a tariff other than the chosen tariff was below the lower bound of the bill-interval that accounts for variation in usage on the chosen tariff.

40|$|In many service industries, firms {{introduce}} three-part tariffs {{to replace}} or complement existing two-part tariffs. In contrast with two-part tariffs, three-part tariffs offer allowances, or “free” {{units of the}} service. Behavioral {{research suggests that the}} attributes of a pricing plan may affect behavior beyond their direct cost implications. Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what might be expected from the change in their budget constraint. Nonlinear pricing research, however, has not considered such an effect. The authors examine a market in which three-part tariffs were introduced for the first time. They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for customers who switch from two-part to three-part tariffs. The findings show that switchers significantly “overuse” in comparison with their prior two-part tariff usage. That is, they attain a level of consumption that cannot be explained by a shift in the budget constraint. The authors estimate a discrete/continuous model of tariff choice and usage that accounts for the valuation of free units.

40|$|Purpose This paper investigates {{contracts}} of the {{intermodal transport}} {{market and the}} incentives they create for a modal shift and thus the financial and environmental efficiency of freight transport. Design/methodology/approach The research used a mixed-methods approach where qualitative case interviews and quantitative modeling was combined. Two cases of contractual relationships between a service provider and its intermodal train operator on a specific lane were investigated. The case findings were then consolidated and used as input for {{a model of the}} contractual relation. Findings were sought through an extensive numerical study. Findings The cases reported that intermodal rail operators had a strong production focus, transferring the capacity risk (i. e. the risk of unused capacity) to the service provider, which the service providers argued limited the shift from truck to intermodal transportation. We show that, due to the market structure, it is rational for the operator to transfer the capacity risk but not the profit. Consequently, a modal shift is only likely to occur when there is strong shipper pressure or low capacity risk. We present a risk-sharing contract that could potentially release this dead lock. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) The conclusions are modelling outcomes subject to assumptions based on the cases. For further validation, large-scale quantitative studies are necessary. Practical Implications (if applicable) We show that a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> in which the capacity risk is shared may lead to increased modal shift and hence assumed improved environmental performance. Social implications (if applicable) Instead of arguing for operators to be more customer-focused, policy-makers and other stakeholders may have more to gain by having both actors being more cooperation-focused.

A prime example is the US cellular phone services market in which firms typically offer consumers plans consisting of a fixed monthly fee, an allowance of minutes, and an overage rate for minutes beyond the allowance. Pricing of Internet service is similar in many European countries, where usage is billed per megabyte (Anja Lambrecht and Bernd Skiera 2006). Other examples of three-part tariffs include car leasing contracts, which often include a mileage allowance and charge per mile thereafter. 1 In a variety of rental markets, contracts charge a flat rate for a specified period followed by steep late fees. Finally, introductory credit card offers may also be three-part tariffs. For instance a $ 1, 000 balance might be charged an initial balance transfer fee, zero marginal charge per month for the first six months, and a high marginal charge per month thereafter. The existing literature on nonlinear pricing does not provide a compelling explanation for such pricing patterns. For perfect competition, one expects prices to be driven down to cost, while standard nonlinear pricing models suggest the highest-demand consumer will pay the low-est marginal price. Instead, a tendency of consumers to underestimate the variance of their future demand when choosing a tariff provides a more plausible explanation of observed menus of three-part tariffs. Two important biases lead to this tendency: forecasting overconfidence, which has been well documented in the psychology literature, and projection bias, which is describe...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} four essays. The first essay {{provides a}} comprehensive {{survey of the}} implications of the theories of individual decision making most frequently used in behavioral economics for the optimal pricing strategy of the firm. The second essay focuses on habit forming behavior, namely the behavior when the valuation of the good in each period is affected by whether consumption occurred in preceding periods. It studies how consumers' habit formation affects the pricing policy of firms. Two types of consumers are considered, sophisticated and naive. The latter do not realize that their current consumption is affecting future consumption. Our main result is that under naive habit formation, the optimal pricing pattern is a three part tariff, namely a fixed fee, an amount of units for free and after their end pricing above marginal cost. The firm exploits naivety charging high price towards the end, and low in the beginning triggering the consumption of a forward looking consumer. The third essay studies a market that consists of one firm and habit forming consumers of different degrees of sophistication. The firm cannot observe the sophistication so it screens between the different types of consumers. The menu of contract offered consists of the frequently observed menu of a two-part tariff and a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff.</b> Finally, the fourth essay proposes a second explanation of three part tariffs, {{based on the assumption that}} consumers are forward-looking but impatient. In a dynamic stochastic setting, prices that apply to large volumes tend to be paid towards the end of the contracting period and so are more heavily discounted by consumers. As a result, high prices for large volumes represent an efficient way of extracting surplus. Low prices for small volumes serve to stimulate early consumption, making it more likely that high marginal prices will apply later...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of two essays {{at the intersection of}} Empirical Industrial Organization and Behavioral Economics. They explore how business decisions are more richly explained with additions in psychological insights commonly found among consumers. These behavioral biases can affect a firm's decision to participate and their supply in the market, ultimately impacting market competition, supply thickness, and equilibrium. In Chapter 1, I explore how retailers make entry and exit decisions {{in the context of an}} online marketplace. Using a rich panel of internal data from eBay on dedicated sellers, I analyze a feature of the platform requiring sellers to select among monthly contracts that differ in the listing fee schedules. I further exploit a regime change that introduced a monthly allowance of free listings of inventory, altering all contracts from a two-part tariff to a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff</b> design. This design change was effective in attracting new users and sellers to the platform, encouraging experienced users to become high-volume sellers, and increasing total inventory listed in the marketplace. This is despite little changes in average costs of selling. I demonstrate that standard entry and exit models cannot explain this increase in supply and competition. Instead, I propose loss aversion as an additional factor impacting participation. Chapter 2 investigates how high-volume, experienced retailers value their products and make supply decisions. Using similar data from eBay and exploiting the same contract feature and policy change, I analyze both the sellers’ contract choice decisions and the timing of product listings. By estimating a dynamic model of plan choice and listing decisions, I find that sellers have a limited learning period and hold biased beliefs on the option values of their products. Furthermore, they respond heterogeneously to dynamic incentives and future listing costs, leading to an uneven supply of products on the platform. Using the model estimates, I show that debiasing sellers would increase seller surplus by 6 % but decrease platform listing revenue by 26...|$|E
40|$|Among {{policy-makers}} in Europe the {{modal shift}} - a shift från polluting modes of freight transport to less polluting modes - {{has been a}} popular suggestion for reducing CO 2 -emissions of transportation. In particular, intermodal road-rail solutions, where a combination of road and rail transport is utilized to move trailers and containers, have been stressed as an important measure to reach de desired reduction in emissions. However, {{looking back at the}} development over the last twenty years, no shift to rail-bound transport can be seen. for example, the share of rail-bound transport has decreased. There are several potential explanations to the absence of modal shift. Often, the supply-side is held responsible, with rail operators offering too low quality due to lack of standards, lack of proactivity, and general infrastructure and transport system deficiencies. Others claim the non-existent shift dependson inertia on the demand-side. Innovations on the transport market are driven by the demand-side customers {{and as long as the}} demand-side is not willing to make any adjustments to better fit the supply-side's offers, no shift will occur. Arguably, both underdeveloped service production and demand side inertia create barriers to realize the political ambitions of the EU. But supply- and demand-side problems cannot be discussed in isolation: low service quality leads to low demand and with low demand there are little incentives to invest in quality. On the intermodal transport market (and much of the trucking market as well), supply and demand is matched in contractual relations. These contracts affect the incentives of the players, and from the economics and supply chain management literature it is well known that badly designed contracts and incentives may lead to sub-optimization and double-marginalization effects, including lower production levels and less total profit than what would have been optimal. Therefore, instead of focusing on aggregate behaviour, this research approaches the modal shift by investigating t he contract that governs the sale and purchase of these services. The purpose, is to build a model to explore the currently used contracts on the intermodal market, explain how these contracts may have affected the modal shift, and explore how changes in the contracts and market conditions could increase the share of intermodal transport. The purpose is approached through a research process in which the findings from two company cases, Bring Frigo and Volvo Logistics, are used to model the system. We consider a situation in which a Service Provider approaches an Intermodal Operator to build the service capacity that the service provider can use to satisfy demand created by the upstream Shippers. The system is then modeled as a one-period, continuous, newsvendor modal with fixed costs associated with each train put into operation. Any demand which cannot be satisfied by the intermodal operator is handled by a truck carrier. Contrary to the trucking market, the Operator is the leader in our Stackelberg game, in which the Service Provider decides upon the final modal mix. It is found in the cases that the operators tend to have a strict production focus, preferring to transfer the responsibility of filling the train to the service provider. Since the service providers are used to having very low fixed costs (no own assets), they claim that this way of selling the capacity inhibits the possibilities to increase the rail-share of their modal mix. In the model, we therefore investigate two possible ways to contract the capacity: 1) through a unit price per trailer, in which an arbitrary number of trailers is sold to the service provider at a unit price per trailer, and 2) with a service charge per train, in which the operator charges a fixed rate for operating each train, leaving the responsibility to fill the train to the service provider. The research characterizes these contracts and show that the operator prefers a per-train charge in most instances: the production focus in inherent with the current market structure. It is also shown that the per-train type of payment coordinates the system in several instances and thus outperforms the unit price preferred by the operator. In that, the production focus has no negative impact in the modal mix in these instances. However, none of the contract types can guarantee coordination, leading to lower total profits than optimal. We therefore show how a <b>three-part</b> <b>tariff,</b> in which the operator charges a unit cost per trailer, a service charge per train, and a wealth-transferring component, can achieve full coordination. Such a contract may however be difficult to implement due to its complexity. Analysis with the model shows that policy measures such as a general carbon tax under some circumstances may increase the amount of intermodal capacity although this may not always be the case due to decentralized decision-making. Measures aiming at reducing the financial risks of the markets, such as allowing longer trains, reducing slot-fees, or introducing a well-functioning spor-market may more easily achieve a higher intermodal share. In that, the research provides insight on the mechanisms on the micro-level that may affect the realization of the political visions, with implications for operators and service providers as well as policy-makers. In particular, the semi-fixed cost structure of the intermodal investment has been poorly addressed in the past, and by analyzing the impact this has on the capacity investment, the study builds on previos research on green logistics, as well as mode choice, capacity management, and supply chain contracting. Finally suggestions for future research along the four potential paths are discussed: empirical research to understand the actual rather complex market; relax model assumptions regarding number of time periods, compliance regime, private information, hidden actions and risk aversion; include more players as shippers and infra structure owners; and compare results with other service markets very capacity is "lumpy"...|$|E
