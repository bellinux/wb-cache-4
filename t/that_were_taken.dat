The character was voiced by Adrienne Barbeau in Ascension.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Hotel {{was built}} between 1882 and 1887. It had seven floors, 500 rooms {{and a large}} ballroom which has largely survived intact from its {{original}} design. The original reception room was renamed the Mayflower Room in 1923, and is now called the Salon. Unlike other hotels on Northumberland Avenue <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> over by the War Office, the Grand has survived as an entertainment and exhibition venue.|$|E
5|$|When {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} from the field came later that evening from General McDowell, the 11th New York served as a rearguard. It was during this retreat that the regiment saw its heaviest casualties. Although accounts of the battle differ, most sources list 177 men lost at Bull Run, with 35 men killed, 74 wounded, and another 68 missing and presumed captured. Those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner were initially confined in Richmond. In September, they were transferred to Castle Pinckney, South Carolina, where they remained until they were paroled the following May.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{theological}} and ethical treatises were original written works, {{as compared to}} many of his other writings <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> from his talks. They cover his positions on various controversial issues of theology. Many of them were directed at Stephen, his main antagonist in the church, along with other church officials whom Symeon saw as taking an overly theoretical approach to Christianity. In these pieces Symeon defended {{the traditions of the}} early Byzantine mystical theologians from the teachings of the church officials of his own time. Central to this defense was Symeon's view that the revelation of scripture could only be understood through the experience of divine grace given to the pure of heart during contemplation.|$|E
5|$|The Machias {{community}} expected retaliation by the British Empire, {{and immediately}} petitioned to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for guidance, supplies, and assistance. The Provincial Congress organized {{the defense of}} Machias and remained vigilant. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted {{one of the three}} captured vessels with breastwork, and armed it with guns and swivels <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> from the Margaretta, and changed its name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, the Diligent and the Tatamagouche. The ships' officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbor. The Provincial Congress formally recognized O'Brien and Foster's efforts by commissioning both the Machias Liberty and the Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy with O'Brien as their commander in August 1775. Retaliation from the British did not occur until October 18, 1775, with the Burning of Falmouth.|$|E
