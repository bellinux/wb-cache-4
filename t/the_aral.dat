5|$|The major oceanic {{divisions}} are defined {{in part by}} the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these {{divisions are}} (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea and the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> South <b>Aral</b> Sea was a lake in {{the basin}} of <b>the</b> former <b>Aral</b> Sea which formed in 1986 when that body divided in two, due to {{diversion}} of river inflow for agriculture. In 2003 <b>the</b> South <b>Aral</b> Sea itself split into eastern and western basins, the Eastern Sea and <b>the</b> West <b>Aral</b> Sea, connected by a narrow channel (channel bed at an elevation of 29 m) that balanced surface levels but did not allow mixing, and in 2005 <b>the</b> North <b>Aral</b> Sea was dammed to prevent the collapse of its fisheries, cutting off the only remaining inflow to the southern lakes. In 2008 the Eastern Sea split again, and in May 2009 had almost completely dried out, leaving only the small permanent Barsakelmes Lake between the Northern and Western Seas and increasing the expanse of the Aralkum desert. In 2010, it was partially filled again by meltwater, and by 2014 was once again dry. <b>The</b> West <b>Aral</b> Sea has some replenishment from groundwater in the northwest, and so is likely to avoid desiccation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Aral</b> Sea (Солтүстік Арал теңізі, Северное Аральское море) is {{the portion}} of <b>the</b> former <b>Aral</b> Sea that is fed by the Syr Darya River. It split from <b>the</b> South <b>Aral</b> Sea in 1986 as water levels dropped due to river {{diversion}} for agriculture. The poorly built Dike Kokaral intended to contain <b>the</b> North <b>Aral</b> Sea and save its fisheries failed twice, but in 2005 the government of Kazakhstan was able to fund a more robust design. Since then, water levels have risen faster than expected and fish stocks have increased. Plans to build a second dike to increase water levels further were due to begin in 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the Dike Kokaral {{across the}} Berg Strait was completed. The dike stops water from <b>the</b> North <b>Aral</b> Sea from {{spilling}} over into <b>the</b> South <b>Aral</b> Sea, and thus contributes to maintaining {{and increasing the}} waterlevel in the northern sea.|$|R
5|$|The Cumans, a Turkic tribe {{approached}} the Danube Delta shortly after 1064–1065, and from 1068 {{the entire territory}} between <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea and the lower Danube were controlled by them. But this vast territory was never politically united by a strong central power. The different Cuman groups were under independent rulers or khans who meddled in the political life of the surrounding areas, such as the Rus’ principalities and the Byzantine Empire. In attacking the Byzantine Empire, the Cumans were also assisted by the Vlachs living in the Balkan Mountains (now in Bulgaria) who showed them the mountain paths where no imperial guard was set up.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the internationally recognized environmental crisis of the rapid desiccation of <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea, the five states sharing <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea Basin (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) are developing a strategy to end the crisis. The World Bank and agencies of the United Nations (UN) have developed an Aral Sea Program, {{the first stage of}} which is funded by the five countries and external donors. That stage has seven areas of focus, one of which—land and water management in the upper watersheds—is of primary concern to Kyrgyzstan. Among the conditions detrimental to <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea's environment are erosion from deforestation and overgrazing, contamination from poorly managed irrigation systems, and uncontrolled waste from mining and municipal effluents. Kyrgyzstan's National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) has addressed these problems as part of its first-phase priorities in cooperation with <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea Program.|$|E

25|$|Turkmenistan both {{contributes}} to and {{suffers from the}} consequences of the desiccation of <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea. Because of excessive irrigation, Turkmen agriculture {{contributes to}} the steady drawdown of sea levels. In turn, <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea's desiccation, which had shrunk that body of water by an estimated 59,000 square kilometers by 1994, profoundly affects economic productivity and the health {{of the population of the}} republic. Besides the cost of ameliorating damaged areas and the loss of at least part of the initial investment in them, salinization and chemicalization of land have reduced agricultural productivity in Central Asia by an estimated 20 to 25%. Poor drinking water is the main health risk posed by such environmental degradation. In Dashhowuz Province, which has suffered the greatest ecological damage from <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea's desiccation, bacteria levels in drinking water exceeded ten times the sanitary level; 70% of the population has experienced illnesses, many with hepatitis, and infant mortality is high. Experts have warned that inhabitants will have to evacuate the province by the end of the century unless a comprehensive cleanup program is undertaken. Turkmenistan has announced plans to clean up some of <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea fallout with financial support from the World Bank.|$|E

[...] Discussions had been held on recreating a channel between the somewhat improved North and the desiccated South, along with uncertain wetland restoration plans throughout the region, but political will is lacking.

25|$|Without this {{diversion}} project, <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea, once a body {{of water}} larger than any of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior, seemed destined to become the world's largest salt flat as early as the year 2010. By 1987 so much water had been siphoned off for irrigation of cotton and rice fields south and east of the sea that all shipping and commercial fishing had ceased. Former seaports, active as late as 1973, were reported to be forty to sixty kilometers from the water's edge.

25|$|By the 1980s, nearly 90 {{percent of}} water use in Central Asia was for agriculture.

As the desiccation of <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea came to international attention in the 1980s, water-use policy became a contentious issue between Soviet republics such as Tajikistan, where the main rivers rise, and those farther downstream, including Uzbekistan. By {{the end of the}} Soviet era, the central government had relinquished central control of water-use policy for Central Asia, but the republics had not agreed on an allocation policy.|$|E

The largest project in this phase is the North Aral Sea Project, a direct effort to recover the northern region of <b>the</b> <b>Aral</b> Sea. The North Aral Sea Project’s main initiative is {{the construction of a}} dam across the Berg Strait, a deep channel which connects the North Aral Sea to the South Aral Sea.
