5|$|One {{improvement}} {{that was}} completed was {{the construction of}} the New Junction Canal. This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 {{at a time when they}} had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and continues in a straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder Navigation upstream from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, and so there was little advantage to using this type of boat.|$|E

25|$|China's largest open-pit {{coal mine}} {{is located in}} Haerwusu in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It started {{production}} on 20October 2008, and is operated by Shenhua Group. Its estimated coal output was forecast at 7million tonnes {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2008. With a designed annual capacity of 20million tonnes of crude coal, it will operate for approximately 79years. Its coal reserves total about 1.73billion tonnes. It is rich in low-sulfur steam coal. Mines in Inner Mongolia are rapidly expanding production, with 637 million tons produced in 2009. <b>Transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> from this region to seaports on China's coast has overloaded highways such as China National Highway 110 resulting in chronic traffic jams and delays.|$|E
25|$|In {{northeast}} Kentucky, {{the greater}} Ashland area {{is an important}} transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. Iron and petroleum production, {{as well as the}} <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> by rail and barge, have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990. The population of the area has since stabilized, however, with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of Boyd and Greenup, are part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people (as of 2010) reside within the city limits of Ashland.|$|E

500|$|Following an Act of Parliament of 1861, in 1864 the Eccles, Tyldesley and Wigan {{branch line}} was opened by the London and North Western Railway, {{along with a}} station at Worsley which {{required}} the demolition of six cottages. The first sod had been cut by the Earl of Ellesmere. [...] An additional branch line to Bolton was opened in 1870, branching from the Tyldesley Loopline line at Roe Green. A railway station at Monton Green was opened in 1887 to cater mainly for commuters into Manchester. The lines were important thoroughfares for the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> in the area, including Mosley Common Colliery. Both lines were closed under the Beeching Axe in 1969, and have since been partially reclaimed by Salford City Council as recreational pathways.|$|E
500|$|The Erie Railroad {{obtained}} trackage {{rights on}} the nearby Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) line in the late 1950s, which allowed it to bypass the aging Kinzua Bridge. Regular commercial service ended on June 21, 1959, and the Erie sold the bridge to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of Indiana, Pennsylvania, for $76,000. The bridge was reopened for one day in October 1959 when a wreck on the B line forced trains to be rerouted across the bridge. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Kinzua Bridge [...] "was a critical structure in facilitating the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> from Northwestern Pennsylvania to the Eastern Great Lakes region, and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1935 the {{colliery}} {{was acquired}} by Manchester Collieries. It had large reserves of high-quality coal in the Roger mine below the seams already exploited, and although the mines dipped steeply, was a dry and relatively gas-free pit. Manchester Collieries initially improved coal screening but had plans to develop the colliery and maximise output to 4000 long tons (4480 short tons) per day, involving the complete replacement of the surface works. The Parker shaft was deepened to [...] between 1944 and 1948, and winding installed to accommodate 12-long ton (13.44-short ton) capacity skips. The <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> underground was improved by the installation of three-ton mine cars hauled by a battery-powered locomotive and a system of conveyors. A [...] reinforced concrete winding tower was built to house a Koepe-type friction wheel built by Metropolitan-Vickers.|$|E

30|$|The {{major source}} of ozone-depleting gas {{emissions}} in both the cycles is the steam generation. The fossil fuel-based (natural gas and coal) electricity production for steam generation contributes 33 % of the total ozone-depleting gas emissions. On analyzing the sub-processes, it is traced that 83 % of the ODP of steam generation is attributed to the <b>transport</b> and storage <b>of</b> liquefied natural gas onshore and offshore for utilization in power plants. The liquefaction of natural gas is accomplished by cryogenic treatment, {{which is responsible for}} the emission of three gases, halon 1301, CFC 10, and CFC 114, to the atmosphere which deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The remaining 17 % is contributed by the utilization of diesel for the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> hard <b>coal</b> to power plant locations. The diesel production stage (crude oil refining) involves many low-temperature extraction processes utilizing refrigerants, which emit ozone-depleting gases. It may also be noted that the other two major processes in producer gas life cycle are fertilizer production and irrigation, while <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> through large distance (e.g., oceanic <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> the imported <b>coal)</b> is prominent for coal gas life cycle. The share of natural gas in electricity production and fueling (diesel) transport contributes ozone-harmful gases to these three sub-processes also.|$|R
500|$|Wigan was {{described}} by Celia Fiennes, a traveller, in 1698 as [...] "a pretty market town built of stone and brick". In 1720, the moot hall was rebuilt, funded {{by the members of}} the borough. It was used as the town hall and the earliest reference to it dates from the 15th century. Prior to its final destruction in 1869, the hall was rebuilt in 1829. Wigan's status as a centre for coal production, engineering and textiles in the 18th century led to the Douglas Navigation in the 1740s, the canalisation of part of the River Douglas and later the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The canal from Liverpool to Leeds was originally to serve Wigan on a spur, transporting cloth and food grown on the West Lancashire Plain to the Port of Liverpool. When construction restarted in the 1790s after a decades pause with coal rising in importance during the intervening years due to the progress of the Industrial Revolution the route was altered at the request of mill owners with the spur becoming the primary route and Wigan a hub for <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> from the Lancashire coal pits to Liverpool and Leeds. As a mill town, Wigan was an important centre of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, {{but it was not until}} the 1800s that cotton factories began to spread into the town. This was due to a dearth of fast-flowing streams and rivers in the area, but by 1818 there were eight cotton mills in the Wallgate part of Wigan. In 1818 William Woods introduced the first power looms to the Wigan cotton mills. These mills swiftly became infamous for their dangerous and unbearable conditions, low pay and use of child labour. As well as being a mill town, Wigan was also an important centre for coal production. It was recorded that in 1854 there were 54collieries in and around the town, about a sixth of all collieries in Lancashire.|$|E
2500|$|Honesdale {{is located}} [...] {{northeast}} of Scranton {{in a rural}} area that provides many recreational opportunities, such as boating, fishing, hiking, hunting, skiing, biking, skateboarding, and rafting. Located in a coal mining region, during the nineteenth century it was the starting point of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, which provided for <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to Kingston, New York, and then down the Hudson River to New York City. In the 19th century the expansion of railroads eventually superseded regular use of the canal.|$|E
2500|$|The use of CCS {{can reduce}} [...] {{emissions}} from {{the stacks of}} coal power plants by 85–90% or more, but it {{has no effect on}} [...] emissions due to the mining and <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> It will actually [...] "increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological, land-use, air-pollution, and water-pollution impacts from coal mining, transport, and processing, because the CCS system requires 25% more energy, thus 25% more coal combustion, than does a system without CCS".|$|E

25|$|Rail {{took over}} from the canal as a means <b>of</b> <b>transporting</b> <b>coal</b> out <b>of</b> the area, and Wath-upon-Dearne became a railfreight centre of {{national}} importance. One of the biggest and, for its time, most modern railway marshalling yards in the UK, the Wath marshalling yard was built north of the town in 1907. It {{was one of the}} eastern ends of the trans-Pennine Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electrified railway (also known as the Woodhead Line), a project which spanned the Second World War, and was in part justified by the need to <b>transport</b> large amounts <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> mined in the Wath area to customers in North-West England.|$|R
2500|$|The canal {{was built}} to allow <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> from coal mines near Wyrley, Essington and New Invention to Wolverhampton and Walsall, but also carried {{limestone}} and other goods.

50|$|In {{the same}} year, {{with a view}} to easier <b>transporting</b> <b>of</b> local <b>coal,</b> George and other {{colliery}} operators, excavated a stretch of canal on Cockfield Fell, hoping eventually to join the River Tees at Barnard Castle or to reach the sea, and dispense with the time-consuming practice <b>of</b> hauling <b>coal</b> over 40 miles to the nearest port - George leased a colliery on Cockfield Fell, from Sir Henry Vane, 2nd Earl of Darlington of Raby Castle, where coal and iron had been worked since medieval times. The enormous cost and factions with conflicting interests ensured the failure of this ambitious canal scheme, but the idea did give rise in time, and with the aid of Edward Pease, to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which served the same purpose <b>of</b> <b>transporting</b> <b>coal,</b> though passengers were not carried until September 1825.|$|R
