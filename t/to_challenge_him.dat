5|$|Maloney {{is running}} for {{re-election}} in 2016. Fellow Democrat Diana Hird announced her intention <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> in the primary election on June 28, 2016, but failed to obtain the necessary number of signatures and file a petition {{to get on the}} ballot in time.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain {{and then to the}} capital of present-day Belgium, Brussels, where he settled. He {{intended}} to live there until Mercedes completed her education and then return to Argentina. Rivadavia visited Brussels and San Martín intended <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.|$|E
5|$|Lucien Petit-Breton {{became the}} new leader of the race. Although he had already {{finished}} in fifth place and fourth place in previous years, he was still relatively unknown, and had started in the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées category. Petit-Breton {{finished in the top}} three in the next stages, so no other cyclist was able <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for the overall victory. At the end of the race, he had increased his lead to a margin of 19 points ahead of Garrigou and 27 points ahead of Georget.|$|E
50|$|Khan {{was looking}} for a good {{opponent}} <b>to</b> next <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for his title. One of his possible opponents was Lightweight Champion Juan Manuel Marquez. Marquez decided not to move up in weight and stayed at lightweight.|$|R
6000|$|I {{doubt if}} [...] "Laureate" [...] and [...] "Iscariot" [...] be good rhymes, but must say, as Ben Jonson did <b>to</b> Sylvester, who <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> rhyme with-- ...|$|R
25|$|Lee {{tried to}} get Congress to {{overturn}} the court-martial's verdict. When this failed, he made open attacks on Washington's character. Lee's popularity then plummeted. Colonel John Laurens, an aide <b>to</b> Washington, <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a duel, in which Lee was wounded in his side. Lee was released from his duty on January 10, 1780.|$|R
5|$|Baroš {{failed to}} score {{at the start}} of the 2006–07 season, leading new manager Martin O'Neill <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> in October to prove himself before the January {{transfer}} window. He subsequently scored his first goal of the season in December 2006, eight months since scoring his last one, with a close-range equaliser against Sheffield United in a 2–2 draw. Although he also managed to score for Aston Villa in a 2–1 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup, he left the club in January 2007, having scored just once in 17 league matches that season.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and held first place until he collided with a barrier after swerving to avoid José María López's crashed car on the 17th lap allowing Sam Bird to move into the lead. Some drivers elected to make pit stops to switch to their second cars with Bird choosing to remain on the circuit until his own stop eight laps later. He had technical problems with his second car and Buemi inherited the first position. Di Grassi was no more than two seconds behind Buemi but was unable to get close enough <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> because he had to conserve electrical energy usage and Buemi remained the leader for the rest of the race to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
50|$|While Jimmy How’s man {{delivers}} the supplies Carter waits outside. Carter is suspicious as How’s man re-emerges. It is Tulip wearing the man’s clothes and attempting <b>to</b> flee. Carter <b>challenges</b> <b>him</b> and shoots him dead.|$|R
50|$|James Butler Hickok (Josh Brolin) Wild Bill is hot-tempered {{and quick}} {{to go for}} his gun. He is a fast draw and gains a {{reputation}} as a gunslinger that he doesn't particularly want as it causes people <b>to</b> come <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b> His temper frequently gets him in trouble, though Teaspoon and Sam try to help him learn to control it.|$|R
5000|$|Calatrava {{first visited}} Israel {{for the opening}} of an {{exhibition}} of his works in Haifa in 1997. During that visit, he was invited to design a pedestrian bridge in Petah Tikva, which was opened in 2005. He was invited to Jerusalem by city engineer Uri Shetrit and former mayor Ehud Olmert, who, according <b>to</b> Calatrava, <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> [...] "do the most beautiful contemporary bridge".|$|R
5|$|Webber {{clinched}} the pole position and maintained his lead {{at the start}} of the race with Hamilton in second who fended off a challenge from Sebastian Vettel in the other Red Bull. The order was maintained until the first round of pit stops when Hamilton lost second place after his crew had trouble with fitting one of his tyres correctly. Webber conserved fuel on lap 40 which allowed Vettel <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for the lead but the two collided which led to the latter retiring from the event and the incident promoted Hamilton and Button into the first and second positions. Hamilton and Button were instructed to conserve fuel for the remainder of the race but the latter had not been giving a target lap time and attempted to overtake Hamilton on lap 48 although the former retained the lead which he held for the remaining ten laps to win his first race of the season.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{extended}} his rule southward toward Nazareth and the Marj Ibn Amer plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and Jabal Nablus. Capturing these areas was a drawn-out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in Safad Sanjak, but {{controlled by the}} Jarrar clan based in Nablus Sanjak) caused the ruling clans of the Nablus hinterland (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b> Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, Maghrebi mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents. In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer, killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth. According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Caesar then {{increased}} the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters. Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to more tightly link the other provinces of the empire into a single, cohesive unit. This process, of ossifying the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus. When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, he raised the senate's membership to 900. While the Roman assemblies continued to meet, Caesar submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment, which caused the assemblies to become powerless and unable to oppose him. To minimize the risk that another general might attempt <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him,</b> Caesar passed a law which subjected governors to term limits. Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own Consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all Consuls and Tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the Dictator, and robbed the popular assemblies of much of their remaining influence.|$|E
50|$|Daniel, {{the protagonist}} of the Book of Daniel, was confronted with this {{creature}} by the priests in the apocryphal text. (see Additions <b>to</b> Daniel) They <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> match his invisible God against their living god. Eventually, Daniel poisoned the creature.|$|R
50|$|American Dick Button was the {{dominant}} force in men's international skating, having won the Olympic title in 1948, and the World Championships in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951. Only three men had come close <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>him</b> {{in the years}} since his first Olympic victory, teammates Hayes Jenkins and James Grogan, and Austrian Helmut Seibt, who had won the European Championships in 1951 and 1952. Button took a strong lead after the compulsory figures and just needed to skate safely in the free skating to earn his second gold medal. Instead he chose to perform the triple loop, which was the first triple jump ever performed in international competition. He executed the jump without error and finished his skate cleanly, he was awarded perfect marks by the judges and won his second Olympic gold medal.|$|R
50|$|Ryōhei's next plot to {{have all}} seventy of the Yoshioka swordsmen ambush Musashi at Ichijouji field {{proved to be the}} school's undoing: Musashi overheard the plot only for Ryōhei <b>to</b> {{formally}} <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> without changing the plan or at least preparing the Yoshioka swordsmen for what was essentially a murder plot that had been given away. As a result, Musashi ended the Yoshioka school by literally destroying the school's membership in that final encounter.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes {{the role of}} a {{stranger}} who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b> If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand {{was between}} Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy {{at the same}} event where John Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match, where thirty wrestlers competed in a ring and were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope when he last eliminated Triple H. By winning the match, Cena became a top contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he decided <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> at No Way Out. In the match, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship due to WWE regulations. That same night, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match, which featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by chains and girders. The next night on Raw, Cena argued that he deserved another WWE Championship match. Raw General Manager William Regal, who was portrayed as a matchmaker and rules enforcer, then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night. Regal added a stipulation to the match that if Cena won, he would {{be added to the}} WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple threat match, a standard match that involves three wrestlers. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest Referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the month}} of December 1863, Bahá'u'lláh and his family {{embarked}} on a twelve-day journey to Adrianople. [...] Bahá'u'lláh stayed in Adrianople for {{four and a half}} years. In Adrianople Bahá'u'lláh made his claim to be Him whom God shall make manifest more public through letters and tablets. Bahá'u'lláh's assertion as an independent Manifestation of God made Subh-i-Azal's leadership position irrelevant; Subh-i-Azal, upon hearing Bahá'u'lláh's words in a tablet read <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> accept Bahá'u'lláh's revelation, refused and <b>challenged</b> Bahá'u'lláh <b>to</b> a test of divine will at a local mosque, but he lost face when he did not appear. This caused a break within the Bábí community, and the followers of Bahá'u'lláh became known as Bahá'ís, while the followers of Subh-i-Azal became known as Azalis.|$|R

25|$|By early 2006, five Republicans campaigned in {{the primary}} for the right <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> in the general election, with state {{treasurer}} Judy Baar Topinka eventually winning the nomination. Blagojevich formally began his 2006 re-election campaign for Governor of Illinois on February 19, 2006. He won the Democratic primary on March 21 with 72% of the vote against challenger Edwin Eisendrath, whom Blagojevich would not debate.|$|E
25|$|He was {{inspired}} to run for Congress by a suggestion from a talk radio show host that voters demand town hall meetings with their congressmen during {{the health care bill}} Tea Party movement protests of August 2009. Cravaack went with 25people to one of Oberstar's Minnesota offices asking for a meeting that day and when Oberstar did not come, Cravaack decided <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> in the November 2010 election.|$|E
25|$|When Caesar {{returned}} to Rome in 47 BC, {{the ranks of}} the Senate had been severely depleted, so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900. All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him. To minimise the risk that another general might attempt <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him,</b> Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 November 2014, {{well known}} Scottish {{football}} pundit Richard Gordon (broadcaster) called Jaggy MacBee [...] "the most ridiculous thing in Scottish football" [...] live on BBC Radio Scotland's football show Sportsound.

5000|$|Bodu Bala Sena {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} from notable representatives of every political party which represent the Sri Lankan parliament except Jathika Hela Urumaya, a Sinhala nationalist political party, for its ideology and actions. Some believe BBS is a front group for Western countries {{who wish to}} divide the Sri Lankan population in order to serve western interests. For example, Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan government minister, has asked that BBS challenge [...] "the Norway agent in its organization" [...] in response <b>to</b> BBS's <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to prove BBS has received funds from a Norwegian NGO.|$|R
25|$|At Epsom on 31 May, Petrarch started 2/1 {{favourite}} for the Derby, {{with the}} Mineral colt, now named Kisber being the second {{choice in the}} betting. Petrarch {{took the lead in}} the straight, but when Kisber emerged <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> a furlong from the finish he quickly faded from contention and finished fourth of the fifteen runners. It was later suggested that Petrarch's connections had never intended to win the race, and that his poor performance had been deliberately engineered as part of a betting strategy.|$|E
25|$|Following Wilson's {{unexpected}} defeat by Edward Heath in the 1970 General Election, Callaghan declined <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for {{the leadership}} despite Wilson's vulnerability. This {{did much to}} rehabilitate him in Wilson's eyes. He {{was in charge of}} drawing up a new policy statement in 1972 which contained the idea of the Social Contract between the government and trade unions. He also did much to ensure that Labour opposed the Heath government's bid to enter the Common Market—forcing Wilson's hand by making his personal opposition clear without consulting the Party Leader.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by his brother's {{successful}} {{election in}} 1978, Street made his initial foray into elected politics in 1979, when he challenged incumbent Fifth District Councilman Cecil B. Moore. Moore {{was a popular}} and respected civil rights leader in the city who was active within the NAACP, and Street's decision <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> drew the ire of some. Moore was, however, in failing health. He initially sought to see-off the challenge from Street, but died before the May primary. Street won the election, and quelled some of the tensions over his original challenge to Moore by sponsoring a bill to rename the former Columbia Avenue in Moore's honor.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch {{very likely}} was {{influenced}} by Dante's Divine Comedy for his Africa. Dante's prestigious work was well known and surely a <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Dante's remarks of praise of medieval heroes in his Comedia, Convivio, Espitole and De monarchia also had an influence on Petrarch.|$|R
