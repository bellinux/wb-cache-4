In this context, the aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the eco-profile, the energy savings and the environmental benefits of the use of recycled raw materials to manufacture <b>products</b> for <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> of buildings in Italy (i. e., PET bottles postconsumer). Materials and methods The life cycle analysis is developed according to ISO 14040 / 44.

So far, some of its assessed material properties (e. g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>product,</b> a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required {{for most of the}} above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3 cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound <b>insulation</b> <b>products</b> (e. g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound <b>insulation</b> <b>products</b> (e. g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose).

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> is {{important}} to achieve energy efficiency in a buildings' lifespan while maintaining comfort. Traditionally, the majority of insulation in buildings is man-made petroleum based products with limited or no-end life usage.

Furthermore, they are also highly influenced by the increasing price and the ongoing scarcity of fossil fuel oils.

30|$|An {{alternative}} development concept is to aim to use environmentally friendly products. One aspect of being environmentally friendly is effective utilization of unused resources. Using agricultural wastes, forest product wastes, textile wastes, and so on, as {{the raw materials}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>products</b> is favorable for working towards a sustainable society based on resource recycling. For instance, Binici et al. [3] investigated the k-value of fiber mats made of sunflower stalks, Zhou et al. [4] reported a k-value for binderless cotton stalk fiberboards, and Yamauchi et al. [5] published a k-value for thick insulation panels made from sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) bark and used as a floor heating base material. The k-values of these insulation materials range from 0.050 to 0.073  W/(mK) because their density is more than 150  kg/m 3. Although these k-values are greater than (i.e., inferior to) that of the glass wool commonly used in buildings, the materials are nevertheless fully usable, {{as long as a}} building has space to accommodate thick insulation materials. The other environmentally friendly aspect to consider is the energy consumption involved in production of the materials. Most thermal insulation materials require a heating process in their manufacturing line. Based on both of these aspects, cellulose fiber (CF) is an advantageous insulation material because it is made of waste newspapers and does not require a heating process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hollow {{glass beads}} (HGBs) {{are a new}} kind of filler in rubber, plastics, and coating {{industries}} for the production of light, sound, or <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>products</b> with their smooth surface and stiffness. The tensile properties and flexural strength of acrylnitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS) filled with HGBs have been measured at room temperature to identify the effects of the particle contents on these properties. The mean diameter of the beads is 70 mm. The surface of the particles are pretreated with a silane coupling agent. The results show that the Young’s modulus increases approximately linearly with the increase in volume fraction (f) of the HGB. When f is < 5 %, the tensile yield stress increases and then decreases with increasing f. When f is < 15 %, the tensile strength at break of the composites increases with the increase of f and then it remains roughly constant. Similarly, the tensile fracture strain of the composites increases when f is < 5 %, and then it decreases with increasing f. Furthermore, the flexural strength increases with an increase of f, and the relationship between them is consistent in a quadratic equation. The improvement of the tensile and flexural properties of the composite may be attributed to the smooth spherical surface and good interfacial bonding between the ABS matrix and the hollow beads...|$|E
40|$|Effectiveness of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>products</b> is {{determined}} {{by a set of}} criteria that can be expressed in terms of energy costs: reduction of the cost of heating (the main criterion), energy consumption in the course of construction, energy consumption in the course of production of materials having pre-set properties, and service durability of the material. On the one hand, service durability (as a property) is generated in the course of material production, and on the other hand, it depends on the conditions that the material is exposed to in the course of any construction process. The same parameter affects energy-related criteria. Insulation replacement or unplanned repairs add supplementary energy costs. The manufacturing process of thermal insulation materials contemplates processing of a significant amount of non-renewable natural resources, namely, fuel combustion. Optimization of these costs is necessary and possible through appropriate organization of processes, including the process of heat treatment of products. Layered materials can improve the product performance and durability. Production and heat treatment of mineral fibers are the most energy-consuming steps of the mineral wool production. Optimization of these processes can involve significant economic effects.
