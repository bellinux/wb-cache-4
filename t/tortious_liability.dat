25|$|Following Roman law, the English {{system has}} long been based on a closed system of {{nominate}} torts, such as trespass, battery and conversion. This {{is in contrast to}} continental legal systems, which have since adopted more open systems of <b>tortious</b> <b>liability.</b> There are various categories of tort, which lead back to the system of separate causes of action. The tort of negligence is however increasing in importance over other types of tort, providing a wide scope of protection, especially since Donoghue v Stevenson. For liability under negligence a duty of care must be established owed to a group of persons to which the victim belongs, a nebulous concept into which many other categories are being pulled.|$|E
500|$|It {{requires}} that the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim (it is for the judge to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal duty to act – rather than a duty of care – is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised {{the nature of the}} duty of care requirement as [...] "decision-making at its retrospective worst".|$|E
40|$|The key {{question}} {{in this chapter}} is who, {{in the context of}} carriage by sea, should bear the contractual or <b>tortious</b> <b>liabilities</b> arising from crew negligence. The issue has been answered based on a comparative study of English law and Chinese law. The paper scrutinises the current law regarding the civil liabilities that may be imposed on the crew and the ship, and any defences or limitation of liability that avails to the crew under both jurisdictions at issue. It is also to analyse the impact of crew negligence on the allocation of risks of losses between the carrier and the cargo owner and the trends in law on this matter...|$|R

2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the status of}} the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that [...] "to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law", that [...] "right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining", [...] "that workmen have a right to strike", and that this is [...] "a fundamental human right". This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith trade dispute as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach of contract, and this creates <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> for unions organising collective action, unless it falls within an immunity from statute. On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure, inducement of breach of contract, and tortious interference with a contract. However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula, that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any liability in tort if done [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike.|$|E

5000|$|It is, no doubt, proper when {{considering}} <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> for negligence to analyse its elements {{and to say}} that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed to him by the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and consequent damage.

50|$|Finding a {{successful}} defence absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages, {{which makes them}} valuable commodities in the court.

40|$|Adoctor in {{the course}} of {{rendition}} of medical service to his patient shall comply with certain legal requirements. Accordingly he shall obtain the consent of a patient and the consent so obtained must be an informed one. He shall exercise reasonable care and skill in rendering his professional services. Any lapse on his part in this regard invites liability in the form of trespass for non-consensual treatment and <b>tortious</b> or contractual <b>liability</b> for medical negligence and failure to obtain an informed consent. In the above contemplated circumstances, a doctor attracts liability for deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act, subject to the conditions contemplated there in.

40|$|There is {{much debate}} over {{corporate}} social responsibility on whether business companies should look beyond shareholder primacy and profit maximisation to act {{for the benefit of}} others. But it is generally agreed, even amongst advocates of shareholder primacy, that profit maximisation should only be achieved within the framework of external laws regulating the conduct of individuals and companies generally. If the objectives of such external laws are not to be defeated, then it is important for controllers of companies to ensure corporate compliance with the law. Yet controversies have arisen (such as the James Hardie scandal) where corporate enterprises may have improperly flouted or evaded liabilities under the law. Against this background, the thesis argues {{that it is necessary to}} ensure that responsible persons are accountable under the law so as to promote compliance with legal regulations in the corporate context. Individuals or entities behind the company who are responsible for wrongful conduct should be held liable under the law ― whether it be tort law or statutory regulation. Some counter that the corporate law principles of limited liability and separate entity have primacy to effectively shield those behind the company from at least certain types of liability. However, the thesis argues that it is undesirable for corporate insiders to hide behind the company to avoid <b>tortious</b> or statutory <b>liabilities.</b> The thesis adopts a theory of interactive (corrective) justice to be applied in the corporate context to justify the imposition of civil liability on responsible directors, shareholders and other corporate participants. In light of this theoretical framework, possibilities of rectifying deficiencies in the law through judicial development of existing legal principles will be examined. To the extent that appropriate directions in the law cannot be achieved via judicial development of the law, the thesis also investigates possibilities of statutory reform.

50|$|When a state {{criminal}} {{statute is}} violated {{in the course}} of performing an assertedly negligent act, under certain circumstances a court may adopt the statute as establishing a standard of care for <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> as well. This is negligence per se. It follows the reasoning that if a legislature reached findings of public interest in enacting the statute, these same considerations could arguably apply in cases of negligence. There is no negligence per se doctrine in federal law.|$|E
50|$|The usual rule is {{overridden}} by s.2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 for {{a remedy}} under the tort of deceit, making the damages tortious. If the losses are calculated under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for misrepresentation are calculated {{as if the}} defendant had been fraudulent, {{even if he has}} been only negligent. This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to <b>tortious</b> <b>liability.</b> <b>Tortious</b> <b>liability</b> has a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable, which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a term will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's reliance interest, whereas damages for breach of contract protect C's expectation interest, although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case. In certain cases though, the courts have awarded damages for loss of profit, basing it on loss of opportunity.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of constitutional tort law in India {{began in the}} early 1980s. It influenced the direction tort law in India took during the 1990s.

50|$|Administrative {{liability}} in English law {{is an area}} of law concerning the <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> of public bodies in English law. The existence of private law tort applying to public bodies is a result of Diceyan constitutional theory suggesting that it would be unfair if a separate system of liability existing for government and officials. Therefore a public body which acts ultra vires is liable in tort is a cause of action can be established just like any individual would be. An ultra vires action will not, per se, give rise to damages Therefore a claimant will have to fit into one of the recognised private law courses of action. These areas in which a public body can incur private {{liability in}} tort were described by Lord Browne Wilkinson in X and others (minors) v Bedfordshire County Council 1995 3 All ER 353 (HL).|$|E

However, Donoghue otherwise attracted little attention; it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence. The majority of the Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Cohen and Lord Justice Asquith) therefore held in Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co that Donoghue had not affected <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> for negligent misstatement. This narrow understanding of Donoghue changed with the cases of Hedley Byrne v Heller in 1963 and Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{landmark}} case in Ireland, with the profound implication {{as stated by}} Osborough (1976): [...] "The immunity of the State in tort had been given its quietus" [...] and {{the concerns of the}} judge in the High Court about the risks of Ministers and their servants being held liable for errors indicates how significant the subsequent ruling in the Supreme Court was. Judicial acts would seem to be protected with immunity by common law rules and the Constitution. The judgement in Byrne v Ireland and the Attorney General also reinforced and extended the existing <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> of the State relating to road accidents caused by agents of the State in publicly owned vehicles in the Civil Liability Act (1961). The historical context of the landmark decision is captured in Binchy's (2016) characterisation of it as marking the emerging nature of the Irish state as a servant of its people rather than a repository of sovereign rights and immunity inherent in the Crown.|$|E
5000|$|Balfour's Conservative {{government}} later {{set up a}} Royal Commission, {{a decision}} that was unpopular among trade unionists. The decision {{was a turning point}} for the newly formed Labour Representation Committee. Affiliation from trade unions to the LRC stood at 350,000 in 1901 but rose to 450,000 in 1902 and 850,000 in 1903. Five more joined this cause in through the formation of the 'League Chat'. A mass movement was being formed that {{led to the creation of}} the modern British Labour Party. Subsequently the Labour party was elected in a significant minority of the seats in Parliament and, in partnership with the Liberal government, passed the Trade Disputes Act 1906. This overrode the ruling in Taff Vale and provided the foundation for the law on the right to strike in the UK, that no cause of action could be brought against a trade union for economic loss, if a strike was [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". Although, English law does not provide a 'right' to strike in the strict sense, it is better seen as providing immunity from <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> should certain substantive and procedural requirements be met.|$|E
50|$|In principle, the <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> runs in {{parallel}} to liability in contract. Subject {{to the rules}} of privity of contract, one who has entered into a contract can sue or be sued on the contract which will set out the terms of the service to be provided by the professional person, and if there is no express term to this effect, there will be an implied term that the service will be performed with reasonable care and skill, per s13 Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. The standard of care required to satisfy this contractual obligation is the same as in negligence, but the circumstances in which each liability may arise differ in that contracts are voluntarily created between the parties, while the duty of care is imposed by operation of law. However, suppose that a solicitor contracts with a medical expert to prepare a report for the purposes of personal injury litigation. The beneficiary of this work will be the client but there is no direct contractual relationship between the expert and the client. It may therefore be argued that since the parties have decided to arrange their relationships to avoid direct contractual obligations, the client should not be permitted to sue in tort, bypassing the privity rule and any exclusion clauses in the contract.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the initial}} scope of {{revision}} being ‘technical reform’, the 1992 BW enacted substantive modifications {{to both the}} prior Code and established case-law. The technical focus of the revised code is borrowed from the German BGB. The distinction between civil law and commercial law was done away with and brought under the broader ambit of private law. The Code now covers all aspects of commercial regulation—company, insurance, transport, consumer, and labour laws. For example, the 1992 Code now specifically regulates commercial contracts (Book 6, art. 119(a)). An unjust enrichment action is available (Book 6, art. 212), as are rescissory actions for vitiated consent or an ‘abuse of circumstances’ (Book 6, art. 44(4)). More generally, requirements of good faith now {{appear to be a}} constant theme throughout the Code: Book 6, art. 1 provides that both parties in a relationship are to behave equitably and reasonably towards each other. This appears to extend beyond contracts into other areas of law. The 1992 Code is more technical, systematic, and abstract than its predecessor. It is also more conceptual, providing for many well-defined principles at differing levels of abstraction. Throughout, the Code lays out a strict pattern of general rules upon which are built detailed ones. For example, <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> is founded on a general concept of an unlawful civil wrong. The concept will have differing applications in different circumstances. The Code is also more nuanced, providing for degree and qualification where an ‘all or nothing’ approach may have prevailed under the prior Code. The Code also loosens the legal positivism of the French system in favour of granting courts wider discretion in adjudicating cases. This discretion permits ‘intermediate solutions’ (i.e., not slavishly statutory) to complex problems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presumptive}} {{choice of}} law rule for tort is that the proper law applies. This refers to the law that has the greatest relevance to the issues involved. In public policy terms, this is usually {{the law of the}} place where the key elements of the [...] "wrong" [...] were performed or occurred (the lex loci delicti). So if A is a pedestrian injured by B's negligent driving, the law of the state in which the injury occurs would logically be applied because, in public policy terms, the citizens of that state have a clear interest in regulating the standard of driving on their roads. That either or both the parties might have domiciles outside that state would be irrelevant. But, if A buys a car from B in State X and drives it into State Y where A is injured by a defect in the car, the {{choice of law}} is not as evident: there is potential liability both for breach of contract and for negligent misstatement, deceit and failure to adequately maintain the vehicle prior to sale. There is no genuine connection either in fact or law with the law of State Y. It was pure chance that the injury occurred there. In fact, the law of State X is the lex loci contractus and the most appropriate law since everything relevant to the potential <b>tortious</b> <b>liability</b> occurred in that state which has the greatest interest in maintaining consumer confidence in the motor trade. Thus, no matter where A sues B, the forum court should apply the law of State X to resolve the various causes of action. For these purposes, the forum conveniens would be the State in which B has residence and/or holds assets. One of the key considerations in any conflict dispute is the enforceability of the resulting judgment. Courts are more willing to accept cases with a foreign law element when one of the parties is domiciled or has residence within their territorial jurisdiction, or has assets against which judgment can be levied.|$|E
5000|$|In Morris v Murray (1990) 3 AER 801 the {{claimant}} helped an obviously drunken pilot {{get into a}} small aeroplane, which crashed as it attempted to take off. This was a classic case for volenti to apply. The court held that {{the claimant}} must have known the condition of the pilot and voluntarily took the risk of negligence by agreeing to be a passenger. However, in driving cases, s149 Road Traffic Act 1988 denies the effectiveness of any agreement between a passenger of a motor vehicle and the driver that seeks to exclude liability for negligence where insurance cover for passengers is compulsory. This applies both to express agreements between driver and passenger (e.g. where the driver displays a notice in the vehicle stating that passengers travel at their own risk) and to implied agreements in cases such as Pitts v Hunt (1991) 1 QB 24, where the claimant was a passenger on a motor cycle knowing that the driver was drunk, uninsured, and without a current licence. The defendant negligently collided with another vehicle, killing himself and injuring the passenger. Dillon LJ. dismissed the claim on the ground of ex turpi causa because there was a joint common purpose. This is a public policy test of [...] "public conscience" [...] because the claimant might otherwise benefit from the unlawful behaviour willingly undertaken. Similarly, under ss1 and 2 Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, commercial agreements seeking to exclude liability in negligence are also void. But if the claimant signs an express agreement identifying the nature of the risks likely to be run and accepting those risks, this is evidence that the claimant is volens and has chosen to run the risk not by compulsion or as the lesser of two or more evils i.e. the contractual clause is an express volenti exclusion clause for the purposes of <b>tortious</b> <b>liability.</b> Because knowledge of a risk does not of itself imply consent, the UCTA prevails and such clauses do not automatically exclude liability. This would particularly apply in medical cases where informed consent is traditionally evidenced in a written form (Luckham: 2004).|$|E
