5|$|Richard's {{most loyal}} subject was John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. The duke had served Richard's brother {{for many years}} and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants. He was a {{military}} veteran, having fought in the Battle of Towton in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old Anne de Mowbray, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.|$|E
25|$|In 1829, {{slavery was}} officially outlawed in Mexico. Austin {{feared that the}} edict would cause {{widespread}} discontent and tried to suppress publication of it. Rumors {{of the new law}} quickly spread throughout the area and the colonists seemed on the brink of revolt. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, Jose Maria Viesca, wrote to the president to explain the importance of slavery to the Texas economy, and the importance of the Texas economy {{to the development of the}} state. Texas was temporarily exempted from the rule. On April 6, 1830, Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante ordered Texas to comply with the emancipation proclamation or face military intervention. <b>To</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> many Anglo colonists converted their slaves into indentured servants for life. Others simply called their slaves indentured servants without legally changing their status. Slaveholders wishing to enter Mexico would force their slaves to sign contracts claiming that the slaves owed money and would work to pay the debt. The low wages the slave would receive made repayment impossible, and the debt would be inherited, even though no slave would receive wages until age eighteen. This tactic was outlawed by an 1832 state law which prohibited worker contracts from lasting more than tenyears. A small number of slaves were imported illegally from the West Indies or Africa. The British consul estimated that in the 1830s approximately 500slaves had been illegally imported into Texas. By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.|$|E
500|$|The main {{issues in}} the case were whether or not abridgements of a work {{inherently}} constituted copyright infringement, or whether they could qualify as a separate, new work. Lord Hartwicke ruled that abridgements fell under two categories: [...] "true abridgements" [...] and [...] "coloured shortenings". True abridgements presented a true {{effort on the part}} of the editor, and by this effort, constituted a new work which did not infringe upon the copyright of the original. Leaving it to literary and legal experts to decide, Hartwicke ruled that Modern Crown Law was not a true abridgement, but merely a duplication intending <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

500|$|The opinion, {{written by}} Hardwicke, {{found that a}} true {{abridgement}} of a published book may be considered an entirely separate, new work, as the abridgement showed the labour, originality, education, and judgement of the editor. This new book did not {{run the risk of}} infringing the rights of the author or bookseller who owned the publishing rights. However, Lord Hardwicke drew a distinction between works [...] "fairly made" [...] and those [...] "colourably shortened". Hardwicke refused to compare the books himself to determine whether Modern Crown Law was indeed a fair abridgement, or to force a judge and jury to sit and hear both books read, instead opting to have two legal experts and a literary master read the books and report the findings to the court. The parties were allowed to choose these examiners, in a way leaving the case to arbitration. After a week in which the parties were given a chance to make amends outside of court, the book in question was ruled a colourable shortening, created only <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and thus was an infringement of Gyles' printing rights.|$|E

25|$|The move by {{retailers}} to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as {{opposed to the}} traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest. In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself. Blue laws in several Northeastern states prevent retailers in those states from opening on Thanksgiving.

6000|$|That {{the second}} Bull {{undoubtedly}} contains {{the truth of}} the matter is the only possible explanation of its existence, and the [...] "good reasons" [...] that existed for the first one are, no doubt, as Gregorovius says, that officially and by canon law the Pope was inhibited from recognizing children. (His other children, be it remembered, were recognized by him during his cardinalate and before his elevation to St. Peter's throne.)

60|$|Now, bastards were by {{canon law}} {{excluded}} from the purple, and it is probably upon this circumstance that both Infessura and Guicciardini have built the assumption that some such means as these had been adopted <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and--as so often happens in chronicles concerning the Borgias--the assumption is straightway stated as a fact. But there were other ways of circumventing awkward commandments, and, unfortunately for the accuracy of these statements of Infessura and Guicciardini, another way was taken in this instance. As early as 1480, Pope Sixtus IV had granted Cesare Borgia--in a Bull dated October 1(1)--dispensation from proving the legitimacy of his birth. This entirely removed the necessity for any such subsequent measures as those which are suggested by these chroniclers.|$|E

500|$|Another {{account in}} this series is [...] "Ivan Turbincă", whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and {{ultimately}} accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death. The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition's Till Eulenspiegel. In {{the beginning of the}} account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (turbincă), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending not to understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present several expert systems that predict the class {{identity}} of the modeled compounds, based on a preprocessed spectral database. The expert systems were built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and are designed to predict if an unknown compound has the toxicological activity of amphetamines (stimulant and hallucinogen), {{or whether it is}} a nonamphetamine. In attempts <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> controlling drugs of abuse, new chemical structures are very frequently introduced on the black market. They are obtained by slightly modifying the controlled molecular structures by adding or changing substituents at various positions on the banned molecules. As a result, no substance similar to those forming a prohibited class may be used nowadays, even if it has not been specifically listed. Therefore, reliable, fast and accessible systems capable of modeling and then identifying similarities at molecular level, are highly needed for epidemiological, clinical, and forensic purposes. In order to obtain the expert systems, we have preprocessed a concatenated spectral database, representing the GC-FTIR (gas chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry) and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) spectra of 103 forensic compounds.
