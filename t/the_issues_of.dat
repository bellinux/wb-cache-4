40|$|Expectation {{gap between}} users of {{financial}} statements with auditor's failure {{to reveal the}} presence of auditors in performing their roles and responsibilities. The general public often assumes that the auditing and accounting are the same thing, although it is fundamentally different. Understanding the difference is what triggers the emergence of expectation gap. The hypothesis {{in this study is}} no expectation gap on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> auditors and <b>the</b> audit process, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> auditors, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> competence and independence, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> auditor performance between users of governmental financial statements with government auditors. The sample in this study were users of financial statements of the government represented by the Regional Parlementary Commission C and the local legislative area of the budget, and government auditors are represented by the BPK. Samples obtained by convenience sampling. Data obtained by using questionnaires that were then analyzed with a different test t-test. The results of the study {{is that there is a}} significant expectation gap on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> auditors and <b>the</b> audit process, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> auditors, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> competence and independence, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> auditor performance between users of governmental financial statements with government auditors. Government auditors have a more positive perception of the auditors and the audit process, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> auditors, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> competence and independence, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> auditor performance in comparison with users of government financial statements...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Newsom gained {{national}} attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the then-current state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time.

However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll.|$|E
50|$|Asymmetric {{information}} favours <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> debt over equity as <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> debt signals <b>the</b> boards {{confidence that}} an investment is profitable {{and that the}} current stock price is undervalued (were stock price over-valued, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> equity would be favoured). <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> equity would signal a {{lack of confidence in}} the board and that they feel the share price is over-valued. An <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> equity would therefore lead to a drop in share price. This does not however apply to high-tech industries where <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> equity is preferable due to the high cost <b>of</b> debt <b>issue</b> as assets are intangible.|$|R

5|$|Tokyopop {{published}} 12 Days in North America on 7 November 2006, to generally positive reviews.

Reviewers also discussed the comic's treatment of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> love, loss, and lesbian elements.

5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} nuclear power in Australia owing to <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of the}} first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E

As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee. He also visits local schools to give talks to the students. Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football.

5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E

5|$|In January 1985, Collins renewed her {{push for}} {{additional}} education funding and changes by appointing herself {{secretary of the}} state Education and Humanities Cabinet.

5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
