500|$|In 1977, Yoshiki and Toshi {{formed a}} band called Dynamite in their {{hometown}} of Tateyama, Chiba, {{when they were}} just 11 years old. Dynamite {{changed its name to}} Noise in 1978, while they were still in high school. In 1982, Noise disbanded and Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, they named it X while they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of another name, but the name stuck. X began to actively perform in the Tokyo area in 1985 with a frequently changing lineup. They originally attempted to pitch in with Japan's underground punk movement, but the band did not fit in with it as they were considered too commercial and flamboyant. Their first single, [...] "I'll Kill You" [...] was released on Dada Records in June and the band contributed [...] "Break the Darkness" [...] to the sampler Heavy Metal Force III in November, which also featured a song by Saver Tiger. In November 1985 bassist Taiji (ex:Dementia) joined X, though he left the group shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as the}} Emperor, and a general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were first explored with the script for the two-part [...] "Kitumba". Writer John Meredith Lucas said that [...] "I wanted something that we {{had never seen before}} on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on." [...] While the episode itself was later filmed for the fan production , Star Trek first visited the Klingon homeworld in The Next Generation episode [...] "", and the themes would be revisited through the series.|$|E
500|$|After marrying Mary Chappel on January 31, 1828, {{they moved}} to Middleburg Township in Cuyahoga County, Ohio in April of that year. It was there that Baldwin joined forces with James Gilbrith, a disciple of Josiah Holbrook who wanted to found a lyceum village. In the village, {{which was founded in}} 1837 and {{situated}} just north of his farm, Baldwin ran the Lyceum Village School for five years until June 1842, when it went bankrupt. However, one day while walking home, he had an impulse to take a new route across the river on his farm. He noticed a grouping of exposed rocks, which would make superior grindstones. This {{was the beginning of the}} Berea grindstone industry. Baldwin shipped his grindstones to Cleveland by ox carts. After the Big Four Railroad was built from Cleveland to Cincinnati, Baldwin built a railroad which would connect his quarries to the Big Four Depot. It was then that Baldwin and the others of the Lyceum Village <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a name for their new town. After Gilbrith proposed Tabor, John Baldwin suggested Berea, citing [...] After a coin flip, Berea was chosen.|$|E

500|$|Mike Scully, {{who worked}} as an {{executive}} producer and show runner for the episode, stated in the episode's DVD audio commentary that {{the first thing the}} writers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of while writing the episode was how the Simpson family would fit into the story. In the episode's first draft, Gloria worked as a food truck driver; however, this was later changed so that she instead worked as a police lady. Scully also stated that, in the scene after Homer carries Burns and Gloria up the stairs, there were originally a lot of jokes about Homer [...] "taking care of business" [...] for Burns; however, the staff decided to leave it out since it would make Homer [...] "unlikable." [...] In the episode, Snake Jailbird's mailbox reads [...] "Snake (Jailbird)" [...] which is a reference to a debate that the writers had over whether Snake's mailbox would read [...] "Snake" [...] or [...] "Jailbird". Originally, the episode would end with Burns taking the [...] "pocket fox" [...] extract, however when seeing the animatic, the writers felt that that ending would be [...] "too slow", so they changed it into Gloria falling in love with Snake again.|$|E
500|$|... "Chair Model" [...] was {{the third}} episode of the series {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz had previously directed [...] "The Convict" [...] and [...] "The Negotiation". The episode was written by B. J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode [...] "Michael Dating", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have seen it before [...] "Dinner Party" [...] aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, [...] "Parking" [...] {{was going to be}} the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested [...] "Chair Model", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a [...] "phony management training", but NBC pointed out that it felt like the writers had done it before even though they had not. As a group, the writers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} bowling, Kilner was an {{effective}} performer on rain affected pitches. His accuracy also {{enabled him to}} bowl on good pitches without the batsmen being able to score too many runs. In 1923, journalist Alfred Pullin said Kilner spun the ball {{more than any other}} English bowler. He noted, as did Wisden, how Kilner often bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets, unusual for a left-arm spinner in this period. This established a contrast with his fellow left-arm spinner, Wilfred Rhodes, and increased their effectiveness. Furthermore, it allowed him to surprise batsmen with a different delivery, such as one which did not turn. Kilner's Wisden portrait also credited him with the gift of imagination, describing how he always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of new ways to beat and dismiss batsmen. He would experiment with his bowling, for example altering his pace slightly, if conditions were unfavourable towards bowlers. Kilner delivered left-arm wrist spin at times, constantly practising it in the cricket nets. His brother Norman believed Roy was the person who coined the term [...] "chinaman" [...] to describe such a style, although other players have also claimed to originate the phrase.|$|E

500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used to talk about them [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Brian√ßonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter R√∂hrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader R√∂hrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that something might break in my car and I can no longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Noise disbanded in 1982, Yoshiki and Toshi {{formed a}} new band, which they named X while they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of another name, {{but the name}} stuck. In 1986, Yoshiki founded his own {{independent}} record label, Extasy Records, in order to distribute the band's music. On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS/Sony {{which led to a}} recording contract in August of the following year. The band's breakthrough came in 1989 with the release of their second, and major debut, album Blue Blood, which reached number six on the Oricon chart and charted for more than 100 weeks. [...] In 1990, the band received the [...] "Grand Prix New Artist of the Year" [...] award at the 4th Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 1991 they released their hit million-selling album Jealousy, and were the first Japanese metal band to perform in Japan's largest indoor concert venue, the Tokyo Dome. The following year they announced the renaming of the band to X Japan in order to launch an international career with an American album release, however, this ultimately did not happen.|$|E
