25|$|As Lovell {{designed}} mausoleums, he came {{to realize}} that there were fundamental problems facing above-ground burial. It had been common for centuries for above-ground burial vaults to be <b>tightly</b> <b>sealed,</b> to prevent the leakage of fluids and the spread of nauseating odors (both generated by the decomposition of the human body) from vaults. <b>Tightly</b> <b>sealed</b> vaults, however, allowed decomposition gases to build up, causing vaults to violently rupture ("exploding vault syndrome") and scatter partly-decomposed remains inside the mausoleum. Lovell designed a solution, which involved building a ventilation system and drainage system behind the vaults. He applied for a patent, which was granted on October 23, 1917 (patent number 1,244,109).|$|E

25|$|Ethanol is hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} absorbs water vapor {{directly}} from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept <b>tightly</b> <b>sealed.</b> This high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} process start with mother rolls. First, the etched, roughened and pre-formed anode foil {{on the mother}} roll {{as well as the}} spacer paper and the cathode foil are cut to the required width. The foils are fed to an automatic winder, which makes a wound section in a consecutive operation involving three sequential steps: terminal welding, winding, and length cutting. In the next production step the wound section fixed at the lead out terminals is soaked with electrolyte under vacuum impregnation. The impregnated winding is then built into an aluminum case, provided with a rubber sealing disc, and mechanically <b>tightly</b> <b>sealed</b> by curling. Thereafter, the capacitor is provided with an insulating shrink sleeve film. This optically ready capacitor is then contacted at rated voltage in a high temperature post-forming device for healing all the dielectric defects resulting from the cutting and winding procedure. After post-forming, a 100% final measurement of capacitance, leakage current, and impedance takes place. Taping closes the manufacturing process; the capacitors are ready for delivery.|$|E

Savoury dishes include dumplings, which are made using a mixture of suet, flour and water rolled into balls that are added to stews during the final twenty minutes or so of cooking. In the savoury dish steak and kidney pudding, a bowl is lined with suet pastry, the meat is placed inside and a lid of suet pastry <b>tightly</b> <b>seals</b> the meat.

Downregulation of cldn 5 a in zebrafish showed a failure in organ laterality that resulted from malformed KV.

However, malformed KV lumen and defective heart laterality in cldn 5 a morphants were significantly rescued by exogenous cldn 5 a mRNA, suggesting that the tightness between the luminal epithelial cells is important for KV lumen formation.

Xylem pressure inducing 50 % loss of hydraulic conductance (P 50, a proxy for cavitation resistance) varied widely among species, from − 2. 9 to − 11. 3 MPa. The valve effect of the pit membrane, measured as a function of margo flexibility and torus overlap, explained more variation in cavitation-resistance than simple anatomical traits such as pit membrane, pit aperture or torus size. Highly cavitation resistant species exhibited both a high flexibility of the margo and a large overlap between the torus and the pit aperture, allowing the torus to <b>tightly</b> <b>seal</b> the pit aperture.
