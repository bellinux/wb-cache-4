The Lutz family owned the bar until 1954, when it was purchased by the Barisich family. Lilias Barisich, who shared ownership with her brothers after their parents handed it over to them, said of the bar and her mother's operating style: [...] "It's always been a homey place because my mom would kick people out if they acted different. She'd tell them they wouldn't act that way if they were invited <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>home</b> for dinner, {{so there was no}} call to act like that at the Lutz." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1900s, the Walker {{brothers}} became {{active in}} the Back-to-Africa movement. [...] In 1902, Fleetwood and Weldy established and edited a black-issues newspaper called The Equator. [...] Six years later, Fleetwood and Weldy published a 47-page book titled Our Home Colony: A Treatise on the Past, Present, and Future of the Negro Race in America. [...] Fleetwood's biographer, David Zang, has written that Fleetwood [...] "was effected by the political vigilance which his younger brother, Weldy, had brought to the black cause." [...] In the credits <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> Colony, Fleetwood was identified as the author, and Weldy was identified as [...] "General Agent," [...] though much {{of the book is}} written in the first-person plural. [...] In the book, the Walkers wrote: [...] "The only practical and permanent solution of the present and future race troubles in the United States is entire separation by Emigration of the Negro from America." [...] They added: [...] "The Negro race will be a menace and the source of discontent as long as it remains in large numbers in the United States. The time is growing very near when the whites of the United States must either settle this problem by deportation, or else be willing to accept a reign of terror such as the world has never seen in a civilized country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of August 6, Abdallahi {{announced}} that he was firing several senior army officers, and at 9:20a.m. he was seized from his home by members of the Presidential Security Battalion (BASEP for Bataillon de la sécurité présidentielle) in a military coup. Presidential spokesman Abdoulaye Mamadou Ba {{said in a statement that}} President Abdallahi, Prime Minister Waghef, and Interior Minister Mohamed Ould R'zeizim had been arrested by renegade senior army officers, unknown troops, and a group of generals, and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in Nouakchott.

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{marriage}} equality at the time Rustin and partner Walter Naegle took an unconventional step to solidify their partnership and protect their unification. In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union. Naegle explains, We actually had to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. They had to send a social worker <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>home.</b> When the social worker arrived, she had to sit us down to talk to us {{to make sure that this}} was a fit home.Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s, said [...] "I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality. That was rare in those days. Rare." ...|$|E
