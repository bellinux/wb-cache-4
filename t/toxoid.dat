5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus <b>toxoid</b> should be given if not up to date.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toxoid</b> {{vaccines}} {{are made}} from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. <b>Toxoid</b> vaccines {{are known for their}} efficacy. Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, Crotalus atrox <b>toxoid</b> is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{typically}} contain {{one or more}} adjuvants, used {{to boost}} the immune response. Tetanus <b>toxoid,</b> for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum. This presents the antigen {{in such a way}} as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus <b>toxoid.</b> People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed tetanus <b>toxoid</b> may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for a booster.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{papers in}} this series have shown that plain <b>toxoids</b> induced early primary {{antitoxin}} levels in women in New Guinea that {{were not significantly different}} from those induced by adsorbed <b>toxoids</b> but {{that at the end of}} 1 year the antitoxin levels differed significantly. Protective levels (not less than 0. 01 unit/ml) induced by adsorbed <b>toxoids</b> persisted for more than 3 years. Results of laboratory assays of the <b>toxoids</b> reported in this paper show that per total human immunizing dose, the plain <b>toxoids</b> had 72 or less international units (IU) whereas the adsorbed <b>toxoids</b> had approximately 200 IU. The international ”unitage” of these <b>toxoids</b> reflected the persistence of the human protective antitoxin level but not the early primary response. The assay results were in agreement with findings of other workers that the mouse as well as the guinea-pig may be satisfactory for potency assay of adsorbed <b>toxoids.</b> The need for determination of the international unitage of tetanus <b>toxoids</b> used in human studies and the confirmation of relationship of this value to persistence of antitoxin levels is emphasized...|$|R

40|$|Chemically {{detoxified}} bacterial toxins (<b>toxoids)</b> {{have been}} successfully used as vaccines {{for the prevention of}} many bacterial infectious diseases. Today, nontoxic derivatives of bacterial toxins can be obtained by mutagenesis of the toxin genes. These genetically inactivated toxins are superior to the classical <b>toxoids</b> both in safety and in immunogenicity and therefore they should replace the old <b>toxoids</b> in the existing vaccines. In addition, they represent a novel class of immunogens with unique properties, some of which may be used for innovative approaches to vaccination...|$|R

25|$|Tetanus <b>toxoid</b> can {{be given}} {{in case of a}} {{suspected}} exposure to tetanus. In such cases, it {{can be given}} with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin). It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} vaccines {{were developed}} to reduce the risks from live vaccines. These are subunit vaccines, consisting of specific protein antigens (such as tetanus or diphtheria <b>toxoid)</b> or recombinant protein components (such as the hepatitis B surface antigen).

25|$|The use {{of simple}} {{molecules}} such as toxoids for immunization tends {{to produce a}} low response by the immune system, and thus poor immune memory. However, adding certain substances to the mixture, for example adsorbing tetanus <b>toxoid</b> onto alum, greatly enhances the immune response (see Roitt etc. below). These substances are known as adjuvants. Several different adjuvants {{have been used in}} vaccine preparation. Adjuvants are also used in other ways in researching the immune system.|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} which confirms that cholera <b>toxoids</b> obtained by reaction of purified toxin with Formalin possess {{the ability to}} partially reactivate both in vivo and in vitro. At the same time, conditions are presented for the preparation of stable, antigenic cholera <b>toxoids</b> by reaction of purified toxin with glutaraldehyde. Treatment of purified cholera toxin with approximately 200 mol of glutaraldehyde per mol of toxin at pH 7. 8 reproducibly resulted {{in the preparation of}} <b>toxoids</b> which: (i) possessed less than 20 bluing doses per 100 μg; (ii) did not reactivate in vivo or in vitro; (iii) precipitated with, and neutralized antitoxin; (iv) elevated prolonged serum antitoxin in immunized rabbits; (v) protected immunized guinea pigs against toxin skin challenge; and (vi) lent themselves to enhanced antigenicity by means of an in situ adjuvant system which may be suitable for man. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular sieve chromatography of a series of glutaraldehyde-derived <b>toxoids</b> suggested that the reaction products consisted of monomeric and polymeric species and that the proportion of higher-molecular-weight species was determined by the relative concentrations of toxin and glutaraldehyde. The results suggested a relationship between complete and irreversible elimination of toxicity and the formation of higher-molecular-weight <b>toxoids...</b>|$|R
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most widespread pathogenic organisms in animals (Hatheway, 1990). This organism causes acute entero-toxaemia in ruminants such as cattle, sheep, goats and buffalos by proliferation in the intestine and production of several toxins such as alpha, beta, epsilon and tau (Chakrabarty et al., 1980; Al-Mashat and Taylor, 1983; Popoff, 1984; Worral et al., 1987; Radostits et al., 1994; Secasiu et al., 1997). Among the toxins, beta and epsi-lon exert the most lethal effects (El-Idrissi and Ward, 1992). Clostridial vaccines are used for immunization against enterotoxaemia in cattle, sheep and goats. Nev-ertheless, there are no either currently available vaccines or information on immunization for buffalos. In the present paper, to obtain information on validity in the use of clostridial beta and epsilon <b>toxoids</b> for immuniza-tion of buffalos we studied whether these <b>toxoids</b> induced protective humoral immune responses by measuring an-tibody responses to potent <b>toxoids.</b> The beta and epsilon <b>toxoids</b> of Clostridium perfrin-gens were recently developed by International Labora...|$|R
40|$|Co-vaccination with {{cellular}} pertussis vaccine down-regulates allergic sensitization to diphtheria and tetanus antigens. Using a murine model, {{we investigated}} whether vaccination with diphtheria/ tetanus <b>toxoids,</b> administered separately or simultaneously {{with the whole}} cell vaccine of Bordetella pertussis, inhibits subsequent allergen-induced immune and inflammatory responses. Methods: BALB/c-mice were vaccinated intracutaneously {{with a combination of}} diphtheria and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> or a combination of diphtheria and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> with a whole cell vaccine of Bordetella pertussis (three times, days - 21 to - 7) prior to systemic sensitization (days 1 - 14) and repeated airway challenges (days 28 - 30) with ovalbumin. Results: Compared to negative controls, systemic sensitization and airway allergen challenges induced high serum levels of allergen-specific IgE, predominant Th 2 -type cytokine production, airway inflammation and development of in vivo airway hyperreactivity. Vaccination with diphtheria and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> prior to sensitization suppressed IgE formation and development of eosinophilic airway inflammation. Co-vaccination with a whole cell pertussis vaccine inhibited allergen sensitization, airway inflammation and development of in vivo airway hyperreactivity. Prevention was due to an allergen-specific and general shift from a predominant Th 2 towards a predominant Th 1 immune response. Conclusion: Vaccination with diphtheria and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> alone or in combination with whole cell pertussis vaccine prior to allergen sensitization prevented allergen-induced Th 2 immune responses. Vaccine antigens may down-regulate allergic responses to a range of common allergens...|$|R
25|$|Research {{begun in}} the 1970s led to {{clinical}} trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in Helsinki, Finland, Uppsala, Sweden, Bahia, Brazil, and Santiago, Chile with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a tetanus <b>toxoid.</b> The women had previously had tubal ligations. In the trial the immune response was reversible and no significant health issues were found.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, C. tetani was {{isolated}} {{from a human}} victim, by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and {{could be used for}} prophylaxis and treatment. Tetanus <b>toxoid</b> vaccine was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} by vaccination with tetanus <b>toxoid.</b> The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years, and standard care practice in many places {{is to give the}} booster to any patient with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when he or she was last vaccinated, or if he or she has had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine.

25|$|Some diseases, such as tetanus, cause disease not by {{bacterial}} growth but by bacterial {{production of a}} toxin. Tetanus toxin is so lethal that humans cannot develop immunity to a natural infection, {{as the amount of}} toxin and time required to kill a person is much less than is required by the immune system to recognize the toxin and produce antibodies against it. However the tetanus toxin is easily denatured losing its ability to produce disease, but leaving it able to induce immunity to tetanus when injected into subjects. The denatured toxin is called a <b>toxoid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Formaldehyde {{is used to}} {{inactivate}} bacterial products for <b>toxoid</b> vaccines (vaccines that use an inactive bacterial toxin to produce immunity). It {{is also used to}} kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production. Urinary tract infections are also often treated using a derivative of formaldehyde (methenamine), a method often chosen because it prevents overuse of antibiotics and the resultant development of bacterial resistance to them. In an acid environment, methenamine is converted in the kidneys to formaldehyde, which then has an antibacterial effect in the urinary tract. Some topical creams, cosmetics, and personal hygiene products contain derivatives of formaldehyde as the active ingredients that prevent the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.|$|E
500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in the wallet, and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic blood pressure was 60 versus the normal 140, indicating {{that he was in}} shock, and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, tetanus <b>toxoid,</b> and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E
