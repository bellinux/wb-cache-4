He {{completed}} in 1941 his M.S. in Theoretical Physics {{under the supervision}} of Hendrik Anthony Kramers at Leiden University. For the remainder of World War II he survived by tutoring students in physics and mathematics. He was awarded a University of Chicago Fellowship that supported him to complete a Ph.D. in Mathematical Biology in 1951 {{under the supervision of}} the founder of Mathematical Biophysics and Mathematical Biology, Nicolas Rashevsky. Karreman was then selected as a consultant to Albert Szent-Györgyi at the Institute for Muscle Research, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole. To follow his interest in mathematics applied to biology, physiology, and medicine he went to Philadelphia in 1957, to take up the position of Senior Medical Research Scientist at the Eastern Research Center. He was appointed associate professor of physiology at the School of Medicine in the University of Pennsylvania, where he also worked at the Bockus Research Institute at the Graduate Hospital. He was promoted to Full Professor of Physiology at the same university in 1972, where he held this position until 1983, when he became the first Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Biology. His main research interests were many, but all were in related fields that included: mathematical biology and mathematical biophysics, membrane biophysics, photosynthetic mechanisms, quantum biochemistry and quantum biophysics, biological energy transfer, quantum biology, physiological irritability, mathematical and systems analysis of cardiovascular and other biosystems, cooperativity, <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena</b> in biomembranes, adsorption mechanisms at membrane surfaces and ion binding to biomembranes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVarious {{experimental}} {{investigations have}} shown a sharp transition between satisfiability and unsatisfiability of CNF formulas with L clauses over n variables as c=L/n is varied. For 2 -SAT {{it has been shown}} theoretically that a <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurs at the critical value c= 1. For 3 -SAT experimental results show a sharp transition near c= 4 but no such <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomenon</b> has already been proved. Noticing that the XOR-SAT problem (in which one uses the ‘exclusive or’ instead of the usual ‘or’) is a special case of satisfiability which is solvable in polynomial time as decision problem as well as counting problem leads to the natural question: is there a satisfiability threshold for XOR-SAT? In this paper, we answer this question in establishing a <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomenon</b> for XOR-SAT, with associated critical value c= 1. So, consider randomly generated XOR-CNF formulas F. We prove that F is satisfiable with probability 1 −o(1) whenever c 1 as n tends to infinity. Indeed, in following the nice terminology classification given by Erdös and Rényi for random graphs, we obtain much better: we exhibit a probability distribution function that gives a complete understanding of the transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability for random XOR-SAT formulas...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{formalism}} to study K ¯ K <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena</b> with resonances f 0, a 0 and K + K − atom (kaonium) included. The approach provides two possible scenarios for f 0 −a 0 mixing. Drastic interference patterns {{can be observed in}} K + K − electroproduction at CEBAF, pd → 3 HeX reaction, and N ¯ N annihilation. It is well known that there is an interesting sometimes controversial physics bearing upon the K ¯ K <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena</b> and the nature of f 0, and a 0 resonances. We try to get a different handle of these issues by constructing an effective Hamiltonian which describes ¯KK <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena,</b> f 0 and a 0 resonances, and kaonium [1, 2]. Consider reaction of the type a + b → X + M → π + π − + M with invariant mass of X being {{in the vicinity of the}} K ¯ K threshold(s).

40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the effect of}} isometric exercise (IE) intensity on the cardiovascular autonomic variables (CVAV), we assessed the continuous relationships between force and the high frequency power of RR intervals (HFRR), low to high frequency ratio (LFRR/HFRR) and low frequency power of systolic pressure (LFSP), estimated by a time-frequency distribution (TFD). Thirty five healthy subjects performed continuously increasing static handgrip (HG) and static leg extension (LE) until maximal force (MF). Main findings were: 1) strong correlations between %MF and lnHFRR; 2) <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena</b> around 65 %MF in %MF vs. LFSP and LFRR/HFRR relations; and 3) greater effects on CVAV of LE than HG (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract — Today, due to {{the vast}} amount of {{literature}} on largescale wireless networks, we have a fair understanding of the asymptotic behavior of such networks. However, in real world {{we have to face}} finite networks for which the asymptotic results cease to be valid. We refer to networks as being finite when the number of nodes is less than a few hundred. Here we study a model of wireless networks, represented by random geometric graphs. In order to address a wide class of the network’s properties, we study the <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Being extensively studied in the asymptotic case, the <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomena</b> occurs when a graph theoretic property (such as connectivity) of the network experiences rapid changes over a specific interval of the underlying parameter. Here, we find an upper bound for the threshold width of finite line networks represented by random geometric graphs. These bounds hold for all monotone properties of such networks. We then turn our attention to an important non-monotone characteristic of line networks which is the medium access (MAC) layer capacity, i. e. the maximum number of possible concurrent transmissions. Towards this goal, we provide an algorithm which finds a maximal set of concurrent non-interfering transmissions and further derive lower and upper bounds for the cardinality of the set. Using simulations, we show that these bounds serve as reasonable estimates for the actual value of the MAC-layer capacity.

40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that spatial coupling of individual low-density parity-check codes improves the belief-propagation {{threshold of the}} coupled ensemble essentially to the maximum a posteriori threshold of the underlying ensemble. We study the performance of spatially coupled low-density generator-matrix ensembles when used for transmission over binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. We show by means of density evolution that the <b>threshold</b> saturation <b>phenomenon</b> also takes place in this setting. Our motivation for studying low-density generator-matrix codes {{is that they can}} easily be converted into rateless codes. Although there are already several classes of excellent rateless codes known to date, rateless codes constructed via spatial coupling might offer some additional advantages. In particular, by {{the very nature of the}} <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomenon</b> one expects that codes constructed on this principle can be made to be universal, i. e., a single construction can uniformly approach capacity over the class of binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. We discuss some necessary conditions on the degree distribution which universal rateless codes based on the <b>threshold</b> <b>phenomenon</b> have to fulfill. We then show by means of density evolution and some simulation results that indeed codes constructed in this way perform very well over a whole range of channel types and channel conditions.
