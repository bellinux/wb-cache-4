5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal {{increase in speed}} {{at the cost of}} clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or <b>try</b> <b>using</b> PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to <b>try</b> <b>using</b> it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, the Mowatts {{decided to}} <b>try</b> <b>using</b> {{the boat to}} tow barges. Since no {{steamboat}} had previously been utilized in such a role, the proposal was widely greeted with scepticism, but in the first attempt, Henry Eckford pulled two barges from New York to Albany in 24 hours, a commercially viable time. The principle having been established, other steamboat owners quickly followed suit, and steam towboats soon became a commonplace. Henry Eckford herself would thereafter spend much of {{her career as a}} towboat. However, she also continued to carry passengers, and in 1826 the steamer's cabin was converted to passenger accommodation. By this time, the fare from New York to Albany had dropped to a dollar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We <b>tried</b> <b>using</b> {{several local}} and global {{features}} for the TRECVID 2011 instance search task. From last year’s experience, we understood that face features were effective for this task. So we <b>tried</b> <b>using</b> a well-known face recognition algorithm for this task, and obtained better results for certain topics. Unfortunately our runs included some bugs, so the results were worse than last year’s. Our best run ranked 25 th in 37 runs as regards the average precision result...|$|R
50|$|Alas, {{that success}} did not carry over. The Cubs <b>tried</b> <b>using</b> {{him as a}} starter in 1996, and that {{experiment}} failed—in 6 games (5 started), he posted a 6.38 ERA in 24 innings of work. He only struck out 13 while walking 14. They <b>tried</b> <b>using</b> him as a starter again in 1997, but that failed too. He went 0-1 in 8 innings of work, which totaled two games started. After his final major league game on April 22, 1997, Swartzbaugh stuck around in the minors until 1999.|$|R

50|$|With some {{badly damaged}} devices it {{is a good}} idea to use a utility such as ddrescue to make a backup. Then when you have a copy of the device, use gpart to guess the {{partitions}} on the copy. If it is successful, you can try writing them back to the device. You may find that when using ddrescue you get read errors because the device is damaged but if you can get the partitions readable with your copy then you can <b>try</b> <b>using</b> Mount (Unix) and retrieve the data from the copy.|$|E
