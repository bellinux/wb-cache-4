50|$|<b>Traditional</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> are taxes {{raised on}} behalf of the EU as a whole, principally import duties on goods brought into the EU. These are {{collected}} by the state where import occurs and passed on to the EU. States are allowed to keep a proportion of the revenue to cover administration (20%). The European Commission operates a system of inspectors to investigate the collection of these taxes in member states and ensure compliance with the rules. The effect of a state failing to collect these taxes is that other states will have to contribute more to the budget, so there is a potential conflict of interest {{on the part of the}} collecting authorities. Countries are liable to make good any loss of revenue due to their own administrative failure.|$|E

40|$|The debate {{concerning}} the customary use of indigenous wildlife has recently brought conservation {{into the arena}} of race relations and cross-cultural negotiation in New Zealand. Mâori people are reclaiming rights to harvest traditional food sources {{as part of a}} current project of cultural revival. Indigenous bird species, which form part of this traditional diet, are legally protected, and as such, a conflict has arisen between Mâori communities and (predominantly European) environmentalists. Effective conservation of indigenous bird populations requires a commitment by both Mâori and Pâkehâ alike to ensure the survival and flourishing of such birds and their habitats. Cooperation in conservation management is unlikely to occur if Mâori people are continually denied access to engage in traditional practices. Customary forms of conservation, within the cultural framework of healthy Mâori communities, can conceivably operate in association with modern conservation management. However, this will only become possible if Mâori people are able to engage in and control the use of their <b>own</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>resources,</b> thereby enhancing such communities and necessitating the conservation of cultural treasures...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious criticisms of the status quo with respect to the EU budget {{represents}} the lack of a link between the EU policy and the system of <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Strengthening the link between reaching smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the EU system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by introducing tax-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> could contribute to decrease the existing sustainability gaps in taxation in the European Union. This research demonstrates that the introduction of the Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base (hereinafter as C(C) CTB) could be an important contribution to close the existing sustainability gaps in tax regimes in the EU. To research the revenue potential of the C(C) CTB, a model based on a remittance system was designed. The system foresees the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> (resp. GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resource)</b> through the transfer of a part of the corporate tax revenues based on the C(C) CTB raised on the national level to the EU budget. The results of the research show that the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> would be able to fully replace the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource,</b> with the only exception of Cyprus. However, the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> cannot be considered to be a sufficient resource to fully replace the GNI-base <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> Therefore, we recommend C(C) CTB only in connection with the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> FairTa...|$|R

In the present form of 27 Member States the EU {{has become one of}} the most important integration groupings of the world which is full counterpart in relation to powers such as USA, Russia or China. The revenue side of the budget is the determining factor in all economic actors, whether states, communities, regions or supranational organizations. The volume of revenues is while respecting the principle of balanced budget a limit of expenditures. The subject of this paper is an analysis of the budget {{revenues of}} the European Union, its assessment and finding new ways and possibilities in the EU budget own resources. The own resources of the European Union is founded on four basic sources. The first is the so-called <b>traditional</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources,</b> which combine two of the sources. The first is benefits and other fees under the common market organization for sugar and the second source are duties.

Two alternative reforms are discussed, along with their possible advantages and drawbacks: 1) a simplified system based only on a resource related to gross national income; and 2) {{the introduction of new}} genuine <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and the possible elimination of some current <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The second option, which has long been called for by the European Parliament, is explored in further detail, with an overview of the potential candidates for new <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> analysed by the European Commission prior to its 2011 reform proposal.

40|$|Objective of {{doctoral}} thesis is to propose {{reform of the}} EU budget so that its revenues and expenditures follow the principles of theory of fiscal federalism, respecting the so far achieved level {{of economic and political}} integration. Normative theory of public finance is based on the notion of market failures that have to be solved by three basic functions of public finance: allocation, redistribution and stabilisation. Theory of fiscal federalism follows up with principles that should be respected when searching for the most suitable level of government to provide the three mentioned functions. Allocation function should be decentralised while stabilisation and redistribution function should be centralised. Still, these principles may be adjusted according to the character of integration grouping in question. The doctoral thesis assess to what extent do revenues and expenditures of the EU budget follow the three mentioned principles. Expenditures are assessed according to five criteria: stabilisation function, redistribution function, cross-border externalities, economies of scale and homogeneity of preferences. Based on assessment according to these criteria, the author recommends following changes in EU budget expenditures. Market related measures and direct payments together with expenditures of rural development policy related to enhancing {{the quality of life in}} rural areas and diversification of rural economy should be decentralised. Also the programme "Competitiveness and innovation" supporting small and medium-sized enterprises should be abolished. On the other hand, the reform proposal recommends to increase expenditures on research and development of European relevance, trans-European networks, protection of external frontiers, management of migration flows and development aid. The proposal also suggest to establish common defence policy financing common military research and development together with equipment and procurement. Another significant proposal suggests to establish an European unemployment fund working as an instrument of automatic stabilisation and direct redistribution of the EU budget. Expenditure needs of the reformed budget are expressed in mathematical model at the level of 322, 5 billions of euro, which represents 2, 63 % GNI of EU- 27 in 2007. Revenues were assessed according to these criteria: stabilisation function, vertical equity, horizontal equity, cross-boarder externalities and relation to EU policies. On the basis of the assessment, it was recommended to abolish the current own resource based on VAT. On the other hand, the <b>traditional</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and resource based on GNI meet the criteria of fiscal federalism. The author also assessed several alternative resources of EU budget. Of these, excise taxes on motor-fuel spirits for road and air transport and to lesser extent also the real VAT were recommended as most suitable for the EU budget...|$|E

40|$|Although  the  responsibility  for  realizing  the  Europe   2020  strategy  is  shared  between the EU and its 28 member states, {{the main}} {{criticism}} of the current EU budget relates {{to the lack of}} a link between the budget and Europe 2020  strategy.  Therefore a new  budget design as well as alternative revenue sources is currently explored within a  mid-term review. One of the possible candidates is a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT). To research FTT revenue potential, a model based on  a remittance system was designed. We analyse full or partial replacement of VAT- and GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by the transfer of the tax revenues from a FTT raised on a national level to the EU budget. The research reveals that FTT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> would be able to fully replace GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> only for some EU member states. However, the results also show that, from the EU 11 (28) perspective, the tax is sufficient to fully replace VAT- or GNI-contributions if levied on the EU 11 (28) level (not on the national level) as a direct payment to the EU budget without tracking the source Member State.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the EU financing reform, where the lump-sum tax is considered as an alternative source of revenue. The purpose of this study stems out of the current debate related to the EU budget reform, where tax-based own-resources are required to replace the current system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> of the EU budget. The novelty of this research arises from the evaluation of a hypothetical EU lump-sum tax as a future replacement of GNI and VAT-based EU budget own sources. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the potential of a lump-sum tax as a source of future EU funding. We consider lump-sum tax as an EU per capita charge applicable to all citizens of 28 EU member states. In order to assess the lump-sum tax potential we simulate five different lump-sum tax rates and compare the obtained yield to current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The results of the research show that a charge per capita in the EU does not have the capacity to fully replace GNI or VAT-based EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Therefore, we consider the EU per capita charge as a form of complementary source to fund the EU own budget, with no real potential to fully replace the current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R
