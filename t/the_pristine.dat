40|$|The {{resistance}} of several pristine and functional single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) deposited and dried on interdigitated electrode (IDE) chips was investigated {{to better understand}} how functional groups influence their resistivity. Without the external electrical field, the resistance was generally increased for the sulfonated and fluorinated SWNTs but not for COOH-SWNTs. With a 3 [*]V electric field applied during depositing, while no change in resistance was found for <b>the</b> purified <b>pristine</b> SWNTs, fluorinated SWNTs, COOH SWNTs, and Ni-SWNTs, {{a significant decrease in}} resistance was observed in sulfonated SWNTs and unpurified pristine SWNTs, which could be due to the alignment of SWNTs in an electric field. The alignment of the sulfonated SWNTs is most likely due to the charge of the sulfate functional group. It {{is interesting to note that}} the alignment was found in <b>the</b> unpurified <b>pristine</b> SWNTs but not in <b>the</b> purified <b>pristine</b> ones which have lessened resistivity. The lower resistivity in <b>the</b> purified <b>pristine</b> SWNTs may be due to the smaller number (< 5 %) of impurities. The significance of this research is that hydrophilic COOH-SWNTs could be a better candidate than <b>the</b> hydrophobic <b>pristine</b> SWNTs for being used in many applications, especially in polymer nanocomposites...|$|R

25|$|Because {{cities are}} so highly {{impacted}} by human activities, restoration to <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> {{state is not}} possible, however there are modifications {{that can be made}} to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the flood control and water supply services. Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured lawns, as is seen in the National Wildlife Federation’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), which were once endangered by pesticide use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced rock dove. The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.|$|E

500|$|Declines in {{amphibian}} {{populations were}} first widely {{recognized in the}} late 1980s, when a large gathering of herpetologists reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe. [...] Among these species, the Golden toad (Bufo periglenes) endemic to Monteverde, Costa Rica, featured prominently. [...] It {{was the subject of}} scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989. Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (Atelopus varius), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the loss}} of marine life, the initial burning of the oil and the {{successful}} removal of the bow section prevented {{what could have been}} a worse spill. Captain Mike Hall of the Coast Guard stated that [...] "at least 82 percent of the oil on board New Carissa never reached the wildlife or <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> shoreline of Oregon's coast". The environmental impact of the sinking of the bow section was thought to be minimized since it was towed out beyond the continental shelf, into very deep water. Any remaining oil on board is unlikely to have affected marine life since the low temperatures at the bottom of the ocean would have caused it to solidify.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} on the Rubber Soul era, subtitled The Enduring Beauty of Rubber Soul, John Kruth refers to [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] as a [...] "striking from the first listen" [...] kind of tune that [...] "transported Beatles fans north to <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> forests of Scandinavia". Kennack Womack praises how the song [...] "reinterprets a {{familiar}} theme, {{in this case the}} loss of 'love' (well represented in earlier songs such as 'Don't Bother Me' and 'Misery'), providing listeners with security yet challenging those inclined to acknowledge the standard treatment". Stephen J. Spignesi rates [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] at number 42 in his book 100 Best Beatles Songs: A Passionate Fan's Guide, reasoning it was [...] "the most clear-cut evidence that the Beatles as artists had grown restless, and were no longer content with what had been considered up until then to be traditional rock". Among other Beatles examiners, Ted Montgomery comments: [...] "Perhaps no other song in rock and roll history captures a feel and nuance more succinctly and powerfully on 2:05 than 'Norwegian Wood'".|$|E
500|$|As {{important}} as these improvements were, {{they could not}} compete {{with the impact of}} the railway. German economist Friedrich List called the railways and the Customs Union [...] "Siamese Twins", emphasizing their important relationship to one another. He was not alone: the poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote a poem in which he extolled the virtues of the Zollverein, which he began with a list of commodities that had contributed more to German unity than politics or diplomacy. Historians of the Second Empire later regarded the railways as the first indicator of a unified state; the patriotic novelist, Wilhelm Raabe, wrote: [...] "The German empire was founded with the construction of the first railway..." [...] Not everyone greeted the iron monster with enthusiasm. The Prussian king Frederick William III saw no advantage in traveling from Berlin to Potsdam a few hours faster, and Metternich refused to ride in one at all. Others wondered if the railways were an [...] "evil" [...] that threatened the landscape: Nikolaus Lenau's 1838 poem An den Frühling (To Spring) bemoaned the way trains destroyed <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> quietude of German forests.|$|E

500|$|Casting {{calls and}} auditions for Alien {{were held in}} both New York and London. With only seven human {{characters}} in the story, Scott sought to hire strong actors so he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual style. He employed casting director Mary Selway, {{who had worked with}} him on The Duellists, to head the casting in the United Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States. In developing the story, O'Bannon had focused on writing the Alien first, putting off developing the other characters. He and Shusett had intentionally written all the roles generically: they made a note in the script that explicitly states [...] "The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women." [...] This freed Scott, Selway, and Goldberg to interpret the characters as they pleased, and to cast accordingly. They wanted the Nostromos crew to resemble working astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summarised as [...] "truckers in space". According to Scott, this concept was inspired partly by Star Wars, which deviated from <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> future often depicted in science fiction films of the time.|$|E
500|$|This species {{lives in}} the eastern Himalayas, and has been {{reported}} in several scattered sites across Southeast Asia, in the northwest of Vietnam and in central Laos. Its range stretches west into the northeast of India, where it was reported seen near Darjeeling in West Bengal, but not since 1933. It is present in Bhutan, and in the Indian states of Sikkim (in the town of Rangpo), in Meghalaya (in the Khasi Hills), in Assam (in the Dima Hasao district), in the south of Arunachal Pradesh, and in Manipur and Nagaland. Its presence in Bangladesh is uncertain but it is found further west in the north of Burma, in Chin State (in the Chin Hills-Arakan Yoma montane forests), the Sagaing Region, in Kachin State and in Shan State. Data on the bird from Laos is erratic, but there are reports of sightings north of Phou Kobo, and of large numbers of the species wintering {{in the center of the}} country in <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> wilderness of Nakai–Nam Theun. There are also reports of sightings in the southeast of China’s Yunnan province, in northern Thailand and in northwestern Vietnam. Its residential and breeding range is estimated to cover [...]|$|E
500|$|In 2006, of 4,035 {{species of}} {{amphibians}} {{that depend on}} water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) {{were considered to be}} threatened. This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status. Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited <b>the</b> <b>pristine</b> Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size. Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased UVB radiation, [...] and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors. A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss. Emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis [...] and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.|$|E
