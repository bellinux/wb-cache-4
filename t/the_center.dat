5|$|<b>The</b> <b>center</b> is {{utilized}} {{to connect the}} College of Law and Willamette as a whole to the larger Salem community. In this capacity, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> houses several law school programs with community outreach aspects.

5|$|After passing {{midway between}} Key West and the Dry Tortugas, Tropical Storm Marco adopted a steady northward track and quickly intensified, {{reaching}} peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) on October 11, while still southwest of Englewood, Florida. <b>The</b> <b>center</b> {{of the storm}} continued on its off-shore parallel for another six hours after reaching its peak intensity, until it reached a position about sixmi (10km) west of Bradenton Beach; although <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the storm remained offshore, much of its circulation was over land. Initially the storm still was forecast to move ashore between Fort Myers and Sarasota. However, the cyclone continued its northward trajectory, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> remaining offshore, and it weakened to a tropical depression prior to making landfall near Cedar Key early on October 12.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of mass and the elevation of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
40|$|AbstractR. E. Moore (“Interval Analysis,” Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1966) {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> {{form for}} approximating the range tf(X) of a rational function f over X, where X {{is a real}} interval. H. Ratschek (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 17 (1980), 656 – 662), introduced centered forms of higher order. These are, in general, better approximations than <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> form. If f is a polynomial p, however, then <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> form and <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> form of higher order lead to the same approximation. This distinguished behavior of polynomials is investigated and it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> form is <b>the</b> best possible approximation of p̄(X), if <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> form is compared with all approximations of p̄(X) that include p̄(X) and depend on the same data of p as those needed in constructing <b>the</b> <b>centered</b> form...|$|R

5|$|As the {{depression}} drifted erratically, the system remained weak {{due to its}} large circulation and lack of deep convection near <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>The</b> <b>center</b> relocated to the south, closer to <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> An approaching upper-level trough lessened the shear over the system, allowing {{the depression}} to intensify into Tropical Storm Alex on August 1. The trough also caused Alex to increase its forward motion to the northeast. Deep convection continued to build over <b>the</b> <b>center</b> due to low shear and warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and Alex intensified into a hurricane on August 3 while located 75miles (120km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The cyclone continued to strengthen, and attained Category 2 status just hours after becoming a hurricane. The hurricane approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, coming within 11miles (16km) of Cape Hatteras later on the 3rd. The western portion of the eyewall passed over the Outer Banks, though <b>the</b> <b>center</b> remained offshore.|$|E

5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> Convection became displaced from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of circulation but the storm continued to intensify.
