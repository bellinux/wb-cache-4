5|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of Slavonia is {{a blend of}} historical influences, especially those {{since the end of the}} 17th century, when Slavonia started recovering from the Ottoman wars, and its traditional culture. Slavonia contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> Croatia, through art, writers, poets and art patronage. In traditional music, Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia, and the traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals, with prominence given to tamburica music and bećarac, a form of traditional song, recognized as an intangible {{cultural heritage}} by UNESCO. The cuisine of Slavonia reflects diverse influences—a blend of traditional and foreign elements. Slavonia is one of Croatia's winemaking areas, with Ilok and Kutjevo recognized as centres of wine production.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th century, prosperous patrician {{families}} of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized {{in comparison to}} {{most of the rest of}} Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Kraków and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the Polish Renaissance. Unable to form their own nationwide political class, many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize {{to a great extent}} {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Slavonia {{significantly}} contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> Croatia as a whole, both through {{works of}} artists and through patrons of the arts—most notable among them being Josip Juraj Strossmayer. Strossmayer {{was instrumental in the}} establishment of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, later renamed the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the reestablishment of the University of Zagreb. A number of Slavonia's artists, especially writers, made considerable contributions to Croatian culture. Nineteenth-century writers who are most significant in Croatian literature include Josip Eugen Tomić, Josip Kozarac, and Miroslav Kraljević—author of the first Croatian novel. Significant twentieth-century poets and writers in Slavonia were Dobriša Cesarić, Dragutin Tadijanović, Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić and Antun Gustav Matoš. Painters associated with Slavonia, who contributed greatly to Croatian art, were Miroslav Kraljević and Bela Čikoš Sesija.|$|E

5|$|Tripura {{is noted}} for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane {{are used to}} create an array of furniture, utensils, {{hand-held}} fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the state. Some local musical instruments are the sarinda, chongpreng (both string instruments), and sumui (a type of flute). Each indigenous community has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria dance during the Goria puja. Jhum dance (also called tangbiti dance), lebang dance, mamita dance, and mosak sulmani dance are other Tripuri dance forms. Reang community, the second largest scheduled tribe of the state, is noted for its hojagiri dance that is performed by young girls balanced on earthen pitchers. Bizhu dance is performed by the Chakmas during the Bizhu festival (the {{last day of the}} month of Chaitra in Hindu calendar). Other dance forms include wangala dance of the Garo people, hai-hak dance of the Halam branch of Kuki people, and sangrai dance and owa dance of the Mog. Alongside such traditional music, mainstream Indian musical elements such as Indian classical music and dance, Rabindra Sangeet are also practised. Sachin Dev Burman, a member of the royal family, was a maestro in the filmi genre of Indian music.|$|E
