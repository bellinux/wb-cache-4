Those same sources are silent on UB-14s whereabouts at the time, but information on UB-14 later shipment and arrival in the Mediterranean suggest that her initial launch and commissioning may have occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although <b>that</b> <b>pattern</b> was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E

500|$|Monteverdi employs {{specific}} musical {{devices to}} signify moods and situations. For example, triple metre signifies {{the language of}} love for Nerone and Ottone (unfulfilled in the latter case); forceful arpeggios are used to represent conflict; and the interlacing of texts, written as separate verses by Busenello, indicates sexual tension in the scenes with Nerone and Poppea, and escalates the discord between Nerone and Seneca. The technique of [...] "concitato genere"—rapid semiquavers sung on one note—is used to represent rage. Secret truths may be hinted at as, for example, when Seneca's friends plead with him to reconsider his suicide in a chromatic madrigal chorus which Monteverdi scholar Denis Arnold finds reminiscent of Monteverdi's Mantuan days, carrying a tragic power rarely seen in 17th century opera. This is followed, however, by a cheerful diatonic section by the same singers which, says Rosand, suggests a lack of real sympathy with Seneca's predicament. The descending tetrachord ostinato on which the final duet of the opera is built has been anticipated in the scene in which Nerone and Lucano celebrate Seneca's death, hinting at an ambivalence {{in the relationship between}} emperor and poet. According to Rosand: [...] "in both cases it is surely the traditional association of <b>that</b> <b>pattern</b> with sexual love that is being evoked." ...|$|E
500|$|The U.S. government's National Center for Health Statistics {{reported}} 33,736 {{motor vehicle}} traffic deaths in 2014. This exceeded {{the number of}} firearm deaths, which was 33,599 in 2014. According to another U.S. government office, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motor vehicle crashes on U.S. roadways claimed 32,744 lives in 2014 and 35,092 in 2015. (The National Center for Health Statistics may have different criteria for inclusion or a slightly different methodology from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report comparing 2015 to 2014 noted that fatalities increased from 2014 to 2015 in almost all segments of the population: passenger vehicle occupants, passengers of large trucks, pedestrians, pedalcyclists (commonly referred to as cyclists), motorcyclists, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, male/female, daytime/nighttime. Fatalities of drivers of large trucks remained unchanged. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration performed a regression analysis between monthly roadway fatalities and various possible explanatory variables over the five-year period 2011–2015. The strongest correlation was with vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which had a correlation of [...]80, followed by average monthly temperature, which had a correlation of [...]74, meaning that higher temperatures were associated with increased fatalities. Part {{of the reason for}} <b>that</b> <b>pattern</b> may be that more people are out walking and biking in the warmer months, and pedestrians and cyclists are often victims of collisions with motor vehicles. The report also suggests that there may be more vacation travel during warmer months. (It is not stated whether the analysis used annual vehicle miles traveled or monthly vehicle miles traveled.) Although not mentioned, motorcycle use, and therefore motorcyclist fatalities, may also increase in warmer months.|$|E

Resolution in CPD can be measured by bar charts of different numbers of white/black stripe cycles.
