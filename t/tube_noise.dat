This thesis is a first look into the field of piezoelectric tube actuators, intended {{to lay the groundwork for}} further research on the subject at NTNU. It details the construction of a laboratory setup for actuation and nanometer displacement measurement of a piezoelectric tube. Needed specifications are found and a mechanical setup is designed. Basic theory on piezoelectricity is presented, along with the setup and equipment used for the thesis. Several experiments are designed and conducted in order to identify the linear dynamics and nonlinear properties of the piezoelectric tube. The results are discussed and related to current literature. This includes the linear frequency responses from applied voltage to displacement of the piezoelectric <b>tube,</b> <b>noise</b> levels and nonlinear properties such as displacement creep and hysteresis. Generally, the results are found to closely match what has been found in similar research, although there are some notable differences, such as a somewhat smaller low frequency gain and a much lower resonant peak frequency of the system. Several possible explanations for these disparities are discussed. Both a capacitive sensor and a piezoelectric strain voltage sensor are utilized for measuring displacement. It is found that the capacitive sensor has a higher noise level but is more accurate at lower frequencies than the strain voltage sensor. The two measurements are then combined into an improved estimate of the displacement of the piezoelectric tube. </p...|$|E

This dissertation grapples with the historical conditions that gave rise to such a transformation: the studies of radio-wave propagation and the treatments of radio interferences in early twentieth-century America and Western Europe. The part on propagation examines the debate between the surface diffraction theory and the atmospheric reflection theory for long waves, the development of the ionic refraction theory for short waves, the evidential quests for the existence of the ionosphere, and the studies of the geomagnetic effects on propagation. The part on interferences focuses on the engineering efforts toward the characterization of atmospheric noise and signal-intensity fluctuations, the policies of radio-channel allocation for fighting man-made interference, and the scientific research into electronic <b>tube</b> <b>noise.</b> By the mid- 30 s, the results from these endeavors had considerably improved the quality of radio communication.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{investigation}} is made into the limitations {{to the accuracy}} of balance of bridge measuring circuits as a result of noise. Particular attention is focused on the capacitance bridge. The sources of noise considered arise in the bridge circuit and the detector amplifier. Noise from the source oscillator, particularly {{in the case of a}} frequency sensitive bridge is also of consequence. A survey of preamplifier types suitable for use with a capacitance bridge is made to find the one contributing the least noise. These preamplifiers comprise untuned, tuned and parametric amplifiers. Theoretical consideration of a mechanically driven capacitor in a parametric up-converter amplifier indicates its usefulness as a low frequency amplifier. Investigations were made to determine the sources of noise in a vacuum tube preamplifier and relatively simple methods evolved for the determination of vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>noise</b> performance at low frequencies. The indicator displaying the bridge unbalance was considered in regard to its performance at small signal to noise ratios. A particular indicator is considered and the performance of the human operator in balancing a bridge using this unit is studied. For comparison an ideal detector comprising a phase sensitive detector followed by a resistance capacitance filter and perfect integrator is considered. A determination is made of the ultimate sensitivity of a bridge measuring system when using this type of indicator. The sources which contribute to the noise of the oscillator driving the bridge are discussed and a method for the reduction of the harmonic frequencies of the source at the output of a frequency sensitive bridge is described.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) diffuse optical {{tomography}} {{is known}} to be a nonlinear, ill-posed and sometimes under-determined problem, where regularization is added to the minimization to allow convergence to a unique solution. In this work, a generalized least-squares (GLS) minimization method was implemented, which employs weight matrices for both data-model misfit and optical properties to include their variances and covariances, using a computationally efficient scheme. This allows inversion of a matrix that is of a dimension dictated by the number of measurements, instead of by the number of imaging parameters. This increases the computation speed up to four times per iteration in most of the under-determined 3 D imaging problems. An analytic derivation, using the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury identity, is shown for this efficient alternative form and it is proven to be equivalent, not only analytically, but also numerically. Equivalent alternative forms for other minimization methods, like Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) and Tikhonov, are also derived. Three-dimensional reconstruction results indicate that the poor recovery of quantitatively accurate values in 3 D optical images can also be a characteristic of the reconstruction algorithm, along with the target size. Interestingly, usage of GLS reconstruction methods reduces error in the periphery of the image, as expected, and improves by 20 % the ability to quantify local interior regions in terms of the recovered optical contrast, as compared to LM methods. Characterization of detector photomultiplier <b>tubes</b> <b>noise</b> has enabled the use of the GLS method for reconstructing experimental data and showed a promise for better quantification of target in 3 D optical imaging.

40|$|The {{application}} of the Hershcel-Quincke (HQ) <b>tube</b> as a <b>noise</b> reduction device for one-dimensional plane-wave sound fields has been studied in great detail in previous years. In this thesis, an analytical technique is developed to investigate {{the potential of the}} HQ tube concept to control higher-order duct modes. This analytical method involves modeling the tube-duct interfaces as finite piston sources, which couple the acoustic field inside the main duct with the acoustic field within the HQ tube(s). The acoustic field within the HQ tube is modeled as plane-waves and the acoustic field within the main duct is modeled by expanding the sound field in terms of the higher-order modes. This model is then used to investigate the noise reduction mechanisms behind the attenuation of higher-order modes. These mechanisms involve both the reflection of the incident wave as well as the reconstruction and recombination of the modal content of the incident disturbance into other modes. The effects of the modal content of the disturbance along with the HQ tube geometric parameters, such as tube axial position, length, distance between interfaces, and cross-sectional area, are studied with respect to the frequencies of attenuation and the reduction obtained.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty subjects (29 male, 21 female; 26 - 92 years; mean body mass index (BMI; 26. 9) with abdominal multiphasic computed tomography were included. Abdominal diameters and circumferences were derived from anteroposterior and lateral scout radiographs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on three problem areas {{in the performance of}} inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source. The noise characteristics of aerosols produced by ICP nebulizers are investigated. A laser beam is scattered by aerosol and detected by a photomultiplier <b>tube</b> and the <b>noise</b> amplitude spectrum of the scattered radiation is measured by a spectrum analyzer. Discrete frequency noise in the aerosol generated by a Meinhard nebulizer or a direct injection nebulizer is primarily caused by pulsation in the liquid flow from the pump. A Scott-type spray chamber suppresses white noise, while a conical, straight-pass spray chamber enhances white noise, relative to the noise seen from the primary aerosol. Simultaneous correction for both spectral interferences and matrix effects in ICP atomic emission spectrometry (AES) can be accomplished by using the generalized standard additions method (GSAM). Results obtained with the application of the GSAM to the Perkin-Elmer Optima 3000 ICP atomic emission spectrometer are presented. The echelle-based polychromator with segmented-array charge-coupled device detectors enables the direct, visual examination of the overlapping lines Cd (1) 228. 802 nm and As (1) 228. 812 nm. The slit translation capability allows a large number of data points to be sampled, therefore, the advantage of noise averaging is gained. An ICP is extracted into a small quartz vacuum chamber through a sampling orifice in a water-cooled copper plate. Optical emission from the Mach disk region is measured with a new type of echelle spectrometer equipped with two segmented-array charge-coupled-device detectors, with an effort to improve the detection limits for simultaneous multielement analysis by ICP-AES...|$|R
40|$|To prospectively {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} using Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) for reducing radiation and iodine contrast dose in abdominal CT patients with high BMI values. 26 patients (weight > 65 kg and BMI ≥ 22) underwent abdominal CT using GSI mode with 300 mgI/kg contrast material as study group (group A). Another 21 patients (weight ≤ 65 kg and BMI ≥ 22) were scanned with a conventional 120 kVp <b>tube</b> voltage for <b>noise</b> index (NI) of 11 with 450 mgI/kg contrast material as control group (group B). GSI images were reconstructed at 60 keV with 50 %ASIR and the conventional 120 kVp images were reconstructed with FBP reconstruction. The CT values, standard deviation (SD), signal-noise-ratio (SNR), contrast-noise-ratio (CNR) of 26 landmarks were quantitatively measured and image quality qualitatively assessed using statistical analysis. As for the quantitative analysis, the difference of CNR between groups A and B was all significant except for the mesenteric vein. The SNR in group A was higher than B except the mesenteric artery and splenic artery. As for the qualitative analysis, all images had diagnostic quality and the agreement for image quality assessment between the reviewers was substantial (kappa = 0. 684). CT dose index (CTDI) values for non-enhanced, arterial phase and portal phase in group A were decreased by 49. 04 %, 40. 51 % and 40. 54 % compared with group B (P = 0. 000), respectively. The total dose and the injection rate for the contrast material were reduced by 14. 40 % and 14. 95 % in A compared with B. The use of GSI and ASIR provides similar enhancement in vessels and image quality with reduced radiation dose and contrast dose, compared {{with the use of}} conventional scan protocol...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{prosecution of}} the research and process development on polonium, radium, actinium, waste disposal, and alpha-neutron sources {{requires the use of}} a wide variety of instrumental techniques such as: alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron counters and survey meters; emission, absorption, and mass spectroscopy: x-ray and electron diffraction; microbalances; and calorimeters. The complex and kaleidoscopic aspects of our research program require; (1) The application of standard instruments and techniques to a variety of problems; (2) The development of new techniques for the use of standard instruments; and (3) The development of new or improved Instruments. The sum of the above three categories constitutes the field of supporting research. The amplifier for counting pulses of wide dynamic range which was developed for counting beta particles in the presence of alphas has operated so satisfactorily that it has been decided to attempt to adopt it for neutron counting. Substantial improvement at medium counting rates has already been obtained but results at high counting rates are not as satisfactory. The development of a survey meter for monitoring fast neutrons has been under way for sometime. The attainment of higher efficiency has been attempted by the use of a dual-chambered counter tube. The tube operates with a filling of methane gas at two atmospheres pressure. The achievement of leak-proof seals and highest purity methane has been under investigation as their necessity has been indicated by tests. The development of a scintillation counter for surveying and measuring low levels of alpha activity has been continued. Recent efforts have been directed towards determining the correct voltages to be applied to the photomultiplier tube in order to operate under optimum conditions. Recent tests of the coincidence counter to detect scintillations in water containing alpha-active waste material have indicated the necessity of obtaining photomultiplier <b>tubes</b> with low <b>noise</b> level and a better regulated, noise-free power supply...|$|R
40|$|Eddy current testing (ECT) is a {{conventional}} inspection method of heat exchanger tubes. Many types of probes {{have been developed}} depending on such tube conditions as tube shapes and materials. However, the vicinity of a tube expansion is still a difficult area to inspect. This is {{because there is a}} step-shape variation circumferentially on the inside surface and there is a ferromagnetic tube sheet around the outside surface so that large noise is observed. A high signal to noise ratio (S/N) is required to inspect the area because fatigue cracks can occur near the tube expansion. In this study, we chose test pieces having an outside circumferential notch with a depth of 20 % tube thickness (20 %t) and set the target of the detection performance at S/N = 3. In order to realize this target, we utilized the difference of eddy current flows at a local notch and a tube expansion, and devised a new arrangement for exciting and pick-up coils. In our arrangement, the pick-up coil having a winding direction along the circumference is placed at the center of two exciting coils. The exciting coils induce an eddy current flow in the axial direction at the center and the pick-up coil can detect only a circumferential component. By using this probe, large noise having an axial component is suppressed and only a notch signal having a circumferential component can be detected. In order to confirm the probe performance, we compared it with a general bobbin type probe. In the sensitivity evaluation for an outside circumferential notch with 20 %t, the signal amplitude was improved 5. 7 times. In the noise evaluation test using a test piece with <b>tube</b> expansion, the <b>noise</b> amplitude was decreased 1 / 8 times. We could successfully detect the outside circumferential notch (20 %t) near a tube expansion at S/N= 3. 5, verifying the detection performance...|$|R
