40|$|Data {{collected}} on significant innovations in the UK since 1945 show {{that more than}} half come from firms with more than 10, 000 employees, and that their share is increasing. Most innovations come from firms in the same or closely related product groups, except in instruments and mechanical engineering where user firms make a significant contribution. A high proportion of innovations produced in <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>product</b> groups (chemicals, mechanical engineering, electronics) are used {{in a wide variety of}} other sectors. This data on significant innovations is on the whole consistent with other data on innovative activities. The unreasonably low proportion of the innovations identified as of foreign origin probably reflects the importance of imitation through independent redevelopment as a source of technology imports. If so, technology imports and R & D are complementary activities, rather than substitutes. ...|$|E
40|$|Achievement and {{sustenance}} {{of growth}} are essential themes in organizational literature. In our paper, we develop models using systems thinking approach {{to understand how}} firms achieve and sustain growth in a <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>product</b> domain. We augment these to explain the possible impact of a disruptive technological innovation. We use enterprise software industry as the context where SAP has been acknowledged as the market leader. We find that product differentiation and learning effects helped SAP establish itself, and this growth was further sustained through networks and complementors. Introducing cloud computing as the disruptive innovation, we explain its impact on a firm. Analysis reveals that for {{the next wave of}} growth to occur, and to tap into newer markets, it would be imperative for SAP to create attractive cloud based offerings. We also discuss how the model can be enhanced by considering competitor dynamics.

40|$|The three {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} study {{issues related to}} <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>product</b> pricing, Information Technologies (IT) workforce utilization through an emerging online channel, and IT vendor selection in online markets, respectively. ^ The first essay considers pricing issues of sequential versions of IT-intensive products. Pricing overlapping generations of an IT product line is a complicated task. The manufacturer of IT-intensive products must decide on prices {{and the extent of}} innovation in order to maximize profit by making both versions attractive to heterogeneous consumers. I propose an analytical model to examine the effect of product obsolescence and consumer time preferences on pricing decisions for IT-intensive products such as software and computer hardware. Optimal pricing strategies for overlapping generations are derived, and the nature of equilibrium solutions is examined. The presented analytical model can be also used to measure consumer time preference for a given product. Intel 2 ̆ 7 s pricing practice is analyzed, using Intel 2 ̆ 7 s microprocessor pricing data. ^ The second essay proposes a strategic use of reverse online auctions, a typical e-lancing tool, to assign jobs to workers, for yield management from the IT service provider 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. Given the fixed capacity of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s IT workforce, the nature of IT projects, demand uncertainty, and growing competition among IT vendors, IT service firms cannot avoid occasionally holding some excess workforce. Markov decision process theory is employed to model an IT service firm which receives projects through two channels: a conventional procurement channel and an online auction spot market such as Elance Online (www. elance. com). The proposed model provides optimal online auction participation policies to maximize the expected total discounted profit. ^ The third essay investigates IT vendor selection determinants in online markets. Given the potentially severe information asymmetries in online service markets, the work identifies credible signal devices for high quality vendors, which might serve as a driver for the continuous growth of this type of market. The empirical results suggest that clients rely on both average feedback rating and the cumulated quantity of the feedback ratings as credible signals of high quality vendor. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the role of}} FDI in technology transfer and learning, particularly by transnational corporations. It highlights the important role that such corporations can play in the transfer of technology, but emphasizes that technology transfer should be maximized and complemented by appropriate country policies. It identifies key trends {{in the global economy}} to demonstrate that <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> have the fastest-increasing share of growing world trade, so developing countries should develop capabilities in <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> It further identifies the notable success achieved by South-East Asian economies. The article also discusses the role of FDI, research and development, licensing, information and communication technology infrastructure and human capital as key structural determinants of industrial competitiveness, which technology policy should focus on. The article considers foreign direct investment-targeting strategies, and argues that there is a prominent role for policy intervention. On the basis of its evaluation of the country case studies, the article considers the strategies used successfully to build domestic capabilities, providing a broad set of policy options from which to choose from. However, there is no single path to competitive success. The article emphasizes the variety of diverse paths followed by different countries...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{external}} trade of industrialized countries {{is dominated by}} <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> There is, however, a considerable discrepancy between empirical findings and their theoretical explanation. Therefore the study focusses on the teoretical work of economic theory which helps to explain these phenomena. A general distinction is made between neoclassical and evolutionary approaches, each of them discussed {{from the perspectives of}} growth teory and international trade. The review reveals the great progress economic theory has went through during the last decade but also points to the still existing indadequacies in theory. The last section tries to connect contemporary theory to well-developed empirical research-methods...|$|R

The paper finds a long run cointegrating relationship between public and private R&D and a bi-directional causality where they complement each other. The Government of the ROC should continue to invest not only to stimulate private R&D but also to enable the country to compete more globally in <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is much {{evidence}} that {{intellectual property rights}} (IPR) protection stimulates trade flows between countries. Yet less is known whether this effect is stronger for <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> Using data for 119 countries over the period 1976 – 2010, this paper shows {{that the impact of}} IPR protection on manufacturing imports is significantly stronger for products with greater technology embodiment, as measured by their R&D intensity. An increase in the level of IPR protection leads to 22 per cent faster increase in the value of imports of products at the 90 th percentile of R&D intensity than products at the 10 th percentile...|$|R
40|$|Stylised {{evidence}} on trade, {{total factor productivity}} (TFP) and skill intensity of the labour force is presented. Features emerging as salient are: growing trade in <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> from the industrialised nations to the relatively laggard nations leads to embodied technology diffusion; the technology-intensive sectors have larger shares of skilled workers; countries experiencing TFP growth usually {{have higher levels of}} educational attainment; also, the skilled labour payment share for a sector is positively associated with that sector's regional trade share. These facts together help explain why endowment of more skilled labour facilitates absorption of technology ferried via trade. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} the Romanian trade with EU, based on a variety of indicators: Finger similarity index, Hirschmann concentration index, trade development index, revealed comparative advantage, intra-industry trade. The paper finds that the learning effect occurred in trade with EU, that the trade structure has been witnessing certain transformations, and that specialization appears to increase in <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> in the fields dominated by the foreign capital; however, export concentration is rather high, while natural resource-intensive and low skilled labor-intensive products face severe competitive pressures. The results suggest that Romania’s foreign trade-driven convergence to EU is not spectacular, but it is happening at its own speed...|$|R

Also, URE has declined recently, and has been replaced by other forms of university-industry links, such as collaborative research between universities and firms, education and training, information exchange between universities and firms, academic research, transferring proprietary technology (patent licensing), university science parks and spin-off companies (Eun 2009). In addition, many Western companies have learnt how to protect their R&D operations by themselves in the Chinese environment (Zhao 2006; Keupp et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|This paper maps out {{the recent}} {{manufactured}} export patterns of developing countries, {{using a new}} and detailed classification by technological levels. It argues that export structures, being path-dependent and difficult to change, {{have important implications for}} growth and development. Low-technology products (which have the least beneficial learning and spillover effects) tend to grow the slowest, and <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> (which have the most beneficial effects) the fastest in world trade. East Asia dominates the developing country scene, with 70 % of total manufactured exports, and its role rises over time. There is also high and rising concentration at the national level. The technological specialization of different regions and the leading exporters differ greatly, as do the strategies used to achieve competitiveness. Received trade theory cannot explain these patterns without considering learning processes and the policies used to promote them. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} organization of Chinese exports, their comparative advantage, and technological structure, using the statistical data of Chinese foreign trade in recent years. The result demonstrates that labor-intensive products form the largest ratio of Chinese exports and also those that have the comparative advantage. The proportion of skill- and <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> is growing larger compared with the gross amount of general Chinese exports and among products with comparative advantage. However, compared with the average level in the world, the technology contained in Chinese exports is lower, and the growth of exports is mainly one of quantitative expansion. This article posits that the implementation of the strategy of sustainable development of foreign trade guided by competitive advantage is the necessary path for promoting the international competitive capacity of Chinese foreign trade products and obtaining more comparative interests. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} share of direct and {{indirect}} services trade in Japanese trade between 1985 and 1995, using data from Japanese input-output tables. The empirical analysis reveals that {{the share of}} R&D services in total services trade has been much higher throughout the period than the share of other services. The contribution of school education services gradually increased from 1985 to 1995, while that of financial services declined. These results indicate that Japan increasingly exported <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> during the period, moving away from goods intensive in financial services to those intensive in educational services. After the bubble economy burst, exports of financial services declined and Japanese banking and insurance companies rapidly withdrew from overseas markets. Financial firms in Japan lack international competitiveness. Although structural reforms have been under way in some services sectors, the analysis in this paper suggests that greater reform is needed, especially in the financial sector. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a panel data {{approach}} {{to analyze the}} determinants of high-technology exports in selected OECD countries between the years 1989 to 2015. We used High-technology exports (current US$) as dependent variable and FDI (foreign direct investment), patent application of residents, GDP growth rate and Gross capital formation - % of GDP as explanatory variables. The export structure of countries is increasingly moving towards <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> such as ICT (information, communication technology), aerospace, computing and office equipment, electronic, chemical products, pharmaceutical electrical machinery. The Export structure had {{an important role in}} the economic growth theories of many countries since the 1960 s, as export growth has been associated with faster productivity and GDP growth. We aimed to find out the relationship between the high-technology exports and explanatory variables which we listed for selected 14 OECD countries (Canada, Denmark Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Korea, Netherland, Norway Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, UK, USA) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} two-country model of {{endogenous}} innovation and imitation {{in order to}} study the interactions between these two processes. Firms in the North race {{to bring out the}} next generation of a set of <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> Each product potentially can be improved a countably infinite number of times, but quality improvements require the investment of resources and entail uncertain prospects of success. In the South entrepreneurs invest resources in order to learn the production processes that have been developed in the North. All R&D investment decisions are made by forward-looking, profit-maximizing entrepreneurs. The steady-state equilibrium is characterized by constant aggregate rates of innovation and imitation. We study how these rates respond to changes in the sizes of the two regions and to policies in each region to promote learning.

40|$|Operating {{in highly}} {{competitive}} environments, high-tech firms leverage capital-intensive facilities, <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> and computer applications to earn competitive advantages. Doing so requires employees perform {{tasks that are}} relatively more complex in comparison with other industry sectors. Employee job satisfaction, a surrogate measure of organizational effectiveness/performance, is an important management index for practitioners and researchers. However, the impact that task value and goal orientations, as perceived by employees during task execution, have on individual and organizational effectiveness/performance has not received sufficient attention {{in the context of}} high-tech firms. This study integrated two theories, expectancy-value and achievement goal, to explore the effect of task value and goal orientation on high-tech employee job satisfaction. After surveying 156 respondents in six Taiwan-based multinational high-tech manufacturers, results show that task value and goal orientation affect employee job satisfaction in the high-tech sector positively. Findings provide guidance to managers for improving employee job satisfaction and in-depth insights for researchers interested to test or further develop organizational development theories...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} quarter century, the Asian Pacific region has {{experienced}} rapid economic growth characterized by rapid industrialization. Not only Asian newly industrialized economies (NIEs) but also many Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries and China have shown a substantial rise in the manufacturing sector as a percentage share of GDP or total exports. These facts imply that the structure of comparative advantage of each coun-try and thus the pattern of specialization {{in the region have}} changed over time. In fact, for example, Taiwan and Korea have increasingly penetrated Japan’s domestic market for capital and <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> and two-way trade in manufactured products between Japan and ASEAN and between Ja-pan and China has increased substantially. The share of manufactured prod-ucts in Japan’s total imports from ASEAN- 4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phil-ippines, and Thailand) has risen from 6 percent in 1980 to 14 percent in 1987 and 23 percent in 1989.

40|$|In {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment, high-tech firms utilize capital-intensive facilities, <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> and computer applications for gaining competitive advantages. It makes employees acquire more knowledge to perform more complex tasks. This has resulted in an increasing demand for organizations to implement knowledge management systems (KMS) for employees to steer organizational learning in the new era of knowledge-based economy. However, prior empirical examinations on factors influencing KMS success are not sufficient, particularly in the high-tech context. This study formulates and empirically tests a theoretical model to explain these factors and how they affect KMS success. Results from a sample of 141 employees selected from four high-tech semiconductor manufacturing firms provide us a more comprehensive understanding about how benefits, self-produced, and costs factors (i. e., reward, computer self-efficacy, and perceived power security) affect KMS success. It {{can be seen that}} reward and perceived power security have both direct and indirect effects on user satisfaction and intention to use KMS through perceived usefulness and ease of use. Moreover, computer self-efficacy influences user satisfaction and intention to use KMS through perceived usefulness and ease of use. Besides providing directions for development and testing of knowledge management theories, these findings will be valuable to practitioners...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{diversification}} of South Africa’s exports over the period 1994 to 2012. A decomposition of export growth shows that exports of non-fuel primary commodities as well as medium-skill and <b>technology-intensive</b> manufactured <b>products</b> increased. The largest decrease was in the export of resource-intensive manufactures. These changes reflect South Africa’s endowment of relatively low levels of physical and human capital. The analysis shows that export products that are further from the country’s comparative advantage, make smaller contributions to growth in the intensive margin. It clearly shows the challenge of sustainably diversifying the export basket...|$|R
40|$|We analyse natural {{resource}} use dynamics in the Mexican economy {{during the last}} three decades. Despite low and uneven economic growth, the extraction and use of materials in the Mexican economy has continuously increased during the last 30 Â years. In this period, population growth rather than economic growth was the main driving force for biophysical growth. In addition, fundamental changes have taken place in the primary sectors, in manufacturing, and in household consumption and these are reflected in an increasing emphasis on the use of fossil fuels and construction materials. Mexico's economy has been strongly influenced by international trade since the country commenced competing in international markets. In the 1970 s, Mexico mainly exported primary resources. This pattern has changed and manufactured goods now have a much greater importance due to a boom in assembling industries. In contrast with other Latin American countries, Mexico has achieved a diversification of production, moving towards <b>technology-intensive</b> <b>products</b> and a better mix in its export portfolio. However, crude oil exports still represent the single most important export good. Mexico's material consumption is still well below the OECD average but is growing fast and the current resource use patterns may well present serious social and environmental problems to the medium and long-term sustainability of Mexico's economy and community. Information on {{natural resource}} use and resource productivity could provide valuable guidance for economic policy planning in Mexico.

40|$|In this paper, role of {{international}} trade in economic development is discussed, both {{from the perspective of}} theoretical development and empiricism. In particular, it revisits theories pertaining to intra-industry and inter-industry trade and presents evidences of resilience in intra-industry trade. With globalization, trade in <b>technology-intensive</b> and manufactured <b>products</b> has increased intra-industry trade. Review of the theoretical and empirical literature reveals that this kind of trade is explained by variations in taste patterns, diversified preference structure, scale economies, technological change, and income level, amongst other things. After discussing computational issues related to level of aggregation of industry for measuring the extent of such trade, using Global Trade Analysis Project's (GTAP) database, we provide recent measures of Grubel-Lloyd Intra-industry trade indexes for the world economies. It shows that a country's intra-industry trade is growing in volume especially with fragmentation of production process. Also, we observe that burgeoning volume of intra-industry trade is positively correlated with: (i) per capita GNP; (ii) trade integration; (iii) share of manufacturing exports in total exports; (iv) technology intensiveness of the production process; (v) variety-seeking demand patterns. ...|$|R
