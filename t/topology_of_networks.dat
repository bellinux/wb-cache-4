Such connectivity of nodes decide the <b>topology</b> <b>of</b> <b>networks,</b> which {{has an effect on}} robustness of network, the attribute discussed above. If the number of links between the hubs is the same as would be expected by chance, we refer to this network as Neutral Network. If hubs tend to connected to each other while avoiding linking to small-degree nodes we refer to this network as Assortative Network. This network is relatively resistant against attacks, because hubs form a core group, which is more reduntant against hub removal. If hubs avoid connecting to each other while linking to small-degree nodes, we refer to this network as Disassortative Network. This network has a hub-and-spoke character. Therefore, if we remove the hub in this type of network, it may damage or destroy the whole network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many systems require {{information}} about the <b>topology</b> <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> on the Internet, for purposes like management, efficiency, testing of new protocols and so on. However, ISPs usually do not share the actual topology maps with outsiders. Consequently, many systems have been devised to reconstruct the <b>topology</b> <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> on the Internet from publicly observable data. Such systems rely on traceroute to provide path information, and attempt to compute the network topology from these paths. However, traceroute has the problem that some routers refuse to reveal their addresses, and appear as anonymous nodes in traces. Previous research {{on the problem of}} topology inference with anonymous nodes has demonstrated that it is at best NP-complete. We prove a stronger result. There exists no algorithm that, given an arbitrary trace set with anonymous nodes, can determine the topology of the network that generated the trace set. Even the weak version of the problem, which allows an algorithm to output a âsmall â set of topologies such that the correct topology is included in the solution set, is not solvable: there exist trace sets such that any algorithm guaranteed to output the correct topology outputs at least an exponential number of networks. We show how to construct such a pathological case even when the network is known to have exactly two anonymous nodes. ...|$|E

Rather than investigate the evolution of overall complexity, here we investigate the evolution of <b>topology</b> <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> in the Polyworld artificial life system. Our investigation encompasses both the actual structure of neural networks of agents in this system, and logical or functional networks inferred from statistical dependencies between nodes in the networks. We find interesting trends across several topological measures, which together imply a trend of more integrated activity across the networks (with the networks taking on a more âsmall-world â character) with evolutionary time. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract.
