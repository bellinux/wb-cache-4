[...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible."

Yet, the access to reconstruction funds has significantly heterogeneous effects on impact: it strongly raises non-durable consumption by households with low liquidity and bank debt (the 'wealthy-hand-to-mouth'); it makes no difference for liquid households. Consistently, in either group, consumption is insensitive to transfer funds that accrue directly to firms...|$|R

[...] Very rarely, {{at the end of the}} match it would become obvious that one image was different for the two players. One speculation is that this was simply an error, while another is that it was a test to see how quickly people would pass when their descriptions did not match.

40|$|Integrability of {{classical}} strings in the BTZ black hole enables {{the construction and}} study {{of classical}} string propagation in this background. We first apply the dressing method to obtain classical string solutions in the BTZ black hole. We dress <b>time</b> <b>like</b> geodesics in the BTZ black hole and obtain open string solutions which are pinned on the boundary at a single point and whose end points move on <b>time</b> <b>like</b> geodesics. <b>These</b> strings upon regularising their charge and spins have a dispersion relation {{similar to that of}} giant magnons. We then dress space like geodesics which start and end on the boundary of the BTZ black hole and obtain minimal surfaces which can penetrate the horizon of the black hole while being pinned at the boundary. Finally we embed the giant gluon solutions in the BTZ background in two different ways. They can be embedded as a spiral which contracts and expands touching the horizon or a spike which originates from the boundary and touches the horizon. © 2013 SISSA, Trieste, Italy...|$|R

50|$|Like skateboarding in its infancy, carveboarding {{seeks to}} give some {{specific}} sensations from surfing. These are also found in some practices of snowboarding (which is no surprise given {{the history of the}} latter). That is why today carveboards are sold on the quality of their emulation of surfing and snowboarding. But let there be no mistake, they are not necessarily noticeable to all, because they only relate to the carving practices of alpine and freeride snowboarding. Moreover, unlike the freebord and T-board, which have been specifically developed to emulate skateboard type of snowboarding, the carveboard was developed by a surfer/snowboarder for surfers/snowboarders. To put an end to sterile debates that inevitably arise around these competitive new boardsports offers, let's just remember that in essence emulating surfing or snowboarding on hard surface will always be imperfect.Top surfers and snowboarders use the carve board unique characteristics as a training tool when there are no waves or snow. We can thus assume that over <b>time,</b> <b>like</b> skateboarding, <b>these</b> sports will transcend their origins and establish themselves as separate sports and not more or less successful emulations.|$|R

40|$|Criteriology is {{the quest}} for {{permanent}} or stable criteria of rationality founded in the desire for objectivism {{and the belief that}} we must somehow transcend the limitations to knowing that are the inevitable consequence of our sociotemporal perspective as knowers. The project of criteriology has, in turn, shaped our way of thinking about the epistemol-ogy of social inquiry. This article offers a way of redefining social inquiry without recourse to criteriology. It presents a view of social inquiry as practical philosophy and discusses the vision that enables that practice, the conditions that sustain that practice, and the place of such a practice in society.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the perception and preferences of local communities is a fundamental aspect to increase the social sustainability and to reduce the conflicts between forest users. The knowledge of people’s perception of forest resources is important for decision makers, when implementing management strategies and this is particularly relevant in mountainous area, characterized by a strong link between local communities and forest. The paper focuses on the {{analysis of}} people’s perception and preferences regarding the recreational value of forests. The research has been carried out {{by means of a}} case study, the Municipality of Trento, located in the Centre East sector of the Italian Alps. This area was chosen on the grounds of its geographical location and of the historical links that exist between local communities and forest resources. The sample included 1, 000 randomly selected families and the method of investigation used was a structured selfreported questionnaire. The data were processed taking into account the relationship between people’s perception and the main social characteristics of respondents (gender and age); this allowed statistical differences among groups to be highlighted. Forest attractiveness has been investigated considering: (i) forest accessibility, (ii) forest stand characteristics, (iii) visitor facilities and infrastructures. The results show that people prefer the open mixed forests with an irregular structure and some visitor facilities such as paths and refreshment points. Besides, people like to have facilities in the forests, but at the same <b>time</b> would <b>like</b> <b>these</b> forests to be little frequented by other visitors, {{in order to have a}} greater feeling of naturalness. </p...|$|R

60|$|It {{can now be}} hardly {{necessary}} to contradict these theories; or to show that none but a candidate for Bedlam as well as Tyburn could be seduced from the substantial comforts of existence, to seek destruction and disgrace, {{for the sake of}} such imaginary grandeur. The German nobleman of the fairest gifts and prospects turns out, on investigation, to have been a German blackguard, whom debauchery and riotous extravagance had reduced to want; who took to the highway, when he could take to nothing else,—not allured by an ebullient enthusiasm, or any heroical and misdirected appetite for sublime actions, but driven by the more palpable stimulus of importunate duns, an empty purse, and five craving senses. Perhaps in his later days, this philosopher may have referred to Schiller's tragedy, as the source from which he drew his theory of life: but if so, we believe he was mistaken. For characters like him, the great attraction was the charms of revelry, and the great restraint, the gallows,—before the period of Karl von Moor, just as they have been since, and will be to the end of <b>time.</b> Among motives <b>like</b> <b>these,</b> the influence of even the most malignant book could scarcely be discernible, and would be little detrimental, if it were.|$|R

40|$|Sonars {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of marine applications. The {{advantage}} of using sound waves in water has made the sonar technique ideal to detect underwater objects, imaging of the seafloor and detection of vessels. Sound waves can propagate over long distances in water unlike other waves. The ability to see underwater using acoustic waves has made the sonar technique important for marine and military industry. Most sonars uses the far-field when imaging. To characterize a sonars ability to depict one can measure the sonars far-field characteristics. This is usually done in big water tanks because the far-field boundary often is several meters away. This thesis investigates the possibility of characterizing the sonar using near-field measurements. This is done with simulations in matlab and measurements on a Simrad SH- 90 transducer in a [] water tank at the University in Oslo. This was the first <b>time</b> measurements <b>like</b> <b>these</b> were done in the water tank so development of hardware and procedures were necessary. A method of simulating the wave field with parameters as close to the conditions in the water tank as possible was developed. The result of simulations showed that the system was sensitive to changes in the sound velocity. We found that it was possible to characterize a transducer if we had a calibrated system were the only unknown parameter is the speed of sound. By using the least square method of errors it was possible to characterize a transducer by finding the elements weights and phase. This gave us a basis for trying to match up the data in the measurement experiment. When trying to match up the simulated and measured data we found that there were too many unknowns in the measuring experiment. Due to time limitations of this thesis we were not able to do an optimal calibration of the measuring system. The work on this thesis showed us that it was possible to characterize a transducer in the simulations but more work has to be done on the measuring system...|$|R
