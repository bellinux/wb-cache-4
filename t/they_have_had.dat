5|$|The {{committee}} then {{analyzes the}} nominees {{based on the}} following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage. Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded {{to the board of}} directors, who then select the inductees.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the company}} {{has proven to be}} very profitable, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> much less success at {{producing}} winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their 1967 Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|By 1675 George's eldest {{uncle had}} died without issue, but his {{remaining}} two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass {{to their own}} sons, should <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E
5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm. The main complaint raised {{was related to the}} delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage. In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency Preparedness and Response Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor to be the worst disaster <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to deal with. Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E

She starts a romantic relationship with Hooper, who is the younger brother of a man she used to date, and the two have a brief affair in a motel outside of town. Throughout {{the rest of the}} novel, Brody suspects <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a liaison and is haunted by the thought.|$|E

5|$|Molecular clock {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62mya. Between 47 and 54mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified {{and filled the}} niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to compete with monkeys and apes, {{as well as other}} mammals.|$|E
5|$|Non-Americans {{collected}} 11 {{victories in}} 20 {{years in the}} 1980s and 1990s, by far the strongest run <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{in any of the}} three majors played in the United States {{since the early days of}} the U.S. Open. The first European to win the Masters was Seve Ballesteros in 1980. Nicklaus became the oldest player to win the Masters in 1986 when he won for the sixth time at age 46.|$|E
5|$|The Walk of Fame {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1996 when Peter Soumalias suggested {{the idea of}} a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians. Canada's Walk of Fame runs an annual contest in which Canadians can nominate potential inductees. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail. The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage. Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.|$|E

5|$|Volcanoes {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be active if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> eruptions during the Holocene. However, {{as demonstrated by the}} unexpected eruption of Chaiten volcano in Chile in May 2008, even long-inactive volcanoes can become active again. Such volcanoes can constitute a threat to regions with seemingly quiet volcanism. Ciomadul has had repose periods of over 10,000 years and possibly even longer. Zircon crystallization data imply that the magma chambers of Ciomadul were active over time spans of over 300,000 years.|$|E
5|$|With {{their loss}} to Auburn, Alabama {{completed}} the first winless season in Alabama football history, {{and since then}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> only two other winless seasons in 1895 and 1955. The losses of 1893 were attributed to the small stature of the Crimson players {{and not to the}} coaching and training of the team. As such, Abbott returned as head coach for the 1894 season and led Alabama to a winning season that included their first all-time win over Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Albion {{were one}} of the {{founding}} members of the Football League in 1888 and have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football. They have been champions of England once, in 1919–20, and have been runners-up twice but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> more success in the FA Cup, winning it five times. The first came in 1888, the year the league was founded, and the most recent in 1968, their last major trophy. They also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966. The club's longest consecutive period in the top division spanned twenty-four years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever spell out of the top division. They currently play in the Premier League.|$|E

60|$|The six Rovers <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a {{long and}} uneventful train ride from Haven Point to the Grand Central Terminal, Forty-second Street, New York City. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> to change cars at the Junction, where some months before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> such fun with Mr. Asa Lemm, the {{discharged}} teacher of the Hall, as related in detail in the volume previous to this. The train <b>had</b> been crowded with passengers, but the Rovers <b>had</b> managed to get seats together, much to their satisfaction; and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> also managed to get pretty fair accommodations {{when it came time}} to go into the diner.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in {{addition to}} having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E

5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
5|$|The Astros {{have made}} 12 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. They have made the first overall selection in the draft five times; in 1976, 1992, 2012, 2013, and 2014. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> 16 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Astros have failed to sign three of their first-round picks. First, pitcher Randy Scarbery (1970) did not sign though the Astros received no pick in compensation. John Burke (1991) and Brady Aiken (2014) also did not sign. The Astros were given the 37th pick of the 1992 draft and a pick in the 2015 draft in compensation.|$|E
