Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to be combined with the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E

40|$|Bulk {{segregant}} analysis (BSA) {{coupled to}} high throughput sequencing {{is a powerful}} method to map genomic regions related with phenotypes of interest.

Genomic regions linked to the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> interest are identified by searching the pool for overrepresented alleles that normally originate from the superior parent.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the dynamic of a structured branching population where the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> each individual moves according to a Markov process. The rate of division of each individual is a function <b>of</b> its <b>trait</b> and when a branching event occurs, the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> a descendant at birth depends on the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> the mother. We prove a law of large numbers for the empirical distribution of ancestral trajectories. It ensures that the empirical measure converges to the mean value of the spine which is a time-inhomogeneous Markov process describing the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> a typical individual along its ancestral lineage. Our approach relies on ergodicity arguments for this time-inhomogeneous Markov process. We apply this technique on the example of a size-structured population with exponential growth in varying environment...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, the Netherlands {{introduced}} Genomically Enhanced Breeding Values (GEBV) {{in their}} national evaluation. These GEBV {{were based on}} a post-processing step. For further optimization, a very basic method is proposed to incorporate the DGV based on genomic data directly into the conventional breeding value estimation: mass-selection. The DGV are transformed to pseudo-observations which are analyzed as correlated trait (to the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> interest) with a mass-selection model. The correlation between the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> interest and this pseudo-trait is 1, and the heritability of the pseudo-trait is set to the predictive value of the DGV (estimated from cross-validation). In this way the pseudo-trait EBVaffects the EBV <b>of</b> the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> interest of genotyped individuals, which in turn affects the EBV of relatives, effectively dropping the genomic information down the pedigrees <b>of</b> the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> interest.

5|$|Gottesman first {{studied the}} {{genetics}} of schizophrenia {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E
5|$|Harald {{was born}} in Ringerike, Norway in 1015 (or {{possibly}} 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald {{was the youngest of}} King Olaf Haraldsson's (later Saint Olaf) three half-brothers. In his youth, Harald displayed <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model.

Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E

J.R.R.Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan.
