5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> {{seized power}} on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was swiftly scrapped; a ruling on 12 March {{established}} two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and {{the flag of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute {{regarding}} his membership in <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b> He had maintained that the Venice Agreement meant that he {{and other members of the}} Styrian Home Guard had been accepted into <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> with prestigious low membership numbers corresponding to the dates of their entry into the Home Guard. However, the treasurer of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party,</b> Franz Xaver Schwarz did not accept the Agreement and determined that the members of the Styrian Home Guard were not automatically transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b> This became an issue when Hitler decided to mark the 10th anniversary of his seizure of power and tasked his private secretary and head of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, to determine who should be issued one of a strictly limited number of Golden Party Badges to mark the anniversary. Meyszner, who had been recommended by Himmler, accepted that his party membership was retrospectively determined to be 1 June 1938 and he was allocated a party number of 6,119,650. Thus he effectively joined <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> as late as 1943. Due to these decisions, Meyszner did not qualify as an Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter) and Himmler had to intervene on behalf of Meyszner to ensure he received the badge. Meyszner was one of only five SS men that Himmler deemed worthy of this particular award.|$|E

5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party,</b> which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was {{the main reason for}} losing the war. Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power. <b>The</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>party</b> took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions. <b>The</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>party</b> used posters, films, books and public speakers among other tactics.|$|E

5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds. <b>The</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as irrelevant, persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage.

50|$|Although Stauffenberg {{agreed with}} some of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party's</b> nationalistic aspects and had {{supported}} the German colonization of Poland and made racist remarks regarding Polish Jews, he found many aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party's</b> ideology repugnant and never became a member. Moreover, Stauffenberg remained a practicing Catholic. Stauffenberg vacillated between a strong personal dislike of Hitler's policies and a respect for what he perceived to be Hitler's military acumen. On top of this, the growing systematic ill-treatment of Jews and suppression of religion had offended Stauffenberg's strong personal sense of Catholic morality and justice.|$|R
