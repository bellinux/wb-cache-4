Unfortunately this is often not the case and virtually all aerial photographs experience tilt up to 3°.

50|$|Stabilization qualities {{enhanced}} by placement of Kenyon gyros onto mount Helicopter mounts {{are based on}} the principle of a balanced beam that has its gimbal point (center of gravity) behind the operator’s head. The gimbal point is the exact balance point of the roll, pitch and yaw. At the front of the balanced beam is the camera and camera control. At the back of the beam are the counterweights and batteries. The camera has an additional pan and <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> (yaw and pitch axis). These are balanced in their own right about the sub camera <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> of the balanced beam. This balanced beam in itself has a certain amount of inertia and will resist minimal angular disturbances coming up the gimbal mounting frame. However, in order to achieve a further degree of stabilization, Kenyon gyro modules are added. The Kenyon gyro module is an off-the-shelf motorized flywheel in a cage with one degree of freedom. When the spinning masses (flywheels) within the Kenyon gyro housing, are activated, they add an increased inertia (synthetic) to the overall system, which improves the mount’s ability to absorb the base angular disturbances from reaching the camera. These helicopter mounts with or without Kenyon gyros, can work quite well if: the weather conditions are perfect; the helicopter has the minimum of low frequency vibration (blades have been ‘tracked’ correctly); and you have a “qualified movie pilot” in control of the ship. An operator can achieve good stability for medium focal length lenses with short duration shots at the longer end of the lens. The drawbacks of (C) systems are that the operator’s physical strength is needed to position the camera while they are hanging out the side door of the helicopter. It is hard for the operator to maneuver the camera’s line of site when they are following a subject. The Kenyon gyros will resist their camera positioning, as the gyro will consider it part of the angular base motion. Because of this interaction, the helicopter pilot must undertake most of the camera positioning; the operator will just point the camera at the subject, relying on the pilot for keeping the subject in frame.|$|E
5000|$|His most {{important}} {{contributions in the}} 1960s to 1980s were based on his experience with X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, from which he derived pioneering theories, including the invention of [...] "ptychography". These led to experimental studies of the practicability of performing high resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of complex biological macromolecules which at that time {{were not able to}} be assembled into the crystalline arrays necessary for structural determination by X-ray diffraction (e.g. ribosomes). Hoppe's ideas of combining many images of the same specimen (a negatively stained electron microscope preparation containing the object of interest) recorded over a wide range of tilt angles (not necessarily restricted to a simple <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> perpendicular to the electron beam), followed by reconstruction of the three-dimensional object via mathematical manipulations involving Fourier space transforms or weighted filtered back projections, constitute the basis of many extant 3D reconstruction techniques, including computer tomography in medicine and internal investigation of materials. He was acutely aware of electron damage causing alteration of the specimen's structure during observation and his studies contributed significantly to the development of minimal dose methodology. Much of his early contribution to the field has been overlooked by other workers since it was published mainly in German language journals. A biographical note appeared in J. Appl. Cryst.

The measured energy spectrum and transition probabilities for the Nd- 135 yrast band are reproduced well without any ad hoc renormalization factors when pairing effects are taken into account. A transition from collective to chiral rotation has been demonstrated. It is found that pairing correlations introduce additional admixtures in the single-particle orbitals, and, thus, influence the structure of <b>tilted</b> <b>axis</b> rotating nuclei by reducing the magnitude of the proton and neutron angular momenta while merging their direction.

30|$|The {{first step}} is to ensure that the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> is along the Z-plane of the volume. Since Trainable Weka Segmentation {{processes}} each slice individually, the classification will be more accurate if the software can “see” artefacts (e.g. missing wedge streaking) and meaningful data in the same image so that it can identify differences between the two. It will likewise be easier for the human operator to identify regions if both artefacts and when data are visible in the same plane. The software supplied with FEI microscopes, Inspect 3 D, produces reconstructions with the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> in the X-Y plane, so they need to be rotated before further use. Unless dual-tilt axis tomography or a sophisticated reconstruction algorithm which incorporates prior knowledge of the sample is used, the reconstruction procedure also operates on a “slice-by-slice” basis, where no image “slice” along the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> incorporates information from any other “slices”. Because of this, no information is lost when processing the final reconstruction in the same manner.|$|E

This procedure is adapted for specimens {{that can be}} fashioned into a needle-shaped sample and has been evaluated on inorganic samples. It consists of self-adapting denoising, automatic and accurate alignment including detection and correction of <b>tilt</b> <b>axis,</b> and 3 D reconstruction. We propose the exploitation of {{a large amount of}} information of an electron tomography acquisition to achieve robust and automatic mixed Poisson–Gaussian noise parameter estimation and denoising using undecimated wavelet transforms. The alignment is made by mixing three techniques, namely (i) cross-correlations between neighboring projections, (ii) common line algorithm to get a precise shift correction {{in the direction of the}} <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> and (iii) intermediate reconstructions to precisely determine the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> and shift correction in the direction perpendicular to that axis. Mixing alignment techniques turns out to be very efficient and fast. Significant improvements are highlighted in both simulations and real data reconstructions of porous silicon in high angle annular dark field mode and agglomerated silver nanoparticles in incoherent bright field mode. 3 D reconstructions obtained with minimal user-intervention present fewer artefacts and less noise, which permits easier and more reliable segmentation and quantitative analysis. After careful sample preparation and data acquisition, the denoising procedure, alignment and reconstruction can be achieved within an hour for a 3 D volume of about a hundred million voxels, which is a step toward a more routine use of electron tomograph...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of nano-scale cracks with grain boundaries in alpha-Fe were studied using symmetric tilt grain boundaries with [11 (2) over bar] and [(1) over bar 10] <b>tilt</b> <b>axis.</b> For each <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> {{four types of}} grain boundaries were chosen-low angle, general high angle, E 3 and Ell. A crack perpendicular to the boundary plane was introduced between the two boundaries. The grain boundaries were equilibrated using molecular statics simulation and the entire configuration was deformed at constant strain rate using isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble at 0 K. The stress strain behaviour of the configurations, variation of dislocation line density with strain and the screening effect of the grain boundaries were studied. The strain field around the crack tip and the dislocations emitted from it interact with the grain boundaries. The configuration with E 3 grain boundaries showed higher tensile strength while that with Ell showed lower tensile strength. This was attributed to {{the orientation of the}} dislocations in the { 1 (1) over bar 0 } boundary plane with 180 degrees tilt angle and the complete coherency with {(1) over bar(1) over bar 2 } boundary plane with 70. 53 degrees tilt angle. Further, in both the E 3 grain boundary configurations, even the most favourable slip system had a low Schmid factor, thus making slip difficult in the grain too.

This method selects, localizes and measures significant tilts from the comparison at various {{scales of the}} changes of orientation of sedimentary beddings. We tested this method on simple cases (unconformity, gradual tilt, successive tilts, without and with additional random noise) and on a field example, along three sections in the Eocene Sobrarbe delta, Ainsa foreland basin, northern Spain. For synthetic data sets, the method clearly identifies and measures the introduced tilts. On the field, sedimentary and tectonic structures, especially three main syn-sedimentary sliding surfaces (S 1 –S 3), were successfully identified from processed dipmeter data.
