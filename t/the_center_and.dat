5|$|A non-tropical frontal low {{developed}} from a cold front on November 1 {{to the west}} of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm on November 4 about 775 nautical miles (1435km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a ring around the center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds near <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> Noel weakened to a tropical storm early on November 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later on November 6 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.|$|E

5|$|On 23–24 November 1795, the Battle of Loano was fought. Schérer {{deployed}} Pierre Augereau with 6,961 {{troops on}} the right, Masséna with 13,276 men in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>and</b> Sérurier with 5,155 soldiers on the left. The plan called for Sérurier to pin down the Allied right while Masséna broke through <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>and</b> rolled up the Allied left {{with the help of}} Augereau. By luck, Wallis replaced De Vins in command of the Allies on 22 November. That day Sérurier's attack on the Colle San Bernardo was repulsed but it tied down Colli's division. The plan was carried out with success. Masséna and Augereau both defeated the forces in front of them. The Austro-Sardinians suffered losses of 3,000 killed and wounded, 4,000 prisoners, 48 guns and five colors while French losses numbered 2,500 killed and wounded and 500 captured. Snow soon compelled both armies to withdraw into winter quarters. The French soldiers were in a wretched state, with very little food; they became insubordinate and the generals quarreled. Sérurier got into a dispute with Schérer and nearly left the army. On 18 March 1796 Sérurier's division refused to obey orders.|$|E

5|$|A broad mid-tropospheric trough {{over the}} southeastern United States spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} over the lower Mississippi River Valley on July 13, and drifted southward towards the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a weak and isolated surface low pressure area formed {{off the coast of}} Louisiana. The circulation in the system steadily expanded, and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent. On July 16, deep convection increased and organized near <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> oil rigs and surface buoys reported surface winds of 30mph (50km/h). Based on the observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 while about 150miles (240km) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough {{brought it to}} the northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, developed into a subtropical depression on June1. Operationally, it was treated as a frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled and began {{weakening}} {{to the southeast}} of Bermuda on September15, spawning a low-pressure area by September18. A stationary wind circulation developed around the low by September19, aided by a trough aloft to its west. Convection developed into narrow banding features far from <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> the overall structure gradually consolidated. It is estimated that the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September20, about 490miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical {{because of the large}} distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on September21, and as such was named Kyle by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>and</b> radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>and</b> became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone.

However, convection increased over <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E
