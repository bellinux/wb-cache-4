40|$|Graphene {{is a very}} {{attractive}} material for broadband photodetection in hyperspectral imaging and sensing systems. However, its potential use has been hindered by tradeoffs between the responsivity, bandwidth, and operation speed of existing graphene photodetectors. Here, we present engineered photoconductive nanostructures based on gold-patched graphene nanoribbons, which enable simultaneous broadband and ultrafast photodetection with high responsivity. These nanostructures merge the advantages of broadband optical absorption, ultrafast photocarrier transport, and carrier multiplication in graphene nanoribbons with the ultrafast transport of photocarriers to the gold patches before recombination. Through this approach, high-responsivity operation is achieved {{without the use of}} bandwidth- and speed-limiting quantum dots, defect states, or <b>tunneling</b> <b>barriers.</b> We demonstrate high-responsivity photodetection from the visible to the infrared regime (0. 6 A/W at 0. 8 μm and 11. 5 A/W at 20 μm) with operation speeds exceeding 50 GHz. Our results demonstrate an improvement of the response times by more than seven orders of magnitude and an increase in bandwidths of one order of magnitude compared to those of higher-responsivity graphene photodetectors based on quantum dots and <b>tunneling</b> <b>barriers.</b> Comment: 33 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the group delay in {{tunneling}} is not a traversal time but a lifetime of stored energy or stored probability escaping through {{both ends of the}} barrier. Because it is a lifetime associated with both forward (transmitted) and backward (reflected) fluxes, it cannot be used to define a group velocity for forward transit in cases where a wavepacket is mostly reflected. For photonic <b>tunneling</b> <b>barriers</b> the group delay is identical to the dwell time which is also a property of an entire wave function with reflected and transmitted components.

5000|$|In some respects, field {{electron}} emission is a paradigm {{example of what}} physicists mean by tunneling. Unfortunately, {{it is also a}} paradigm example of the intense mathematical difficulties that can arise. Simple solvable models of the <b>tunneling</b> <b>barrier</b> lead to equations (including the original 1928 Fowler-Nordheim-type equation) that get predictions of emission current density too low by a factor of 100 or more. If one inserts a more realistic barrier model into the simplest form of the Schrödinger equation, then an awkward mathematical problem arises over the resulting differential equation: it is known to be mathematically impossible in principle to solve this equation exactly in terms of the usual functions of mathematical physics, or in any simple way. To get even an approximate solution, it is necessary to use special approximate methods known in physics as [...] "semi-classical" [...] or [...] "quasi-classical" [...] methods. Worse, a mathematical error was made in the original application of these methods to field emission, and even the corrected theory that was put in place in the 1950s has been formally incomplete until very recently. A consequence of these (and other) difficulties has been a heritage of misunderstanding and disinformation that still persists in some current field emission research literature.
