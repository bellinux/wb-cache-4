40|$|The {{spectral}} {{origin of}} the recently discovered multidecadal modes (MMs) and centennial modes (CMs) is explained. These modes appear in the linear stability analysis of thermohaline-driven flows in a singlehemispheric ocean basin. It is shown that both classes of modes arise through interaction of so-called sea surface temperature (SST) modes. These SST modes are damped and nonoscillatory for the unforced (motionless) flow. They become oscillatory under small thermal forcing through mode merging that is induced by the meridional overturning circulation.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the effects of}} corporate mergers on organizational slack. It is hypothesized that organizational slack will be reduced in the acquiring firms following the merger. Further, it is hypothesized that the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> will affect the resultant change in slack. A multidimensional financial model is used to measure change in slack between pre- and post-merger time frames for 50 mergers that occurred in 1977 and 1978. Similar measures are calculated for a control group of 43 nonmerging firms. It is found that the merged firms undergo significantly greater reductions in slack than their nonmerging counterparts. Among the merged firms, horizontal mergers show the largest decrease in slack, followed by vertical mergers, and finally conglomerates. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} macroeconomic and industry-level factors (with {{particular emphasis on}} the business cycle) on industry-level merger activity.

Although macroeconomic variables have similar effects on both horizontal and non-horizontal mergers, industry-level factors vary significantly between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mergers.</b> Horizontal mergers are much more aligned with neo-classical theories, while non-horizontal mergers are more affected by financing constraints and overvaluation.

40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. Cooperative mergers are both theoretically possible and empirically observable in labour-managed economies. This paper discusses system-specific differences between mergers in a capitalist {{and in a}} labour-managed economy. Beside the systemic attraction of conglomerate mergers in labour managed economies {{for the sake of}} risk-reduction through diversification, two system-specific types of mergers are considered: i) between capital-hungry and product-hungry cooperatives and ii) between cooperatives at least one of which experiences labour-surplus. The typical short-term inefficiency of labour deployment in labour-managed economies is shown to be reduced by the existence of the first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> and the apparent absence of the second type. In particular, the non-fulfilment of conditions for labour-redeployment mergers is used to attribute income inequality in Yugoslavia also to factors other than labour allocation disequilibrium...|$|E

In this paper we study the implications for merger policy when countries non-cooperatively deploy production-based taxes. We find that whether national or international mergers {{are more likely to}} be en- acted in the presence of nationally optimal tax policies depends crucially on the ownership structure of firms. When all firms are owned domestically in the pre- merger situation, non-cooperative tax policies are more efficient in the national merger case and smaller synergy effects are needed for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>merger</b> to be proposed and cleared.

40|$|Purpose of the study: The aim of {{this study}} is to gain an {{understanding}} of the merger experiences academic staff were exposed to during the pre-merger phase of the University of Johannesburg merger. Of particular interest is how these experiences translate into acceptance of the merger amongst academic staff. The study was borne out of the transformation of the higher education landscape in South Africa, which is typified by a spate of mergers between higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: As the purpose of the study was, inter alia, aimed at understanding the merger experiences of academic staff, the study was conducted according to an interpretive research paradigm, where interpretation of data calls for an insider perspective, in order to "see things through their eyes" as it were. In this regard, a qualitative methodology was employed. Findings: Findings indicate that academic staff members at the University of Johannesburg experience two distinct mental states during the pre-merger phase. Following the announcement of the merger, reaction and experience tend to be emotionally driven but as merging efforts become more concrete over time, this emotive state is replaced by a more rationally driven disposition. Implications: The distinction between an emotive and rational demeanour during the pre-merger phase of a merger affords managers and leaders the opportunity to plan change interventions in such a way that irrational, emotive responses and behaviour do not hamper progress in terms of merger implementation. In a more general sense, this study highlights the process of transition individual staff members pass through as they have to come to terms with the changes brought about by a merger. Originality / Value: The majority of merger literature, as well as change literature, focuses on the organisational context of change during a merger. Limited literature exists on the personal effects of a change event such as a merger. This study can thus contribute to the understanding of the personal effects of change during a merger. Furthermore, scant literature exists concerning mergers that are not driven by "conventional" economic motives. As the University of Johannesburg is this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>merger,</b> this study presents the opportunity of gaining a better understanding of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>merger.</b> </p...|$|E
