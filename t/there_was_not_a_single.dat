Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> U-boat {{in the vicinity of}} Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia.

From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is the healer {{and that there is}} no efficacy in a drug.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> person who was not either related to or acquainted with {{a person who had}} died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E

25|$|When Jacob Berab died, Karo was {{regarded}} as his successor, and together with Rabbi Moshe of Trani he headed the Rabbinical Court of Safed. In fact, by this time, the Rabbinical Court of Safed had become the central rabbinical court in all of Old Yishuv (southern Ottoman Syria), and indeed of the diaspora as well. Thus <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> matter of national or global importance that {{did not come to}} the attention and ruling of the Safed Beth Din. Its rulings were accepted as final and conclusive, and Karo's halachic decisions and clarifications were sought by sages from every corner of the diaspora. Rabbi Joseph Karo was also visited in Safed by the great Egyptian scholars of his day, Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra and Rabbi Yaakov Castro. He came to be regarded {{as the leader of the}} entire generation.|$|E
25|$|When the Diocese of Newark was {{established}} {{he was named}} its first bishop and consecrated 30 October 1853, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, by Archbishop Gaetano Bedini, the Apostolic Nuncio to Brazil, who was then en route to Rome. The Bishops of Brooklyn and Burlington—whose dioceses were likewise erected in 1853—were consecrated at the same time, the first occurrence of such an elaborate ceremony in the United States. Bishop Bayley's work of organizing the new diocese was not easy. He had more than 40,000 Catholics, mainly of Irish and German extraction, with only twenty-five priests to minister to them. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> diocesan institution, no funds, and poverty on all sides. He therefore applied for help to the Association of the Propagation of the Faith of Lyons, France, and to the Leopoldine Association of Vienna and from both received material assistance.|$|E

All the analysis is so elegant that Sir William Rowan Hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning {{to the end of the}} work <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> diagram.

25|$|Official Soviet figures {{reported}} {{that up to}} one third of urban and two thirds of rural population still held religious beliefs by 1937 (a decrease from estimated 80% of the country being religious in the late 1920s); altogether this made up 50% of the state's population (and even these figures may have been low estimates). However, religion had been hit very powerfully; the number of churches had been reduced from 50,000 in 1917 to {{only a few hundred}} (and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> church open in Belarus) or perhaps even less, out of 300 bishops in 1917 (and 163 in 1929) only 4 remained (Metropolitan Sergii (the head of the church), Metropolitan Alexii of Leningrad, Bishop Nikolai (Yarushevich), and Metropolitan Sergi (Voskresenski)), out of 45,000 priests there were only to 2,000–3,000 remaining, not a single monastery remained open {{and the only thing that}} enthusiasts of atheism could still do was to spy on individual believers and denounce them to the secret police.|$|E
25|$|The Allies {{resolved}} upon an expedition, led by Rooke, {{to capture}} the southern Spanish port of Cádiz, and at a stroke cut off Spain's transatlantic trade. However, on arrival in August 1702 the Allies made little or no progress in the assault on Cádiz. Fort Matagorda held out, and after several days Rooke declared {{that even if the}} fort was taken, another stronghold guarding the entrance to the Puntales (a sandy spit near the entrance to the inner harbour) would prevent the fleet from navigating the narrow passage: and so the mission was abandoned. However the English Government had become aware that a Spanish treasure fleet was sitting in Vigo Bay and instructed Rooke to intercept it in October 1702. The third-rate HMS Torbay, commanded by Thomas Hopsonn, led the assault on the boom across the bay and, once it was breached, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> French or Spanish vessel that had not been either captured or destroyed at the Battle of Vigo Bay. Rooke received the thanks of Parliament in this important action in the opening stages of the War of the Spanish Succession.|$|E
25|$|James King, {{a popular}} {{journalist}} and publisher, vehemently protested the administrative graft of Broderick which angered one of Broderick's biggest supporters, a supervisor named James Casey. While King {{was standing in}} front of his newspaper's building Casey shot King in the chest, causing a mortal wound which would ultimately launch the formation of a second Vigilance Committee in May 1856. Within two hours after Casey's shooting of King, a mob of 10,000 people surrounded the jail where Casey was being held. The vigilantes then demanded that the jail release James Casey into their custody, and the badly out-numbered jail guards acquiesced to their demands. King died six days after being shot, and subsequently Casey was put on trial by the Vigilance Committee. King's funeral attracted over 15,000 people, but by the time the funeral had ended Casey had already been convicted and hanged by the vigilantes. Now energized by wide public support, the Vigilance Committee set up shop in a large building near the wharf which included jail cells, court rooms, a surrounding wall to resist any military intervention, and was nicknamed Fort Gunnybags. During the two months that followed the hanging of Casey <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> murder in San Francisco, and less than a half dozen robberies. In August 1856 the vigilance committee decided to disband and give control back to the elected officials.|$|E

500|$|Richard H. Kline {{served as}} the film's cinematographer. Working from sketch artist Maurice Zuberano's concepts, Wise would judge {{if they were on}} the right track. Kline and Michelson would then discuss the look they wanted (along with Weldon, if effects were involved.) Each {{sequence}} was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute. The cinematographer called his function to [...] "interpret [...] preplanning and make it indelible on film. It's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength." [...] Kline would recall that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> [...] "easy" [...] shot to produce for the picture, as each scene required special consideration. The bridge, for example, was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better.

500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association.

This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness." [...] Starr added: [...] "He took little pills to make him ill." [...] Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18 million he had sought.|$|E
500|$|Fighting between Aborigines and Europeans was {{localised}} as the Aborigines did {{not form}} confederations capable of sustained resistance. As a result, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> war, {{but rather a}} series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic [...] "myth" [...] of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting {{in a number of}} indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so-called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832, and aimed at driving most of the island's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population.|$|E
