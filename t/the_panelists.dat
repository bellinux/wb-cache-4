5|$|In 1966, McGown {{staged a}} billiards {{exhibition}} at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he brought along the 6-year-old Balukas, where she {{participated in the}} spectacle. The attention this generated, coupled with her prodigious talent, landed her a guest appearance in 1966 on WNEW-TV's Wonderama. Later that year, Balukas, along with her younger sister Laura, appeared on CBS's popular show I've Got a Secret. None of <b>the</b> <b>panelists</b> were successful in guessing that the 7- and 5-year-old sisters were pool enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{list was}} made through unranked voting {{completed}} by fifty selected panelists. Sixteen of <b>the</b> <b>panelists</b> were former players voting in {{their roles as}} players, thirteen {{were members of the}} print and broadcast news media, and twenty-one were team representatives: contemporary and former general managers, head coaches, and executives. Of the last group, thirteen were former NBA players. Players were prohibited from voting for themselves.

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> catches <b>the</b> {{contestant}} due to {{too many}} incorrect responses, the game ends and <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> receives $1,400 (later a trip). <b>The</b> <b>panelist</b> returns as <b>the</b> next game's challenger, regardless of the outcome and players remained as contestants, until eliminated or until the bonus round is won.|$|R
50|$|After {{making his}} or her choice, the contestant's booth was turned off and <b>the</b> {{corresponding}} <b>panelist</b> attempted to complete his/her bid. Once <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> successfully completed his/her bid, the contestant's booth was turned back on. The contestant must then give as many correct answers as <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> gave. If <b>the</b> contestant successfully matched <b>the</b> <b>panelist,</b> he or she won {{the game and the}} champion's winnings were multiplied accordingly. The contestant also earned the right to return on the next show to decide whether to play another game or walk away with his/her winnings; if at any point a contestant failed to match <b>the</b> <b>panelist's</b> bid, <b>the</b> contestant lost the game and departed with 10% of all previous winnings.|$|R
50|$|The winning {{contestant}} and panelist {{play on a}} giant daisy structure {{consisting of}} eight petals, numbered clockwise from 1-8. The contestant starts at petal #1 and <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> starts on petal #6. The host asks the contestant a series of true/false questions and the contestant advances one petal for each correct answer, while <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> advances one petal for an incorrect answer. The contestant must catch <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> in 50 seconds (later 45, then 40 on the US version) or less. If the contestant succeeds, that contestant wins a new car (and $700 in early episodes). If the timer runs out, <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> wins $100 of the contestant's $700 for each petal that separated them in whichever direction is the greater distance; later in the series, the contestant did not receive money for failing to capture <b>the</b> <b>panelist.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unlike its predecessor, the {{syndicated}} What's My Line? did not emphasize formality as <b>the</b> <b>panelists</b> dressed in normal attire. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>panelists</b> were simply {{referred to by}} name and only their first names were displayed in front of them. The show did manage to keep some elements of the original series intact, as the intro used during the final two seasons on CBS was reused. <b>The</b> <b>panelists</b> also entered {{in the same manner}} as they had before with Soupy Sales (or the panelist occupying the seat furthest left when he was absent) coming out first and introducing the person sitting next to him, and continuing down the line to Arlene Francis (or whoever occupied her seat while she was absent), who would then introduce the host.|$|E

The contestant is required to correctly judge {{the truth of the}} statement in order to capture the panelist; otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> receives <b>the</b> $100. The challenger then undertakes the same process with one of <b>the</b> remaining <b>panelists,</b> while <b>the</b> champion tries to capture <b>the</b> remaining <b>panelist.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bonus round is {{the same}} as before, except that <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> helps <b>the</b> {{contestant}}. If the contestant catches <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> in 50 seconds or less, the two players split $1,000 for each correct answer given and team up to answer a bonus question for the chance to win a car each.|$|R

50|$|Answer cards list {{a secret}} slime action and a {{corresponding}} consequence. During {{the rounds of}} play the contestant watches for the panel to perform the secret slime action. If someone does perform this action, the contestant announces Slime Action, the timer is stopped, and the slime action consequence is revealed to <b>the</b> <b>panelist</b> being penalized. This consequence must then be performed by <b>the</b> <b>panelist.</b> <b>The</b> timer is then restarted and play resumes as normal.|$|R
25|$|However, {{even with}} such formality, Daly was not above trading bon mots with <b>the</b> <b>panelists</b> during the game, and Cerf would often {{attempt to make}} a pun of his name. Occasionally Daly would amiably one-up Cerf if he felt the pun was of lesser quality. Cerf also played a myriad of games with Daly's full name, John Charles Patrick Croghan Daly, reciting it {{correctly}} {{only a handful of}} times {{over the course of the}} series.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the game was for famous celebrities of the past to {{correctly}} answer questions that pertained to a scene of a movie.

They were battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs, and fire chiefs from departments of similar sizes to New Haven's throughout the country. Sixty-six percent of <b>the</b> <b>panelists</b> were minorities, {{and each of the}} nine three-member assessment panels contained two minority members. They received training on how to score the candidates' responses consistently using checklists of desired criteria.|$|E
25|$|Reilly {{was late}} for the taping of two episodes; Goodson filled in for {{him for the first}} few minutes of one, and {{announcer}} Johnny Olson did the same on the other. Celebrity panelists appeared in week-long blocks, due to the show's production schedule. A number of celebrities, including Betty White, Dick Martin, Marcia Wallace, Bill Daily, Fannie Flagg, and Patti Deutsch were semi-regular panelists, usually appearing several times a year. Celebrity panelists also included personalities from other Goodson-Todman produced game shows, such as The Price Is Rights Bob Barker and Janice Pennington. <b>The</b> <b>panelists</b> were all seated in a strict order; the male guest panelist of the week, Somers, and Reilly sat in the top row from the viewer's left to right, and the female guest panelist of the week, Dawson (later a semi-regular panelist), and a semi-regular female panelist occupied the bottom row.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences {{was looking}} into {{research}} about the controversial issues regarding acid rain. President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge {{attention on the}} issues of acid rain until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US. Reagan honored the agreement to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s enforcement of anti-pollution regulation. In 1982, US President Ronald Reagan commissioned William Nierenberg to sit on National Science Board. Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to sit on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reviewed the draft report and sent Fred Singer’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain. <b>The</b> <b>panelists</b> revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nirenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was {{due to the fact that}} the report was not ready to be published.|$|E
