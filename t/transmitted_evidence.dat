40|$|Civil {{laws and}} civil justice in early China have not {{received}} sufficient scholarly attention, because scholars tend to assume that laws in pre-modern China were merely criminal laws promulgated and enforced to maintain public order. This dissertation challenges that view by analyzing excavated evidence and reexamining <b>transmitted</b> <b>evidence.</b> Chapter One establishes the existence of civil laws in early China by examining non-criminal case reports preserved in the Juyan strips and by assessing the role of district bailiffs in handling civil disputes. Chapter Two further demonstrates the existence of civil laws and reveals the civil justice system by studying domestic statutes and how two cases of inheritance disputes preserved in the Comprehensive Discussion of Customs (Fengsu tongyi, comp. ca. 200) illustrate {{the application of the}}se statutes. Chapter Three examines two important civil legal concepts: zhi (a straight account of the facts) and mingfen (title and portion) to reveal the underlining notions that uniformly guided the application of the civil laws. Chapter Four, the concluding chapter, goes beyond the boundaries of civil laws to address larger issues, such as the legal ideal of reforming people's morals to reduce lawsuits, the relationship between rituals and laws, and the Classics as a source of legal authority in litigations. Overall, I conclude that civil laws and civil justice existed in early China; and that this distinctive body of civil laws, while not systematically codified, were substantial, sophisticated, and empire-wide in application and authority...|$|E

The aim of the project is a technical realization of a trusted business platform for acquisition and processing of signed evidence data, which are collected in a mobile environment. This master thesis discusses the design and development of a rules-based processing of events that are published by different components and devices (e. g. evidence generator) over the MAP server, which are {{based on the}} TNC-architecture. For the implementation of a rule-based processing a policy client is developed, which subscribes the evidence data from different devices such as the evidence generator and verifies the signed data packages with predefined rules. The principle for the rule-based processing of the evidence data, the policy client uses the language XACML for the implementation, with policies and rules can be defined and evaluated by access requests. Through the verification of the evidence data according to different rules various errors, attacks like a replay attack or tampering can be discovered at an early stage in the processing chain and appropriate countermeasures can be started. For the verification of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>evidence</b> data the information from the metadata are used in combination with the defined rules to generate the corresponding requests that are evaluated by the policy decision point.

First, two studies using data from large social media platforms (Twitter and LiveJournal) show that content posted by higher-activity transmitters—whom we refer to as “social pumps”—propagates more than content posted by lower-activity transmitters. Second, three experiments explore the mechanism driving this effect, showing that social media users receiving content from a social pump are more likely to retransmit it (a necessary behavior for achieving aggregate-level propagation) because they infer that content from a social pump {{is more likely to be}} current, and therefore more attractive as something to pass along through retransmission...|$|R

The reason for this high estimation is the combination of the early date assigned to the manuscript on the basis of paleography (ca. 175 - 225 CE) and its close agreement with the text of Codex Vaticanus, which is thought to provide evidence that the "B text" of Vaticanus was produced as early as the second century and was very carefully <b>transmitted.</b> The <b>evidence</b> gathered in the present essay calls these conclusions into question by showing that both paleographically and codicologically, P.

40|$|BACKGROUND: PARV 4 {{is a human}} {{parvovirus}} that was first detected in and cloned from an individual with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion-like illness and that subsequently persisted in the lymphoid tissue and bone marrow. In contrast to {{human parvovirus}} B 19 infections, PARV 4 infections are most frequently detected in injection drug users (IDUs), particularly those who are coinfected with HIV type 1 (HIV- 1). To investigate the routes of transmission of PARV 4 and to ascertain whether infections are acquired through plasma-derived blood products, we developed a novel anti-PARV 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine its seroprevalence in subjects with parenteral exposure. METHODS: PARV 4 viral protein 2 (VP 2) was expressed and used as antigen in an indirect ELISA, to detect anti-PARV 4 immunoglobulin G. RESULTS: All 50 adult control subjects who were nonparenterally exposed to PARV 4 were anti-PARV 4 negative, in contrast to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected IDUs, who had antibody frequencies of 67 % and 33 %, respectively. Predominantly parenteral transmission was confirmed by the finding of similar frequencies of infection among HIV-coinfected and HIV-uninfected hemophiliacs (11 of 20 individuals and 4 of 15 individuals, respectively) who were treated with nonvirally inactivated factor VIII/factor IX, whereas all but 1 of the 35 nonhemophiliac siblings of these siblings {{were found to be}} seronegative (despite having close household contact). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides convincing evidence that PARV 4 is primarily <b>transmitted</b> parenterally. <b>Evidence</b> for widespread infection of hemophiliacs treated with nonvirally inactivated clotting factor creates fresh safety concerns for plasma-derived blood products, particularly because parvoviruses are relatively resistant to virus inactivation...|$|R

The contribution of African countries to global climate negotiations determines how compatible the negotiated rules could be with the existing socioeconomic and policy circumstances of African countries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the agency of Africa (African States) in the global climate change negotiations and discuss possible implications for implementing these rules using REDD+ as a case study. Drawing on document analysis and semi-structured expert interviews, our findings suggest that although African countries are extensively involved in the implementation of REDD+ interventions, the continent has a weak agency on the design of the global REDD+ architecture. This weak agency results from a number of factors including the inability of African countries to send large and diverse delegations to the negotiations as well lack of capacity to generate and <b>transmit</b> research <b>evidence</b> to the global platform. African countries also perceive themselves as victims of climate change who should be eligible for support rather than sources of technological solutions. Again, Africa’s position is fragmented across negotiation coalitions which weakens the continent's collective influence on the REDD+ agenda.

These include concerns about implementation capacity and a potential lack of coherence between REDD+ rules and existing policies in African countries.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The reduced size of {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) after endovascular repair suggests lowered intraaneurysmal pressure. In {{the presence}} of endoleaks, the size is not decreased. Although postoperative intraaneurysmal pressure is difficult to record, the pulsatile wall motion (PWM) of aneurysms can be measured noninvasively. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the PWM of AAAs before and after endovascular repair and to relate the change in the PWM to aneurysmal size and presence of endoleaks. Methods: Forty-seven patients underwent endovascular repair of an AAA. The aneurysm diameter and PWM were measured with the use of ultrasonic echo-tracking scans preoperatively; at 1, 3, and 6 months; and thereafter biannually. Fifteen aneurysms developed endoleaks, whereas 32 were completely excluded. The leaks were characterized with the use of computed tomographic scanning and angiography. Median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range, 5 to 24 months). Results: The preoperative PWM of the aneurysms was 1. 0 mm (range, 0. 8 to 1. 3 mm). After complete endovascular exclusion, the PWM was 25 % (range, 16 % to 37 %) of the preoperative value (p < 0. 001), and aneurysm diameter decreased by 8 mm (range, 6 to 14 mm) (p < 0. 001). After 18 months, no further diameter reduction occurred. In three patients without endoleaks but with enlarging aneurysms, the postoperative PWM showed less reduction (p < 0. 05). Aneurysms with endoleaks showed no diameter decrease, and the postoperative PWM was 50 % higher than that in the totally excluded cases (p < 0. 01). In five patients with transient endoleaks, the PWM was reduced after leakage ceased (p < 0. 05). Leaks of various sources displayed similar PWM. Conclusion: The size and PWM of aneurysms are reduced after endovascular repair. The diameter reduction may cease after 1. 5 years. Endoleaks are associated with higher PWM than expected.

Excitation is depressed by changes in membrane conductance throughout {{the duration of the}} inhibitory phase; moreover, since similar pathways from the periphery initiate both phases, excitatory events are limited to a duration roughly equal in length to the latency for the inhibition.

The inhibitory mechanism is temporally stable, however, and dominates the membrane during repetitive trains of volleys at 1 to 100 per sec. Artificially generated increases in the membrane potential decrease the IPSP while increasing the amplitude of the EPSP. Thus, both phases of the compound response appear to result from events occurring at chemically <b>transmitting</b> synaptic loci. <b>Evidence</b> is presented that these events are driven via collaterals of the same afferent fibers. The behavioral role of these response sequences is uncertain. Analogies, in terms of some observed reflex activity in these clams, appear to exist but presently lack experimental verification...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years our country has been {{affected}} by several outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Cholera and Hanta virus and recently, by pathogens associated to red tide. Chile was able to manage those emergencies using the local health system. The new threat that may emerge and could eventually overcome that capacity, is the possible H 5 N 1 influenza virus outbreak. Influenza {{is responsible for the}} most destructive pandemic, the Spanish influenza, that killed over 40 million individuals in 1918. The new influenza strain (H 5 N 1) is at present endemic in poultry in Asia and has been associated to human fatal cases in Hong Kong and Vietnam. Even though this strain is not able yet to be <b>transmitted</b> among humans, <b>evidence</b> has accumulated that such ability could be reached by the new strain, since it was already detected in pigs. That particular evidence may indicate that the virus could adapt to infect humans, since a similar situation was observed in several of the influenza pandemics. The World Health Organization set a "task force" to develop a strategy that may help to control the virus spread. Several countries are already stocking anti-flu drugs and others are developing new vaccine that are currently been assayed in human volunteers. It is possible that we may have a vaccine before the outbreak; this development is even faster than for SARS. The mayor question to be addressed for developing countries is: What will be done if {{we do not have the}} vaccine on time? (Rev Méd Chile 2005; 133 : 999 - 1001) ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundRecreational {{drug use}} in {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) is of concern because it might be linked to the {{transmission}} of HIV and other sexually <b>transmitted</b> infections. <b>Evidence</b> about {{drug use in}} HIV-diagnosed MSM in the UK is limited by representativeness of the study populations. We describe patterns of drug use and associations with sexual behaviours in HIV-diagnosed MSM in the UK. MethodsWe used data from the cross-sectional ASTRA study, which recruited participants aged 18 years or older with HIV from eight HIV outpatient clinics in the UK between Feb 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2012. We examined data for MSM, assessing the prevalence of recreational drug use and polydrug use in the previous 3 months and associations with sociodemographic and HIV-related factors. We examined the association of polydrug use with measures of condomless sex in the previous 3 months and with other sexual behaviours. FindingsOur analysis included data for 2248 MSM: 2136 (95 %) were gay, 1973 (89 %) were white, 1904 (85 %) were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 1682 (76 %) had a viral load of 50 copies per mL or lower. 1138 (51 %) used recreational drugs in the previous 3 months; 608 (27 %) used nitrites, 477 (21 %) used cannabis, 460 (21 %) used erectile dysfunction drugs, 453 (20 %) used cocaine, 280 (13 %) used ketamine, 258 (12 %) used 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA), 221 (10 %) used gamma-hydroxybutyrate or gamma-butyrolactone, 175 (8 %) used methamphetamine, and 162 (7 %) used mephedrone. In the 1138 individuals who used drugs, 529 (47 %) used three or more drugs and 241 (21 %) used five or more. Prevalence of injection drug use was 3 % (n= 68). Drug use was independently associated with younger age (p< 0 · 0001), not being religious (p= 0 · 001), having an HIV-positive stable partner (p= 0 · 0008), HIV-serostatus disclosure (p= 0 · 009), smoking (p< 0 · 0001), evidence of harmful alcohol drinking (p= 0 · 0001), and ART non-adherence (p< 0 · 0001). Increasing polydrug use was associated with increasing prevalence of condomless sex (prevalence range from no drug use to use of five or more drugs was 24 % to 78 %), condomless sex with HIV-seroconcordant partners (17 % to 69 %), condomless sex with HIV-serodiscordant partners (10 % to 25 %), and higher-HIV-risk condomless sex after taking viral load into account (4 % to 16 %; p≤ 0 · 005 for all). Associations were similar after adjustment for sociodemographic and HIV-related factors. Methamphetamine was more strongly associated with higher-HIV-risk condomless sex than were other commonly used drugs. InterpretationPolydrug use is prevalent in HIV-diagnosed MSM and is strongly associated with condomless sex. Specialist support services for MSM with HIV who use recreational drugs might be beneficial in the reduction of harm and prevention of ongoing transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} 30 [*]years {{the number of}} people who drink alcohol at harmful levels has {{increased}} in many countries. There have also been large increases in rates of sexually <b>transmitted</b> infections. Available <b>evidence</b> suggests that excessive alcohol consumption and poor sexual health may be linked. The prevalence of harmful alcohol use is higher among people attending sexual health clinics than in the general population, and a third of those attending clinics state that alcohol use affects whether they have unprotected sex. Previous research has demonstrated that brief intervention for alcohol misuse in other medical settings can lead to behavioral change, but the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of this intervention on sexual behavior have not been examined. Methods We will conduct a two parallel-arm, randomized trial. A consecutive sample of people attending three sexual health clinics in London and willing to participate in the study will be screened for excessive alcohol consumption. Participants identified as drinking excessively will then be allocated to either active treatment (Brief Advice and referral for Brief Intervention) or control treatment (a leaflet on healthy living). Randomization will be via an independent and remote telephone randomization service and will be stratified by study clinic. Brief Advice will comprise feedback on the possible health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, written information about alcohol and the offer of an appointment for further assessment and Brief Intervention. Follow-up data on alcohol use, sexual behavior, health related quality of life and service use will be collected by a researcher masked to allocation status six months later. The primary outcome for the study is mean weekly alcohol consumption during the previous three months, and the main secondary outcome is the proportion of participants who report unprotected sex during this period. Discussion Opportunistic intervention for excessive alcohol use has been shown to be effective in a range of medical settings. The SHEAR study will examine whether delivering such interventions in sexual health clinics results in reductions in alcohol consumption and will explore whether this is associated with changes in sexual behavior. </p...|$|R
40|$|Violence against {{sex workers}} can heighten their {{vulnerability}} to HIV and other sexually <b>transmitted</b> infections (STIs). <b>Evidence</b> suggests {{the risk of}} acquiring STI/HIV infections among female sex workers (FSWs) who have experienced violence to be almost three-times higher than FSWs, who have not experienced violence. Moreover, an experience of physical and sexual violence {{makes it difficult for}} them to negotiate safer sex with their partners and often act as a barrier to utilization of prevention services. This study utilizes data from 2785 FSWs aged 18 years and above who participated in a cross-sectional behavioural study conducted during 2013 - 14 in Thane district, Maharashtra. A probability-based two-stage cluster sampling method was used for data collection. This study assesses the effect of physical violence on self-reported STI symptoms (any STI and multiple STIs) and treatment seeking for the last STI symptom using propensity score matching method. About 18 % of sampled FSWs reported physical violence at the time of the survey. The likelihood of experiencing such violence was significantly higher among FSWs who solicited clients at public places, engaged in other economic activities apart from sex work, had savings, and reported high client volume per week. FSWs experiencing violence were also inconsistent condom users while engaging in sex with regular partners and clients. The average adjusted effect of violence clearly depicted an increase in the risk of any STI (11 %, p< 0. 05) and multiple STIs (8 %, p< 0. 10) and reduction in treatment seeking (10 %, p< 0. 05). This study demonstrates a significant effect of physical violence on reporting of any STI symptom and treatment seeking. Findings call for the immediate inclusion of strategies aimed to address violence related challenges in HIV prevention program currently being provided at Thane district. Such strategies would further help in enhancing the access to tailored STI prevention and care services among FSWs in the district...|$|R
