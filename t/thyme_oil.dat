40|$|Aim. It is a {{very hot}} topic to {{investigate}} the effects and the mechanisms of action of biological active extracts such as <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> on various cancer cells. This paper examines the ability of <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> to inhibit the growth of DLD- 1 colorectal cancer cells {{and if it is}} the case, determine the contribution of antioxidant effect to this ability. Methods. To do this, we treated human DLD- 1 colorectal cancer cells with <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> and assessed its effects on cell proliferation by using real time cell analyzing system (Xcelligence System). Furthermore, we applied the same concentrations to the L 929 fibroblast cells in order to determine if <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> has cytotoxicity on normal cells in the same concentrations it showed anticancer effects. Then, antioxidant ability of <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> was evaluated by using DPPH assay. Results. <b>Thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> treated DLD- 1 cells exhibited decreasing cell index values in a concentration-dependent manner. An inhibitor concentration 50 (IC 50) value of 0. 347 mg/mL was achieved. On the other hand, when <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> was tested on L 929 fibroblast cells, it was observed that <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> did not show cytotoxic effect on L 929 fibroblast cells.

Effect of carnation, caraway, <b>thyme</b> <b>oils</b> and the chemical fungicide Ridomil MZ 72 at various concentrations on mycelial growth of A. solani was tested. Carnation oil had the strongest and most extensive inhibitory effect on fungal growth. Slightly less effective were caraway and <b>thyme</b> <b>oils</b> followed by the chemical fungicide. Extended field trails for two cultivation seasons proved that the application of essential oils twice as foliar spray had a superior effect to the fungicide treatment for reducing the early blight incidence comparing with untreated control. An opposite relationship between the disease incidence and concentrations of applied essential oils was observed. The increase in potato yield also followed the same trend.

In order to test the effect of this natural feed additive, rich in <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> on the emission of methane by ruminants, five dairy cattle of Holstein breed were used and received a ration composed of 4 kg of industrial concentrated feed, 2 kg of alfalfa hay and 2 kg of wheat straw with free access to drinking water. After two weeks of adaptation to the feed, measurements of the production of methane were carried out without feed additive. Then, 50 g of the product rich <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> were daily added to the basic ration (7. 15 g/kg DM) during two weeks of adaptation and measurement of methane was taken in the third week. In the third period, 100 g of the same product was added to the same ration (14. 3 g/Kg DM), and measurements of methane were carried out after the two weeks of adaptation. The quantity of methane produced by the five cows was estimated to average 195. 9 liter/day. The addition of the product rich in <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> to the basic ration reduced methane emission on average by 21. 6...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{examining}} {{the use of}} essential oils as replacements for synthetic insecticides require {{an understanding of the}} contribution of each constituent present, interactions among these components, and how they relate to overall toxicity. In the present study, the chemical composition of commercial <b>thyme</b> <b>oil</b> was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <b>Thyme</b> <b>oil</b> and blends of its major constituents were tested for their acaricidal activitities against carmine spider mites (Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval)) using a slide-dip bioassay. Natural <b>thyme</b> <b>oil</b> showed greater toxicity than any single constituent or blend of constituents. Thymol was the most abundant component (34. 4 %), and also possessed the strongest acaricidal activity compared with other single constituents. When tested individually, four constituents (linalool, terpinene, p-cymene and carvacrol) also had activity, while α-pinene, benzoic acid and ethyl gallate had almost no activity. The toxicity of blends of selected constituents indicated a synergistic effect among the putatively active and inactive constituents, with the presence of all constituents necessary to reach the highest toxicity. The results indicated that <b>thyme</b> <b>oil</b> and some of its major constituents have the potential to be developed into botanical acaricides...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine inhibitory activities of four volatile plant essential oils (cinnamon oil, fennel oil, origanum oil and <b>thyme</b> <b>oil)</b> on in vitro growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae causing Fusarium wilt of strawberry plants. Results showed that these essential oils inhibited in vitro conidial germination and mycelial growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae in a dose-dependent manner. Cinnamon oil was found to be most effective one in suppressing conidial germination while fennel oil, origanum oil and <b>thyme</b> <b>oil</b> showed moderate inhibition of conidial germination at similar levels. Cinnamon oil, origanum oil and <b>thyme</b> <b>oil</b> showed moderate antifungal activities against mycelial growth at similar levels while fennel oil had relatively lower antifungal activity against mycelial growth. Antifungal effects of these four plant essential oils in different combinations on in vitro fungal growth were also evaluated. These essential oils demonstrated synergistic antifungal activities against conidial germination and mycelial growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae in vitro. Simultaneous application of origanum oil and <b>thyme</b> <b>oil</b> enhanced their antimicrobial activities against conidial germination and fungal mycelial growth. These results underpin that volatile plant essential oils could be used in eco-friendly integrated disease management of Fusarium wilt in strawberry fields...|$|E
40|$|Antifungal {{activity}} of <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> against Monilinia fructigena {{and development of}} an effective and stable oil formulation for agricultural use were studied in this paper. Bio{{activity of}} the oil itself and its developed formulation, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), was tested in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments, using a slightly modified agar overlay tech-nique, showed that the initially emulsified <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil,</b> {{as well as the}} developed for-mulation, significantly inhibited mycelial growth of M. fructigena in vitro. Experiments in vivo, performed on inoculated apple fruits, revealed that the formulation successfully decreased oil evaporation from the treated area and provided a significant level of M. fructigena sup-pression, 64. 7 - 72. 1 % compared to the control. To our knowledge, an EC formulation of <b>thyme</b> essential <b>oil</b> for agricultural uses had never been developed before. The presented results are initial findings and evaluation of product activity should be continued in the field to deter-mine its efficacy and activity spectrum, and to estimate the economic aspect of its use...|$|R
