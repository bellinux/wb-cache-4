5|$|Hurricane Pauline was {{the deadliest}} storm of the season. Landslides and {{flooding}} caused by heavy rain caused tragic {{loss of life}} and left thousands homeless. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 230 casualties. The Red Cross reported that 400people died, but this was disputed by Mexican officials. Pauline was Mexico's deadliest hurricane since 1976's Liza. In addition, the hurricane caused $447.8million in damage (1997USD; $473million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, Indonesia {{moved their}} first {{battalion}} of the Korps Komando Operasi (KKO) from Surabaya to Sebatik and opened several training camps {{near the border}} in eastern Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan).

5|$|In the {{official}} Atlantic hurricane database, which {{dates back to}} 1851, the first storm to occur outside of the current season was in 1865 in the Caribbean Sea. In the database, 81 tropical or subtropical cyclones have existed between December and May, most recently Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five storms in May and another in December {{before the start of}} {{the official}} database.|$|E
5|$|The localists' main stronghold was in Berlin, {{although}} localist unions {{existed in}} the rest of the Empire as well. Masons, carpenters, and some metal-working professions—especially those requiring a higher degree of qualification like coppersmiths or gold and silver workers—were represented in large numbers. By 1891, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 20,000 metal workers in localist trade unions, just as many as in the centralized German Metal Workers' Union.|$|E
5|$|At {{its final}} {{landfall}} in Guangdong, Imbudo produced strong winds, with a peak gust of 200km/h (124mph) measured at Shangchuan Island. At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159km/h (99mph), causing eleven boats to sink. There, over 10,000trees fell {{due to the}} strong winds, more than half in the city, and 7,649homes were damaged or destroyed. In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and water pumps, leaving residents without access to water. Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000chickens. Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000houses and caused ¥1.9billion (CNY, $230million USD). <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> eight deaths in the province.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However that provision {{did not become}} operative until <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 100 alumni in 1872. Cornell {{was one of the}} first Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was probably the first to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E
5|$|By 1500, the {{population}} had expanded considerably. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five mound centers (although the Shoulderbone site's population had declined dramatically) and several hundred smaller towns and other settlements. Ocute enters {{the historical record}} in the chronicles of the expedition of Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto, which came through the chiefdom in 1539 {{on its way to}} Cofitachequi. They had learned about Ocute from two young men they had captured in Apalachee in present-day Florida.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{animal and}} plant life {{correspond}} to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and acacia trees grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country.|$|E

On July 26, Black Lives Matter held a protest in Austin, Texas, to mark the third anniversary of the {{shooting}} death of Larry Jackson Jr. On July 28, Chicago Police Department officers shot Paul O'Neal in the back and killed him following a car chase. After the shooting, hundred marched in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{contains}} also {{an outstanding}} collection of monuments of Jewish sacred architecture unmatched anywhere in Poland. Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, with all its manifestations of religious observance from Orthodox to Chasidic and Reform flourishing side by side. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the Nazi German invasion of Poland, serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60,000–80,000 (out of the city's total population of 237,000), established since the early 12th century.|$|E

5|$|The 1869 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the earliest {{season in the}} Atlantic hurricane database in which <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ten tropical cyclones. Initially {{there were only three}} known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved in the actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E

5|$|Besides K. langenbergensis, other {{crocodilians}} {{from the}} Langenberg Quarry include the marine Machimosaurus hugii and Steneosaurus aff. brevirostris, {{which would have}} lived offshore and fed on turtles and fish; and the amphibious generalist Goniopholis simus, which subsisted on a diet of both shelly and soft prey like modern alligators. The quarry is best-known as the type locality of the brachiosaurid sauropod dinosaur Europasaurus holgeri, which was an insular dwarf. Isolated teeth show that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four different types of theropods present at the locality, including the megalosaurid Torvosaurus sp. {{as well as an}} additional megalosaurid and indeterminate members of the Allosauridae and Ceratosauria; theropod tracks from two different species (not identifiable to the family level) are also known. Remains attributable to diplodocids (possibly also dwarfed) and stegosaurs have also been found, alongside an indeterminate dsungaripterid pterosaur.|$|E
5|$|By December 2009 {{mephedrone}} {{was available}} {{on at least}} 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 78 online shops, half of which sold amounts of less than 200grams and half that also sold bulk quantities. The price per gram varied from £9.50 to £14. Between July 2009 and February 2010, UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Services (NPIS) entry on mephedrone 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries; the requests increased month on month over this period. In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times. After mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 {{season in the}} {{starting}} eleven under yet another new manager, Kenny Jackett, but soon lost his place amid competition from new signing Kevin McDonald and two younger midfielders, Lee Evans and Jack Price. On his last start for Wolves, on 16 November, he was reportedly fortunate not to be sent off before being substituted at half-time. Thereafter he played only 54 minutes of first-team football as the team were promoted back to the Championship at the first attempt, and although Jackett insisted that {{he still had a}} future at the club, Davis became frustrated. Ahead of the new season, Jackett suggested that, as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four players more likely than Davis to be selected, a loan move would be best for him. Barnsley of League One were interested, but terms could not be agreed.|$|E
