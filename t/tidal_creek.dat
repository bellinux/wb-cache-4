25|$|On {{the night}} of 8 April 1956, Staff Sergeant Matthew McKeon, a junior drill {{instructor}} at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, marched his assigned platoon into Ribbon Creek, a swampy <b>tidal</b> <b>creek.</b> The incident resulted {{in the deaths of}} six Marines recruits. In the end, McKeon was acquitted of manslaughter and oppression of troops. He was found guilty of negligent homicide and drinking on duty. The sentence was nine months of confinement at hard labor, rank reduced to private, a $270 fine and a bad conduct discharge. After a review of the evidence and numerous high profile Marines providing strong and positive testimony to McKeon's character, the Secretary of the Navy later reduced the sentence to three months in the brig, reduction to private with no discharge and no fine. McKeon went back on active duty. He was never able to regain his former rank and was medically retired from the Marine Corps in 1959 as a corporal by claiming a back injury.|$|E
25|$|The Adyar river {{originates}} from Malaipattu tank near Manimangalam {{village in}} Sriperumbudur Taluk at about 15km west of Tambaram and gains momentum as a stream from Chembarambakkam lake. It runs through Chennai for 42km before draining into the Bay of Bengal, forming an estuary, which {{extends from the}} Adyar Bridge to the sandbar {{at the edge of}} the sea, with some small islets in-between. Just before joining the sea at a sand bar on the shore, one part of the river takes off northward beyond the Chettinad Palace as a small inlet of water forming a <b>tidal</b> <b>creek.</b> The creek takes a U-turn near Foreshore Estate. It surrounds what was formerly called Quibble Island, stopping short of completely encircling it. The estuary covers an area of about 300 acres. The low salinity, good shelters, calm conditions and high plankton availability in the creek serves as a good nursery for fish. The flow of tidal water in and out of the creek allowed for easy travel of boats. It therefore encouraged fishing and there was a thriving economy of fish trade here. However, with the city's sewage and effluence from its various industries, for some time, emptying into the river, the biological activities in the region was affected.|$|E

25|$|At {{certain times}} of the year these beaches can be covered with dried seaweed from the {{extensive}} marine vegetation under the waters of Western Port, however when the seaweed is not in season, all of Somers beaches boast clean sand. The South Beach has an intricate system of rock pools, this is both of great interest to beachcombers, and something of a curse, as the beach is a difficult place to swim. The Merricks Creek Inlet is a <b>tidal</b> <b>creek</b> that flows with the tides of Western Port. About 50cm {{below the surface of the}} sandbed of the creek lies a darker sand that gives off a hydrogen sulphide smell when disturbed. Sand all these beaches is generally fine grain mixed with crushed sea shells. Small reefs exist in a few places and can be seen at low tide, but these are only rocky reefs incapable of supporting coral. At low tide these reefs can make navigation near the beach difficult for watercraft and are clearly marked with buoys. A succession of big storm tides came in on 24 March, 25 March, 22 April, 23 April and 15 June 2011, severely eroding the sand dunes east the Merricks Creek. In 2012, the wooden wall that had fixed that path of the Merricks Creek since 1974, was taken down, as it was deemed unsafe and not adequately performing its job anymore. Starting in July 2012 and finishing in September 2012, a new rock wall was built, to fix the creek on a path straight into Westernport. For the three and a half years the wall has been in place, a noticeable buildup of sand has occurred east of the wall, while considerable erosion has occurred west of the wall. In November 2015, the entrance to the Merricks Creek was filled in with a sand groyne, as a short term solution to the constant hydrogen sulphide odour caused by the breakdown of sea grasses within the creek. As of June 2016, the sand groyne is still in place, and as such the surrounding beaches have benefitted with the buildup of sand.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{recently}} opened and untidy thoroughfare with rudimentary side-walks {{and a soft}} layer of dust cushioning the whole width of the road. One end touched the slummy street of Chinese shops near the harbor, the other drove straight on, without houses, {{for a couple of}} miles, through patches of jungle-like vegetation, to the yard gates of the new Consolidated Docks Company. The crude frontages of the new Government buildings alternated with the blank fencing of vacant plots, and the view of the sky seemed to give an added spaciousness to the broad vista. It was empty and shunned by natives after business hours, as though they had expected to see one of the tigers from the neighborhood of the New Waterworks on the hill coming at a loping canter down the middle to get a Chinese shopkeeper for supper. Captain Whalley was not dwarfed by the solitude of the grandly planned street. He had too fine a presence for that. He was only a lonely figure walking purposefully, with a great white beard like a pilgrim, and with a thick stick that resembled a weapon. On one side the new Courts of Justice had a low and unadorned portico of squat columns half concealed by a few old trees left in the approach. On the other the pavilion wings of the new Colonial Treasury came out to the line of the street. But Captain Whalley, who had now no ship and no home, remembered in passing that on that very site when he first came out from England there had stood a fishing village, a few mat huts erected on piles between a muddy <b>tidal</b> <b>creek</b> and a miry pathway that went writhing into a tangled wilderness without any docks or waterworks.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>creeks</b> are {{relatively}} small coastal tributaries (< 1 - 20 km in length) that lie at the transition zone between terrestrial uplands, freshwater streams and the open estuary {{and serve as a}} link between terrestrial and estuarine systems. Despite their close connection to these systems, <b>tidal</b> <b>creeks</b> play a unique and integral role in the ecological function of coastal estuaries as: a source of high primary and secondary production, a site of nutrient cycling, a source of food for small-bodied fishes and crustaceans, as well as a foraging area for larger piscivorous fishes, wading birds, snakes and alligators, and nursery habitat for juvenile fishes and crustaceans of economic value, including the common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). <b>Tidal</b> <b>creeks</b> possess water quality characteristics that differ from freshwater systems and from the open estuary. As a result of their direct connection and close proximity to watershed sources of nutrient inputs and their smaller volumes and shallower depths relative to the open estuary, <b>tidal</b> <b>creeks</b> have relatively high nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations and low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels compared to downstream waterbodies.

25|$|Inundation and {{sediment}} deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by <b>tidal</b> <b>creeks</b> {{which are a}} common feature of salt marshes. Their typically dendritic and meandering forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, {{as well as to}} drain water, and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than salt marsh bordering open ocean. Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular trace metals, and can thus <b>tidal</b> <b>creeks</b> can affect metal distributions and concentrations in salt marshes, in turn affecting the biota.
