5|$|Portland {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{since at least}} the Mesolithic period (the Middle Stone Age)â€”there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants at the Culverwell Mesolithic Site, near Portland Bill, and of habitation since then. The Romans occupied Portland, reputedly calling it Vindelis. The Vikings first raid on England occurred in Portland in 789 AD, as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Three lost Viking ships from Hordaland (the district around Hardanger fjord in west Norway) landed at Portland Bill. The king's reeve tried to collect taxes from them, but they killed him and sailed on. In 1539 King Henry VIII ordered the construction of Portland Castle for defence against attacks by the French; the castle cost Â£4,964. It {{is one of the best}} preserved castles from this period, and is opened to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>by</b> the custodians English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|The IMD issued {{warnings}} {{related to}} the cyclone that were distributed to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>by</b> television, telegraph, news outlets, and other government departments. The All India Radio broadcast warnings beginning on November5, the day before landfall. Train service was disrupted throughout Andhra Pradesh, stranding thousands of travelers. India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation suspended operations during the storm. The storm caused local Diwali festivities to be canceled. It ultimately struck about 50km (30mi) north of where it was expected, in a region farther away from state shelters. About 225,000families evacuated due to the storm. However, about 30% of the towns in the region lacked a storm shelter, and the existing shelters were generally in poor shape. Some residents avoided the shelters due to their state of disrepair, or stayed in their homes for fear they would be robbed. In addition, storm emergency plans enacted after a cyclone in 1977 that struck Andhra Pradesh had not been used since 1986. Roads and shelters built following a cyclone in 1990 fared the storm better than older structures.|$|E
