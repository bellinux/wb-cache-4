25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

You're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> living {{together}} from {{the ages of}} seventeen to twenty-two and that's a growing up {{part of your life}} and we got to hate each other, no doubt about it. We didn't speak to each other for fucking years. Maybe ten years." [...] – Marriott ...|$|E
2500|$|... “I like <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> who don't {{have any}} power, and {{this seems like}} one of the least {{powerful}} people in the United States are migrant workers who come and do our work, but don't have any rights as a result. And yet we still invite them to come here {{and at the same time}} ask them to leave. And that's an interesting contradiction to me. And, you know, 'Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers,' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now... Migrant workers suffer and have no rights. [...] " ...|$|E

"Charles Lavington, you remember, was a solicitor," [...] Mrs. Milvain interposed, rather resenting {{the waste}} of time {{involved}} in <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> fictitious <b>people</b> when you might be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> real <b>people.</b> [...] "But you wouldn't remember him, Katharine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{say such}} queer things," [...] complained Felicity. [...] "You won't be really dead any time. You'll {{be in the}} next world. And I think it's horrid to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> being dead anyhow." ...|$|R
2500|$|Right-wing {{radio host}} Rush Limbaugh {{contended that the}} events were being blown out of proportion, stating that [...] "this is no {{different}} than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You ever heard of emotional release?" [...] Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, [...] "Instead of putting joysticks, I {{would have liked to have}} seen dynamite put in their orifices", and that [...] "we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less." [...] He repeatedly referred to Abu Ghraib prison as [...] "Grab-an-Arab" [...] prison.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, [...] "All {{the people}} who are attacking me right now for 'conspiracy theories' have no idea what they are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> ... <b>people</b> who assume the {{dominant}} narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." [...] To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, [...] "I stand by what I wrote." [...] However, in a follow-up Facebook post two days later, Wolf retracted her statement: [...] "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged," [...] she wrote. [...] "I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets." [...] Wolf did not say how it was possible to independently verify the videos posted by SITE.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Arbuton {{seems to}} have lived {{in a world where}} {{everything}} is regulated by some rigid law that it would be death to break. Then, you know, at home we are always <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people,</b> and discussing them; but we always talk of each person for what he is in himself, and I always thought a person could refine himself if he tried, and was sincere, and not conceited. But he seems to judge people according to their origin and locality and calling, and to believe that all refinement must come from just such training and circumstances as his own. Without exactly saying so, he puts everything else quite out of the question. He doesn't appear to dream that there can be any different opinion. He tramples upon all that I have been taught to believe; and though I cling the closer to my idols, I can't help, now and then, trying myself by his criterions; and then I find myself wanting in every civilized trait, and my whole life coarse and poor, and all my associations hopelessly degraded. I think his ideas are hard and narrow, and I believe that even my little experience would prove them false; but then, they are his, and I can't reconcile them with what I see is good in him." ...|$|E

50|$|Garrison also {{refers to}} the works of Émile Durkheim. She says that Durkheim <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> being in {{different}} types and categories. Determining what category they are in, could decide the reason they would commit suicide. “Durkheim’s categories are —egoistic, altruistic, anomic, fatalistic”.|$|R
500|$|In another {{interview}} he added, [...] "It was exciting {{to work for}} him [...] because he was so interesting when he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> a scene or <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>people.</b> One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before... He had such a great understanding... he loved actors so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He isn't patient now, and I'm afraid Jackson {{is paying}} for my fault. However, I really think I was patient, too. To <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> keeping their places is ridiculous; in fact, it's piffle! Father's notions are horribly out of date. One wonders he doesn't know." ...|$|R

50|$|Special {{care must}} be taken when <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> who perform under their own name. The actions of the {{character}} should be considered fictional events, wholly separate from the life of the performer. This is similar to other entertainers who perform with a persona that shares their own name (such as Kurt Angle and his fictional persona).|$|E
5000|$|Those in law {{enforcement}} argue that the show is a legitimate and effective way to catch auto thieves. [...] "John Q Public doesn't climb into bait cars," [...] a Florida officer states.

50|$|The third-person pronouns hän ('he' or 'she') and he ('they'), {{are rarely}} {{used in the}} spoken {{language}} outside of Southwestern Finland and are getting rare there, as well. Elsewhere, they are usually replaced by their non-personal equivalents. Unlike in English, there is no pejorative sense in <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> as 'it'. Animals, however, are always called 'it' even in written Finnish.|$|E
50|$|Gustafsson {{gained a}} certain degree of {{international}} fame following a World of Warcraft (WoW) joke in Parlamentet, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> wasting time on the internet and not contributing to their party's effort by playing inefficiently, using so much internal WoW terminology himself that he was incomprehensible to non-players. The scene was spread over the Internet, mainly on YouTube, where translations into other languages could also be found.|$|E
5000|$|Economic {{commentator}} Hugh Sidey {{described the}} crisis this way: [...] "We are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> {{who want to}} give birth and grow old and laugh and die, bonded and sustained by the soil, which is the oldest way of life Americans know.

5000|$|State Labor MP Luke Donnellan, who {{personally}} knows Ms Vo {{well from}} her community work, promised {{to file a}} protest with the Vietnamese Embassy. He comments, [...] "I will tell them how annoyed I am that they have arrested an Australian citizen and incarcerated her. It's totally inappropriate.

5000|$|Orelsan {{describes}} the song [...] "Suicide social", which was released as the album's fourth single on September 15, 2011 before the album's release, as [...] "really {{a series of}} clichés", adding {{that he would have}} been able to make the song last 4 minutes more.

5000|$|Kilicdaroglu {{criticized the}} European Court of Human Rights for rejecting a {{petition}} from a Turkish teacher who {{applied to the}} ECHR claiming that he was wrongly dismissed from his position during the 2016-17 Turkish purges.
