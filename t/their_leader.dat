As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother Olwë as <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by Ossë. They took Círdan as <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> and became the Falathrim. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the Sindar.|$|E

5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced into small pieces, {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged.

40|$|Despite {{the widely}} {{acknowledged}} importance of concerted efforts between service teams and <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> for increasing service quality, {{little is known}} about how and why congruent or divergent perceptions at the team-leader interface affect team perfor-mance. Drawing on theories from the field of sociocognitive psychology and from extant team literature, this study develops a research model that investigates crucial effect mechanisms of perceptual congruence between service teams and <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> on team performance. Perceptual congruence is operationalized by examining agreement between teams and <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> on three key team factors: service leadership, service commitment, and service systems. Analyzing leader, member, and customer survey responses from a large sample of service teams, we demonstrate that perceptual congruence between service teams and <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> can, in and of itself, have an impact on team performance. Moreover, our results reveal the relevance of nonlinear effect mechanisms arising from perceptual congruence. These patterns illustrate the pervasive and intricate effects of perceptual con-gruence on team performance, highlighting the importance of developing awareness of the alignment of perceptions in the rela-tionship between service teams and <b>their</b> <b>leaders.</b> Managers striving to encourage particular behaviors can use our results to direct customer-contact service teams more effectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine which motivating strategies followers desire from <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> and what motivating strategies are actually displayed by <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> to increase followers’ effort. Additionally, this research assessed the followers’ level of self-reported extra effort and the amount of extra effort followers perceive <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> exert. From this data, conclusions were drawn regarding the relationships between followers’ self-reported extra effort and the followers’ perception of their leaders’ extra effort. This quantitative research study was conducted via LinkedIn using Survey Monk ey and is based on Keller’s 42 item ARCS Model (attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction). Regression analysis of the survey responses indicated that: 1) Followers perceive <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> are not displaying the level of motivating strategies desired; 2) The amount of extra effort that followers perceive that <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> exert is significant in predicting the amount of extra effort that followers exert; and 3) Followers’ perception is that leaders’ extra effort is less than followers’ extra effort. The findings suggest that leaders should be more aware of the motivating strategies that followers desire and demonstrate those strategies since leaders’ extra effort is a significant predictor of followers’ extra effort. Additionally, leaders should also exert the level of effort that they desire from their followers...|$|R
