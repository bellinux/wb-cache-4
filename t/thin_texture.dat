60|$|She did sew. She plied her needle continuously, ceaselessly, but {{her brain}} worked faster than her fingers. Again, and more {{intensely}} than ever, she desired a fixed occupation, {{no matter how}} onerous, how irksome. Her uncle must be once more entreated, but first she would consult Mrs. Pryor. Her head laboured to frame projects as diligently as her hands to plait and stitch the <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> of the muslin summer dress spread on the little white couch {{at the foot of}} which she sat. Now and then, while thus doubly occupied, a tear would fill her eyes and fall on her busy hands; but this sign of emotion was rare and quickly effaced. The sharp pang passed; the dimness cleared from her vision. She would re-thread her needle, rearrange tuck and trimming, and work on.|$|E
60|$|The snail had now {{considered}} every possible method of reaching his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it. Let alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf, he was doubtful whether the <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> which vibrated {{with such an}} alarming crackle when touched even by {{the tip of his}} horns would bear his weight; and this determined him finally to creep beneath it, for there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground to admit him. He had just inserted his head in the opening and was taking stock of the high brown roof and was getting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the turf. This time they were both young, a young man and a young woman. They were both in the prime of youth, or even in that season which precedes the prime of youth, the season before the smooth pink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case, when the wings of the butterfly, though fully grown, are motionless in the sun.|$|E
50|$|Crema {{is similar}} to crème fraîche in flavor and consistency. Compared to sour cream, crema has a softer and tangier flavor, and has a <b>thinner</b> <b>texture.</b> Some recipes that call {{for the use of}} crema state that sour cream or crème fraîche {{can be used as a}} viable substitute.|$|R
500|$|Hinton {{played a}} crucial role in Sorabji's {{resumption}} of compositional activities. Sorabji's next two pieces, Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi and Symphonia brevis for Piano, were written in 1973, the year after the two first met, and mark the beginning of what several people have identified as Sorabji's [...] "late style", one characterised by <b>thinner</b> <b>textures</b> and a denser harmonic idiom.|$|R

60|$|Pelet's {{house was}} kept and his kitchen managed by his mother, a real old Frenchwoman; {{she had been}} handsome--at least she told me so, and I strove to believe her; she was now ugly, as only {{continental}} old women can be; perhaps, though, her style of dress made her look uglier than she really was. Indoors she would go about without cap, her grey hair strangely dishevelled; then, when at home, she seldom wore a gown--only a shabby cotton camisole; shoes, too, were strangers to her feet, and in lieu of them she sported roomy slippers, trodden down at the heels. On the other hand, whenever it was her pleasure to appear abroad, as on Sundays and fete-days, she would put on some very brilliant-coloured dress, usually of <b>thin</b> <b>texture,</b> a silk bonnet with a wreath of flowers, and a very fine shawl. She was not, in the main, an ill-natured old woman, but an incessant and most indiscreet talker; she kept chiefly in and about the kitchen, and seemed rather to avoid her son's august presence; of him, indeed, she evidently stood in awe. When he reproved her, his reproofs were bitter and unsparing; but he seldom gave himself that trouble.|$|E
60|$|If we now {{admit that}} many seeds which are either minute in size, of <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> or wavy form, or so fringed or margined as {{to afford a}} good hold to the air, are capable of being carried for many {{hundreds}} of miles by exceptionally violent and long-continued gales of wind, we shall not only {{be better able to}} account for the floras of some of the remotest oceanic islands, but shall also find in the fact a sufficient explanation of the wide diffusion of many genera, and even species, of arctic and north temperate plants in the southern hemisphere or on the summits of tropical mountains. Nearly fifty of the flowering plants of Tierra-del-Fuego are found also in North America or Europe, but in no intermediate country; while fifty-eight species are common to New Zealand and Northern Europe; thirty-eight to Australia, Northern Europe, and Asia; and no less than seventy-seven common to New Zealand, Australia, and South America.[180] On lofty mountains far removed from each other, identical or closely allied plants often occur. Thus the fine Primula imperialis of a single mountain peak in Java has been found (or a closely allied species) in the Himalayas; and many other plants of the high mountains of Java, Ceylon, and North India are either identical or closely allied forms. So, in Africa, some species, found on the summits of the Cameroons and Fernando Po in West Africa, are closely allied to species in the Abyssinian highlands and in Temperate Europe; while other Abyssinian and Cameroons species have recently been found on the mountains of Madagascar. Some peculiar Australian forms have been found represented on the summit of Kini Balu in Borneo. Again, on the summit of the Organ mountains in Brazil there are species allied to those of the Andes, but not found in the intervening lowlands.|$|E
60|$|But {{it is we}} who are the morbid exceptions; it is we who are the {{criminal}} class. This should be our great comfort. The vast mass of humanity, with their vast mass of idle books and idle words, have never doubted and never will doubt that courage is splendid, that fidelity is noble, that distressed ladies should be rescued, and vanquished enemies spared. There are {{a large number of}} cultivated persons who doubt these maxims of daily life, just as there are a large number of persons who believe they are the Prince of Wales; and I am told that both classes of people are entertaining conversationalists. But the average man or boy writes daily in these great gaudy diaries of his soul, which we call Penny Dreadfuls, a plainer and better gospel than any of those iridescent ethical paradoxes that the fashionable change as often as their bonnets. It may be a very limited aim in morality to shoot a 'many-faced and fickle traitor,' but at least it is a better aim than to be a many-faced and fickle traitor, which is a simple summary of a good many modern systems from Mr. d'Annunzio's downwards. So long as the coarse and <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> of mere current popular romance is not touched by a paltry culture it will never be vitally immoral. It is always on the side of life. The poor--the slaves who really stoop under the burden of life--have often been mad, scatter-brained and cruel, but never hopeless. That is a class privilege, like cigars. Their drivelling literature will always be a 'blood and thunder' literature, as simple as the thunder of heaven and the blood of men.|$|E
50|$|Mostly {{epiphyte}} herbs (with a few lithophytes) with laterally compressed pseudobulbs. One to four leathery or fleshy {{leaves are}} born {{near the top}} of each pseudobulb, and can be broadly ovate to oblong. The inflorescence is a terminal raceme (rarely a panicle). The flowers have 8 pollinia; petals are of a <b>thinner</b> <b>texture</b> than the sepals; sepals and petals are of similar shape, but the sepals being narrower; the lip or labellum is free from the arched flower column.|$|R
25|$|With the sonatas of 1915–1917 {{there is}} a sudden shift in the style. These works recall Debussy's earlier music in part, but also look forward, with leaner, simpler structures. Despite the <b>thinner</b> <b>textures</b> of the Violin Sonata (1917), there remains an undeniable {{richness}} in the chords themselves. This shift parallels the movement commonly known as neo-classicism, which became popular {{after his death in}} 1918. He planned a set of six sonatas, but had only completed three (cello, flute-viola-harp, and violin) before he died.|$|R
50|$|The musical {{landscape}} {{of this film}} is somewhat barren with very <b>thin</b> <b>textures,</b> often playing up the silence as a parallel to the quiet, isolated nature of main character Karl. Schipper specifically chose to use the music from the English band Gravenhurst because of their unique sound which is “a bit like Morriessey, sad, but still rocking.”Also used in the score for this film is the Lieder by Mahler, “ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen” (I am lost to the world).|$|R
50|$|Cladostemon kirki has {{leaves that}} are trifoliolate with obovate {{leaflets}} that are glabrous with a <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> {{and a common}} petiole up to 200 mm long. Twigs and branches are flexible and herbaceous.|$|E
5000|$|The final piece {{returns to}} a similar {{character}} and sonority as the first movement. A quicker 16th note accompaniment emerges from the <b>thin</b> <b>texture.</b> The lack of a strong final cadence brings this enigmatic piece to an ambiguous, but beautiful close.|$|E
50|$|The group {{adopted a}} musically <b>thin</b> <b>texture.</b> Although {{a few of}} tracks {{incorporate}} xylophone, most of the songs rely solely on drums and vocal harmonization. The drums are often pitched to add a melodic quality. The album features themes of encouraging good deeds, importance having good intentions, virtues of seeking repentance, {{the life of the}} Islamic prophets, preparations for the hereafter, hardships of life, negatives affects of intoxicants and the blessings of Allah.|$|E

5000|$|Pergolesi's {{setting of}} the Stabat Mater was already popular in Haydn's day despite criticisms of its not being serious enough.

5000|$|Because Faith {{himself is}} an award-winning pianist, {{many of the}} songs have {{sophisticated}} accompaniments. Sometimes the piano doubles the voice, though hardly ever through an entire piece. At other times the piano will play a countermelody to the voice to form a kind of obbligato. Like Debussy, Faith has a fondness for triplets, because of the movement and flow they add to a song. Thomas Nashe's [...] "Spring, the Sweet Spring" [...] (1950) {{is an exercise in}} perpetual motion for the accompanist, with only brief repose {{at the end of each}} stanza. This inventive, florid accompaniment, along with Faith's strict use of ABA form, <b>thin</b> <b>texture,</b> and a definite key signature (G) lend a neo-baroque character to this Elizabethan poem. The harmony, however, remains contemporary, with Faith's use of incidental chromatics and added-note chords.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} a summary and comparison of different optical measuring systems for free-form surface measurement {{according to their}} achieved accuracy. The investigation includes three fringe projection systems, two stereo image-based matching methods and one object-based multi-image matching method.

The reference body has been calibrated by a coordinate measuring machine whereby the measured 3 D points are used to calculate a NURB splines surface model. The resulting CAD model {{is used as a}} reference for the optical measurements. The surface has Lambertian reflectance properties, thus fringe projection systems can be used without object preparation. For photogrammetric matching the reference body is pasted by a very <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> foil. 1...|$|E
40|$|Dorsal skin {{reactions}} to continuous topical treatment with {{different types of}} corticosteroids were histologically investigated in hairless descendants of Mexican hairless dogs. The preparations tested were prednisolone (ST- 1; weak), fluocinolone acetonide (ST- 2; moderate), diflucortolone valrerate (ST- 3; strong), and mometasone furoate (ST- 4; very strong). Grossly, the sites treated with ST- 3 and ST- 4 showed moderate inflammatory reactions. After completion of the corticosteroid treatment, both sites were less pigmented and had a <b>thin</b> <b>texture.</b> The severity of histologic changes in the skin was dependent on {{the efficacy of the}} corticosteroids. The epidermis was prominently thinned from 1 wk after treatment with the corticosteroids, resulting in a flat dermis-epidermis junction. By the end of the corticosteroid treatment, these lesions became progressively more severe. At 2 wk after completion of topical treatment, the epidermal thickness in the sites treated with ST- 1 and ST- 2 began to return to normal values, whereas the epidermis o...|$|E

5000|$|This étude {{features}} distinct sections, {{almost invariably}} separated by powerful progressions in double octaves. After a short ad libitum cadenza, the main theme {{is presented in}} octaves accompanied by a flurry of thirds {{in the center of}} the keyboard, giving the impression of a horse galloping in a cloud of dust. The theme returns immediately this time with a <b>thinner</b> <b>texture.</b> After a thunderous chromatic scale in alternating octaves arrives the quieter [...] "Lo stesso tempo" [...] in which the left hand plays a modified version of the theme while the right hand plays sweeping arpeggios in intervals up and down the keyboard.

40|$|The {{potential}} for intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to evaluate arterial pathologies {{and to suggest}} invasive techniques thus far has been limited by its qualitative and subjective evaluation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop tools to automatically identify and objectively quantify the calcifications present in IVUS images of human coronaries. Human coronary arteries were dissected from explanted hearts within one hour of transplantation and perfused with saline at physiological pressure. IVUS images were acquired using an HP Sonos 100 system and a 3. 5 Fmonorail 30 MHZ catheter. A controlled pullback was recorded on SVHS videotape and images digitized every 250 μm. Texture analysis, consisting of the convolution with several different Laws’ matrices followed by texture “energy” extraction and nearest neighbor classification, was used to segment each image into high- and low-information regions. The regions of low-information content corresponded to shadows behind echo-dense features such as calcium. Calcifications were identified as sectors of radially <b>thin</b> <b>texture</b> regions that correlate with bright areas in the intensity image function. Angular percentage of vessel cross section with calcifications and angular localization of calcifications were compared with manual tracing in a set of 230 images from patients with different pathologies. The comparison showed a good correlation: Percentage correct: 86 %, Sensitivity: 79 %, Specificity: 89 %. No preferential angular calcification localization were observed. ConelusionThe results show that this is an objective method to clearly detect and quantify calcifications in IVUS images...|$|E
