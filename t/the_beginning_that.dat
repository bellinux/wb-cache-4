5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let me tell you at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> <b>that</b> night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

As soon as the line’s first unit, British Queen was delivered, British and American ordered the President. The plan was that by 1840, either President or British Queen was to depart each month for New York.|$|E
25|$|Kent {{was chosen}} to tour England in 1981. Greg Chappell elected not to tour and Kim Hughes thought at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> Kent was the most likely {{candidate}} to replace him at number three. However he failed during the early games and a score of 91 by Trevor Chappell saw him come into contention for the spot. Eventually Chappell was selected, with Kent relegated to 12th man.|$|E
25|$|Most menstrual cycles {{have several}} days at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> are {{infertile}} (pre-ovulatory infertility), {{a period of}} fertility, and then several days just before the next menstruation that are infertile (post-ovulatory infertility). The first day of red bleeding is considered day one of the menstrual cycle. Different systems of fertility awareness calculate the fertile period in slightly different ways, using primary fertility signs, cycle history, or both.|$|E

25|$|The local newspapers—the Chattanooga News and Chattanooga Times—recognized from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> Paige was special. In April 1926, {{shortly after}} his arrival, he {{recorded}} nine strikeouts over six innings against the Atlanta Black Crackers. Part way through the 1927 season, Paige's contract was sold to the Birmingham Black Barons of the major Negro National League (NNL). According to Paige's first memoir, his contract was for $450 per month, but in his second {{he said it was}} for $275.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense {{but that it was}} understood from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team and so we have here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} chant manual pretends {{right at}} <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> John of Damascus was its author. Its first edition {{was based on}} a more or less complete version in a 14th-century manuscript, but the treatise was probably created centuries earlier as part of the reform redaction of the tropologia {{by the end of the}} 8th century, after Irene's Council of Nikaia had confirmed the octoechos reform of 692 in 787. It fits well to the later focus on Palestine authors in the new chant book heirmologion.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Keefe {{retired as}} President of the ILA in 1908, succeeded by another Great Lakes tugboat man, T.V. O'Connor. O'Connor's {{presidency}} spanned {{twelve of the}} ILA's most intriguing and influential years. In 1909, a bitter three-year strike on the Great Lakes pitted the employers' Lake Carriers' Association against every maritime union except the ILA, whose locals wisely voted against participation because {{it was clear to}} them from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the strike was a losing battle. So powerful and well equipped was the Lake Carriers' Association that Lakes shipping ran almost regularly despite the union walk out. In the end, the ILA was almost alone on the Lakes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} book, Dumbledore fetches Harry from Privet Drive and takes him to persuade Horace Slughorn {{to rejoin the}} Hogwarts staff. Harry notices that Dumbledore's right hand is shrivelled and black. During the school year, Dumbledore teaches Harry of events in Voldemort's past that he feels are of immense importance. Using the Pensieve, they visit the {{memories}} of others, which contain important information about Voldemort's life and his genocidal rise to power. While using the pensieve, Harry sees a vision of Dumbledore's first encounter with Voldemort, then a disturbed young orphan named Tom Riddle; Dumbledore had known from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the boy was dangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.|$|E

25|$|Egypt {{went to war}} for a {{different}} reason than Syria did. While Assad wanted to regain lost Arab territory, Sadat wished to strengthen Egypt's position in its peace policy toward Israel. The Syrians were deceived by Sadat and the Egyptians, which would {{play a major role in}} the Arab defeat. Egyptian Chief of Staff Shazly was convinced from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> Egypt could not mount a successful full-scale offensive against Israel; therefore, he campaigned for a limited war. Sadat knew that Assad would not participate in the war if he knew his real intentions. Since the collapse of the UAR, the Egyptians were critical of the Ba'athist government; they saw it as an untrustworthy ally.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
25|$|The {{main body}} of the work states at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> it assumes prior {{knowledge}} of Immanuel Kant's theories, and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of transcendental idealism {{than any of the other}} later German Idealists. However, the book contains an appendix entitled critique of the Kantian philosophy, in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's ethics and significant parts of his epistemology and aesthetics. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. He also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has lingered in the school of Plato or he is already familiar with Indian philosophy.|$|E

500|$|Yomiuri Giants club {{representative}} Hidetoshi Kiyotake {{has expressed}} dislike of the system, because it enables Major League Baseball to poach players from Japan. By using the posting system, he says, Japanese teams {{make a profit}} in the short term, but by allowing Japan's best players {{to be sold to}} MLB, NPB teams and Japanese baseball suffer in the longer term. When Giants pitcher Koji Uehara asked to be posted in 2005, Kiyotake denied his request, saying: [...] "We don't recognize the posting system.

While the National Command invoked party rules and regulations against the Military Committee, it was clear from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>that</b> the initiative lay with the Military Committee. The reason for the Military Committee's success was its alliance with the Regionalists, a group of branches which had not adhered to Aflaq's 1958 orders to dissolve the Syrian Regional Branch. The Regionalists disliked Aflaq and opposed his leadership. Assad called the Regionalists the [...] "true cells of the party".|$|E
