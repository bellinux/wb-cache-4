25|$|As a result, Hogan filed a {{defamation}} {{of character}} lawsuit against Russo soon after, which was eventually dismissed in 2002. Russo claims <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a work, and Hogan claims that Russo {{made it a}} shoot. Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan's {{side of the story}} when he wrote that Hogan winning and leaving with the belt was a work (devised by Bischoff rather than Russo), and that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was an unplanned shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan. It was the last time he was seen in WCW.|$|E
25|$|Lymon's {{marriage}} to Waters was not legal {{because she was}} still married to her first husband. After the marriage failed, he moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, where he began a romantic relationship with Zola Taylor, {{a member of the}} Platters. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965 although their relationship ended several months later, purportedly because of Lymon's drug habits. Lymon, however, had been known to say that their marriage was a publicity stunt, and Taylor could produce no legal documentation of their marriage. In Major Robinson's gossip column of June 6, 1966, Zola said <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a joke that she went along with at the time (October 1965).|$|E

25|$|In Season 2, Lucas and Keith {{return to}} Tree Hill after Dan {{has a heart}} attack. Lucas tries {{to make up for}} his {{behavior}} with Peyton and Brooke and becomes friends with both of them. He also starts seeing a new girl named Anna Taggaro, but they break up amicably when Anna accepts that she is a lesbian. Lucas realizes that he has romantic feelings for Brooke and begins to focus on building on a relationship with her, even though she is seeing Anna's brother Felix. Lucas discovers that he has inherited Dan's heart condition, but does not tell anyone except Dan. After discovering that Keith's new girlfriend Jules was actually hired by Dan to break Keith's heart, Lucas agrees to move in with Dan if he leaves Keith alone and pays for Lucas's heart medication. This sets Lucas at odds with his mother, as she cannot believe that Lucas would want to live with Dan rather than her. It also causes a new rift between Lucas and Nathan, as Nathan feels that Lucas is replacing him and is bitter about Haley's departure to go on tour singing. Lucas and Karen are reconciled when she learns half of the reason he is staying with Dan, which is to protect Keith. This plan to protect his uncle fails when Jules leaves Keith at the altar and Keith leaves town after discovering that Lucas and Karen knew that she was hired by Dan. Lucas discovers Deb's painkiller addiction and decides to avenge all of Dan's victims. He finds a stash of cash and an incriminating ledger in the attic at Dan's dealership and plans to expose Dan's illegal dealings, but ultimately fails as Dan has also incriminated Deb. Dan then reveals that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a set-up to test Lucas's loyalty, which Lucas failed. As a result, he loses Dan's college fund for him (which Dan had been saving since Lucas was a baby) and even his heart medication. Nathan also ends his friendship with Lucas after discovering that Lucas had planned to bring Dan down and visited Haley behind his back in an attempt to patch up her and Nathan's marriage. Lucas does, however, kiss Brooke in the season finale and confesses that he wants to be with her, but she still leaves for California to spend the summer with her parents. Ultimately, it is just Lucas and a broken-hearted Peyton (after boyfriend Jake left her) for the summer and the last shot is {{of the two of them}} sharing a meaningful hug on the beach.|$|E
500|$|In America Epstein {{had met the}} {{well-known}} divorce lawyer, Nat Weiss, whom Epstein later asked {{to take over the}} merchandising affairs of the Beatles and NEMS. Weiss would later state, [...] "The reality is that the Beatles never saw a penny out of the merchandising... Tens of millions of dollars went down the drain because of the way <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> mishandled. Even after the judgement was vacated, you could smell the smoke from the ashes, that's how badly they had been burned."

500|$|In {{developing}} the game's graphics, Ste Pickford translated {{black and white}} sketches into the character maps in the game. For the bosses, {{the plan was to}} use the entire screen while involving as few moving sprites as possible [...] "to fool the player into thinking <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> alive". The same was done with the [...] "Dragon King", which was not one of the game's bosses; the dragon's head and neck were composed of sprites, {{while the rest of the}} body was considered part of the background. The dragon's neck stretched out vertically due to NES hardware sprite limitations horizontally.|$|E

500|$|M-10 {{was built}} in {{segments}} through the late 1950s and early 1960s. It carried several different names before the entire route was finally officially named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987. The freeway has carried a few other highway designations. The southern segment was part of US Highway12 (US12) and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> later renumbered Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696). From 1970 until 1986, {{it was part of}} US10, and the freeway has been M-10 since. The non-freeway segment that runs between I-696 in Southfield and Orchard Lake Road was previously numbered M-4. [...] M-10 was named after John C. Lodge, an influential Detroiter and Mayor of Detroit from 1927–28.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{recollection}} of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): [...] "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal." [...] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was [...] "almost nil", he and Ditko had [...] "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas.

500|$|Deriving from [...] "the biting {{humor of}} Ray Davies and the {{bitterness}} of Paul Weller", Albarn's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life. While Rubbish celebrates modern British life, it also takes a cynical look at middle-class existence. The overt Anglo-centricism of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture; James later explained, [...] "it was f***ing scary how American everything's becoming ... so <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a f***ing big two fingers up to America". NME summarised {{the theme of the}} [...] "thinly-veiled concept album" [...] as a [...] "London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters, peeping Thomases and lost dreams; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ... It's the Village Green Preservation Society come home to find a car park in its place".|$|E

500|$|Although mostly {{occupied}} with Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger, Derek Meddings briefly reprised {{his role as}} head of special effects to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car. The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: [...] "The car looked like no other piece of hardware we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped. Maybe <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, views the Jet Air Car as an update of Supercar, the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 series of the same name, but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the [...] "star vehicle" [...] of Joe 90, it is visually unappealing {{in comparison to the}} [...] "beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2005, Hardy {{posted on}} his website {{that he was}} finally [...] "free", that wrestling fans {{had not seen the}} last of him, and that he had a {{surprise}} for the fans who had supported him. That night on Raw, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge's match with Kane, leaving the commentators speechless. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they could see him at Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security had him in handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused and wondered if <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a bit of a waste of time." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite no lie {{detector}} or DNA test given, both are {{sentenced to death}} in the electric chair. In a bid to spare Marge, Homer says that he acted alone. As he is sitting in the electric chair, it is suddenly revealed to Homer that he is on a new reality TV show, Frame Up that airs on Fox TV. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> just part of an elaborate hidden camera scheme, the [...] "man with the braces" [...] was the show's host, and Mrs. Bellamy is guest host Carmen Electra in disguise. Homer and Marge are reunited with the kids, and Homer is angry that he had to suffer so the show could get higher ratings. Carmen Electra tries to explain, but Homer is too busy looking at her breasts. Chief Wiggum, on the other hand, is irritated that the police department used was wasted on what turned out to not even be a real case, but he learns he will be in the show and Eddie and Lou will be given producer credits.|$|E
500|$|Ottman had {{to compose}} {{music for the}} North African battle before the scene was shot, because booking space to record film music is difficult. Although he found that {{composing}} music based on the script results in overlong pieces, he felt the music worked out fine for the sequence. The film's end credits piece, [...] "They'll Remember You", is an original composition, but the lyrics {{were based on the}} poem [...] "Wanderer's Nightsong" [...] by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. An end piece entitled [...] "Long Live Sacred Germany" [...] was inspired by Adagio for Strings, in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene, but still fit with what was going on. Ottman described the original version of the track as a [...] "three minute drone that I slowed down with these two Tuvan throat singers, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> this horribly dark, morbid piece [...] left you cold". Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler, which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E

500|$|Rotten, meanwhile, {{suffering}} from flu and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious. On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, [...] "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." [...] That one number was a Stooges cover, [...] "No Fun". At {{the end of}} the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, [...] "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." [...] As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, [...] "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a joke at that point.... wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the crowds}} outside the stadium {{continued}} to grow, local police stations were mobilised, {{but by the}} time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put it mildly, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds. The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start, but that when King George V arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing [...] "God Save The King", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.|$|E
500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E
