5|$|<b>Tucker</b> and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while <b>Tucker</b> manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and <b>Tucker</b> begin having marital problems when it is revealed that <b>Tucker</b> {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need a break and before leaving town, she catches <b>Tucker</b> and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. <b>Tucker</b> supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. <b>Tucker</b> then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, <b>Tucker</b> had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so <b>Tucker</b> can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry <b>Tucker,</b> but Genevieve turned her back on <b>Tucker</b> and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to <b>Tucker</b> in order to make his margin call. Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail <b>Tucker</b> to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. <b>Tucker</b> decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations <b>Tucker</b> set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with <b>Tucker</b> and she rushed to his office only to find <b>Tucker</b> being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to <b>Tucker</b> as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive <b>Tucker,</b> which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, <b>Tucker</b> announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. <b>Tucker</b> and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits <b>Tucker</b> a lot harder than he would like to admit. <b>Tucker</b> is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves <b>Tucker</b> her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

On 26 May, <b>Tucker</b> arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and was decommissioned ten days later, on 5 June. <b>Tucker</b> was transferred back to the Navy on 30 June. On 1 November, <b>Tucker</b> was renamed DD-57 in order to free the name <b>Tucker</b> for a new destroyer of the same name. For a time, DD-57 served as a Sea Scout training ship at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 October 1936.

While Katherine and <b>Tucker</b> bond, he asks about his father, Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison), while Jill finds the information on <b>Tucker</b> and runs it in Restless Style magazine. <b>Tucker</b> and Katherine come to an agreement where she gets 51% of Chancellor Industries, but <b>Tucker</b> mistakenly believes Jill and Katherine were working together, and he promises to dismantle the company before their agreement comes into effect. Thanks to Jill, <b>Tucker</b> is investigated by the SEC while he bonds with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who is struggling with letting go of the child she thought was her daughter. <b>Tucker</b> supports her, much to the dismay of her boyfriend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), while he announces his plans to purchase Jabot for himself. <b>Tucker</b> blackmails Katherine into giving him back control of Jabot in exchange for him keeping quiet about Adam giving Victor access to the bids and he offers Ashley the CEO position.|$|E

However, Ashley decides against turning Victor into the feds to protect the company and her daughter, and <b>Tucker</b> agrees to obtain Beauty of Nature another way. <b>Tucker</b> supports Ashley when she must testify against Adam and helps Ashley get past her insecurities about their relationship as well her ability to work as CEO. <b>Tucker</b> goes ahead with his plan, and makes Jack co-CEO despite their plans for BON being stalled and they discuss using Abby to get to Victor.

500|$|Near {{the end of}} <b>Tucker's</b> third congressional term in 1824, Thomas Jefferson {{presented}} him with an offer {{on behalf of the}} fledgling University of Virginia, sanctioned by Trustees James Madison and Joseph C. Cabell, to serve as the first Professor of Moral Philosophy. The offer met the school's desire to appoint a non-Federalist to the post, and <b>Tucker's</b> connections with Cabell and St. George would also have facilitated his selection. Another factor was <b>Tucker's</b> recent 1822 Essays on Various Subjects of Taste, Morals, and National Policy, which included papers from the Port Folio. Madison had been provided a copy of these and recommended them to Jefferson, saying they were [...] "among the best answers to the charges of our national ...backwardness." [...] <b>Tucker's</b> selection may as well have been an accommodation to some of the school's opponents, including Episcopalians, Federalists, and notable western Virginians, many of whom were friends of <b>Tucker's.</b> Presumably, his prior monetary indiscretions were overlooked since no related formal charges were extant.|$|R
