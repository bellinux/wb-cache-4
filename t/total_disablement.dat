It now covers all clubs that release players for A-national teal matches listed on the International Match Calendar, including a FIFA commitment to insure the football tournament of the Olympic Games.The Club Protection Program provides compensation for clubs in the event that national A-team players participating for their national association suffer a temporary <b>total</b> <b>disablement</b> (TTD) as a result of bodily injuries caused by an accident. Players are insured up to a maximum of one year from the day of the excess period (= date of injury + 27 days) and a maximum of â‚¬7,500,000.|$|E
5000|$|The Vauclain {{compound}} {{was introduced}} in 1889 through [...] by its namesake and the then general superintendent of Baldwin and eventually president of the company, Samuel M. Vauclain. Soon most Baldwin customers were operating some examples; a brochure from 1900 lists sales to 140 customers, including large fleets to such Class I railroads as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, the Erie Railroad, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Norfolk and Western Railway, and the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. Many other lines purchased one or two as samples. Vauclain was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1891 for the locomotive design; in recommending award, the reviewing committee wrote, [...] "Your committee, in conclusion, find that {{in view of the}} state of art, the Vauclain compound locomotive is a distinctly new and original type of locomotive. It is the most marked departure from the usual construction of engines, that has elicited general satisfaction wherever introduced, and in view of the reliable and satisfactory performance in service under the largest variations of conditions, immunity from <b>total</b> <b>disablement,</b> ready adaptability within limits of space incapable of accommodating other compound engines, and general applicability to and utility in railway service, it is, in the opinion of your committee, deserving of recognition by the award of the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute, which they hereby recommend." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to the Church Committee report:In February 1960, CIA's Near East Division {{sought the}} {{endorsement}} of what the Division Chief James H. Critchfield called the [...] "Health Alteration Committee" [...] for its proposal for a [...] "special operation" [...] to [...] "incapacitate" [...] an Iraqi Colonel believed to be [...] "promoting Soviet bloc political interests in Iraq." [...] The Division sought the Committee's advice on a technique, [...] "which while not {{likely to result in}} <b>total</b> <b>disablement</b> would be certain to prevent the target from pursuing his usual activities for a minimum of three months," [...] adding: [...] "We do not consciously seek subject's permanent removal from the scene; we also do not object should this complication develop." ... In April 1962, the Alteration Committee unanimously recommended to the DDP Director for Plans, Richard M. Bissell Jr. that a [...] "disabling operation" [...] be undertaken, noting that the Chief of Operations advised that it would be [...] "highly desirable." [...] Bissell's deputy, Tracy Barnes, approved on behalf of Bissell ... The approved operation was to mail a monogrammed handkerchief containing an incapacitating agent to the colonel from an Asian country. James Scheider Advisor to Bissell testified that, while he did not now recall the name of the recipient, he did remember mailing from the Asian country, during the period in question, a handkerchief [...] "treated with some kind of material for the purpose of harassing that person who received it." ... During the course of this Committee's investigation, the CIA stated that the handkerchief was [...] "in fact never received (if, indeed, sent)." [...] It added that the colonel: [...] "Suffered a terminal illness before a firing squad in Baghdad (an event we had nothing to do with) not very long after our handkerchief proposal was considered." ...|$|E

40|$|A major {{component}} of the Genetic Discrimination Project (GDP), an Australia-wide study to examine {{the advantages and disadvantages}} for individuals of having genetic information and cases of alleged genetic discrimination, is the analysis of insurers' use of genetic test results. The peak life insurance body, IFSA, had collected data through the Australian Institute of Actuaries (AIA) for the period June 1999 -May 2003 from life insurance companies in Australia regarding their use of genetic test results in insurance underwriting. The GDP negotiated with IFSA and the AIA for access to this data for independent analysis. Applications from 288 individuals who had disclosed a genetic test result included products for cover for death, trauma/crisis, income protection/disability and <b>total</b> and permanent <b>disablement.</b> A <b>total</b> of 81 % (234 / 288) contained usable data for analysis. These cases involved the genetic conditions haemochromatosis (71 %), Huntington disease (12 %) and breast/ovarian cancer (6 %). In 49 % of cases, the genetic test result was described as the only influencing factor and of these, 32 % involved a "positive" genetic test result. Whilst underwriting in most cases appeared to be reasonable, the article highlights several cases involving disclosure of a positive predictive test result for breast/ovarian cancer that required further investigation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Effective {{methods for}} {{assessing}} visceral fat {{are important to}} investigate the role of visceral fat for the increased health risks in obesity. Techniques for direct measurement of soft tissue composition such as CT or MRI are expensive, time-consuming or require a relatively high radiation dose. Simple anthropometric methods, such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference or sagittal diameter are widely used. However, these methods cannot differentiate between visceral and subcutaneous fat and are less accurate. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate whether the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) method, possibly combined with anthropometry, offers a good alternative to CT for the prediction of visceral fat in the elderly. METHODS: Subjects were participants in the Health ABC-study, a cohort study of black and white men and women aged 70 - 79, investigating the effect of weight-related health conditions on <b>disablement.</b> <b>Total</b> body fat and trunk fat were measured by DXA using a Hologic QDR 1500. A 10 mm CT scan at the L 4 -L 5 level was acquired to measure visceral fat and total abdominal fat. Weight, height, sagittal diameter and waist circumference were measured using standard methods. Fat in a manually defined DXA subregion (4 cm slice at the top of iliac crest) at the abdomen was calculated in a sub-group of participants (n= 150; 50 % male; 45. 3 % Afro-American/ 54. 7 % Caucasian, age 70 - 79 y). This subregion, the standard trunk region and total fat were used as indicators of visceral fat. RESULTS: Total abdominal fat by DXA (subregion) was strongly correlated with total abdominal fat by CT (r ranging from 0. 87 in white men to 0. 98 in black women). The DXA subregion underestimated total abdominal fat by 10 % compared to the CT slice. The underestimation by DXA was seen especially in people with less abdominal fat. The association of visceral fat by CT with the DXA subregion (r= 0. 66, 0. 78, 0. 79 and 0. 65 for white and black men and women, respectively) was comparable with the association of the CT measure with the sagittal diameter (r= 0. 74, 0. 70, 0. 84 and 0. 68). Combining DXA measurements with anthropometry gave only limited improvement for the prediction of visceral fat by CT compared to univariate models (maximal increase of r(2) 4 %). CONCLUSION: DXA is a good alternative to CT for predicting total abdominal fat in an elderly population. For the prediction of visceral fat the sagittal diameter, which has a practical advantage compared to DXA, is just as effective...|$|R
