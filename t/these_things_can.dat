25|$|Due to the {{majority}} of the inhabitants being of peasantry stock, the Sasanian economy relied on farming and agriculture, Khuzestan and Iraq being the most important provinces for it. The Nahravan Canal {{is one of the greatest}} examples of Sasanian irrigation systems, and many of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>can</b> still be found in Iran. The mountains of the Sasanian state was used on lumbering by the nomads of the region, and due to the great centralization of the Sasanians, they also managed to impose tax on the nomads and inhabitants of the mountains. During the reign of Khosrau I, further land was brought under centralization.|$|E
25|$|Deterrence: Theories of {{deterrence}} claim that by sentencing criminals to extremely harsh penalties, {{other people who}} might be considering criminal activities will be so terrified of the consequences that they will choose not to commit crimes out of fear. In reality, most studies show that high incarceration rates either increase crime, have no noticeable effect, or only decrease it by a very small amount. Prisons act as training grounds for criminal activity, form criminal social networks, expose prisoners to further abuse (both from staff and other prisoners), foster anti-social sentiments towards society (law enforcement and corrections personnel in particular), fragment communities, and leave prisoners with criminal records that make it difficult to find legal employment after release. All of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>can</b> result in a higher likelihood of reoffending upon release.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{different}} causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is pica {{as a result of}} social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in pica.|$|E

2500|$|To define himself further, Descartes {{turns to}} the example of wax. [...] He determines that wax isn't wax because of its color, texture or shape, as all of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>can</b> change and the {{substance}} still be wax. [...] He believes that wax is perceived [...] "by the intellect alone" [...] (Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body). [...] Therefore, he distinguishes between ordinary perception and judgment. [...] When one understands the mathematical principles of the substance, such as its expansion under heat, figure and motion, {{the knowledge of the}} wax can be clear and distinct.|$|E
2500|$|Eliades Acosta, a {{prominent}} Cuban historian, {{head of the}} Cuban Communist Party's Committee on Culture and {{former director of the}} Jose Marti National Library in Havana, offered the standard Cuban interpretation of the sinking of the Maine (that the United States itself probably did it) in an interview to The New York Times. But Acosta adds that [...] "Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized. But others wanted to annex Cuba, and that should be criticized. If relations with the United States improve, all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be re-examined more fairly". This claim has also been made in Russia. Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at Komsomolskaya Pravda, speaking in a 2008 Pravda interview of the need in troubled times to change the psychology of society, to unite it, said that [...] "the Americans blew up their own battleship Maine." ...|$|E
