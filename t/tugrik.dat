40|$|AbstractThe recent {{financial}} crisis has required implementing specific macro approach of financial regulation and supervision. Thus, macro-prudential policy recently attracted considerable attention among global central banks. Therefore this paper provides {{an investigation of}} Mongolian financial systemic risk using macro-prudential frame {{and the way to}} avoid financial systemic risk. Dynamic provision was determined as a countercyclical macro-prudential tool to avoid systemic risk. Procyclicality, cross- sectional systemic risk analysis, and financial soundness indicators proposed that Mongolian financial system is at credit risk because of large banking sector. After {{financial crisis}}, although provision was 389. 64 billion <b>tugriks</b> in January of 2010, dynamic provision was calculated as 62. 64 billion <b>tugriks</b> that confirmed dynamic provision is countercyclical capital buffering tool...|$|R

50|$|Socialist {{development}} transformed Mongolia from {{a predominantly}} agrarian, nomadic economy in 1921 into a developing, agricultural-industrial {{economy in the}} late 1980s. In 1985 a reported 18.3 percent of produced national income was derived from agriculture, 32.4 percent from industry, 4.9 percent from construction, 11.2 percent from transportation and communications, 31.6 percent from domestic trade and services, and 1.6 percent from other sectors. Sixty percent of disposable national income went to consumption, and 40 percent went to accumulation. Fixed assets totaled about 38.9 billion <b>tugriks,</b> of which 66.5 percent were productive fixed assets, including livestock, and 33.5 percent were nonproductive. Industry and construction accounted for 38.1 percent of the productive fixed assets; agriculture, 16 percent; transportation and communications, 9 percent; and domestic trade and services, 3.4 percent. Investment totaled 4.624 billion <b>tugriks,</b> 97.9 percent of which went to the state sector, and 2.1 percent, to the cooperative sector. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1981-85), 68.9 percent of investments went into the productive sectors of the economy, and 31.1 percent, into nonproductive sectors. Industry and construction received 44.7 percent of investment during this period; agriculture, 13.9 percent; transportation and communications, 9.0 percent; and domestic trade and services, 1.3 percent. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1986-90) called for increasing produced national income by 26 to 29 percent and for raising investment by 24 to 26 percent, of which 70 percent {{was to go to}} developing material production.|$|R
50|$|Reform of {{management}} and planning began in 1986 with {{the first of several}} rounds of reorganization of governmental bodies dealing with the economy. These changes rationalized and streamlined state economic organizations; reduced the number of administrative positions by 3,000; and saved 20 million <b>tugriks</b> between 1986 and 1988. The role of the central planning bodies was to be reduced by limiting the duties of the State Planning and Economic Committee to overseeing general capital-investment policy. The indicators specified in the five-year and the annual national economic plans also were to be decreased. State committees and ministries, rather than the State Planning and Economic Committee, were to decide upon machinery and equipment purchases. Decentralization of economic management also was to extend to aimag and city administrations and enterprises. These bodies were given greater autonomy in construction and production, and they also were held financially responsible for profits and losses.|$|R
50|$|A seventeen-year-old {{young woman}} with a 17-day-old baby was sentenced to {{imprisonment}} for 10 years and 5 months for stealing 1,500 <b>tugriks</b> (equivalent of 1 USD). Amended 2005 Criminal Code of Mongolia had harsher criminal sentences for repeated incidents and minimum imprisonment was 10 years for stealing cases no matter the amount of damage done to society. This strategic litigation case was a high-profile case that attracted public and media attention. Law and policy-makers were very interested in this case and used as an example of scale of justice as compared to justice for the rich and poor. The main aim of this case was to create awareness on the equality before the law and court, advocate the principles of humane and just punishment, alternative sentencing and reform the Criminal Law and whole criminal justice system in Mongolia. The President of Mongolia, M. Enkhbayar, pardoned the woman and this was the most successfully tried case in Mongolia that people learned about a new concept of strategic litigation.|$|R
50|$|Secondary trading {{finally began}} on 28 August 1995, open to both {{domestic}} and international investors. Bids were placed on 430 out of 475 listed stocks, and trading occurred in 16 stocks; total turnover was 12,776 shares worth MNT2.2 million <b>tugriks</b> (US$4,850). The largest gain was in Sor, which rose by 19% from MNT580 to MNT690. However, the secondary market quickly exposed the weakness {{of many of the}} newly privatised companies; share prices remained depressed throughout 1996, and the number of MSE-listed companies contracted from 475 to 402. Market capitalisation stabilised around MNT15 billion in 1997, with a daily turnover of 80,000 to 300,000 from MNT16 - 80 million. Furthermore, many small shareholders sold their shares, allowing a few domestic and foreign investors to gain majority holdings in the remaining listed companies. The total number of shareholders had shrunk to a mere 135,000 by 1997. One public offering of additional shares from an already-listed enterprise was carried out in 1996, but the regulators refused to give approval for initial public offerings by new private companies, {{due to the lack of}} regulation and experience in underwriting. In 1998, the exchange moved to electronic trading. In 2000, the exchange also began to offer trading facilities for Mongolian government bonds. As of December 2003, market capitalisation in local terms had expanded to MNT52 billion, which was still a mere 5% of GDP. Only 30 of the companies listed on the exchange were actively traded.|$|R
