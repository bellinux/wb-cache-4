40|$|Extract This Federal Court {{decision}} 1 concerns {{misuse of}} confidential information {{by a former}} employee of Bluscope Steel. After his retirement, the respondent provided information to a foreign corporation as a paid consultant. Bluescope’s action was heard by Emmett J, who held that much of that information was derived from a secret Bluescope research project concerned with innovative steel-making processes on which the respondent had worked. In evidence, the respondent tried, but failed, {{to demonstrate that the}} information had been derived from public source, or resulted from his broader steel-making experience. The court granted an injunction and an account of profits calculated by reference to consultancy fees obtained from the foreign company. Interesting parallels arise on the facts with the recent case of Woolworths Limited v Mark Konrad Olson 2 (Woolworths). The case demonstrates that the court will grant an account for a breach of an express contractual duty of confidence while making an allowance for the respondent’s own efforts and know-how. The court also granted an injunction in broad terms relating to all information derived, from a secret research project, beyond what the applicant had been able <b>to</b> <b>itemise</b> during proceedings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} Iraqis in the Swedish labour market. The main {{goal was to}} point out on {{positive}} aspects of the Swedish labour market integration. Previous studies were mostly problem oriented on immigrants’ situation in finding a job, especially when related to immigrant from non-European countries. Instead this study {{is focused on the}} more positive aspects. It was attempted to answer which public resources respectively which individual assets were of value in getting a job. This paper is based on a qualitative method, as five Iraqis with jobs were interviewed. To analyse the empiricism of this study the human capital theory and the theory of social capital were applied. Furthermore the impact of public resources on getting a job was taken into account in the analysis. The study shows that both public resources and individual assets were of importance in the pursuit of a job. The interviews showed that one’s education and social network weighed most when looking for a job. On the other hand internships were named as the most significant of the public resources. But finally it is to conclude that it is not enough <b>to</b> <b>itemise</b> influences but {{to have a look at}} their interaction...|$|E

40|$|Encouraging Ethics and Preventing Corruption brings {{theory and}} {{practice}} together in addressing the question: How are we to be ethical in public life and through public institutions? It is a major contribution to public sector ethics within Australia and internationally because it provides an exhaustive analysis of reform across a decade in one jurisdiction, Queensland, and then proceeds <b>to</b> <b>itemise</b> a best practice integrity system or ethics regime. Drawing on the extensive research of two of Australia's leading practical ethicists, this text is essential reading for all students and practitioners of applied and professional ethics in the public sphere. Part A of the text provides a preferred theoretical and conceptual framework which both justifies and guides {{the development of a}} public sector ethics regime. Part B examines the place of the individual within a world of institutional ethics. Part C outlines the Queensland governance reforms introduced since 1989 following the Fitzgerald Inquiry which exposed corruption in the police and ministry. The final chapter, the 'Epilogue', gathers the insights of earlier chapters and suggests a more explicitly ethics-centred approach to governance reform that may take us 'beyond best practice'. Clearly, while it is the Australian context we have in mind, we are confident that this is a text which addresses the quest for integrity and ethics in government wherever society is committed to social and liberal democratic ideals. ...|$|E

Most {{of the analysis}} on how to fight tax evasion focused on the ways to deter evasion through incentives to people not to evade.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Research Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The HIV {{epidemic}} {{does not}} only affect {{people living with}} HIV or AIDS but has a large impact on the children. They are being stigmatised by association. There is paucity in research on HIV stigma interventions. In addition, existing interventions aimed at reducing HIV stigma are not community based and very few are aimed at HIV-affected children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the change on psychological well-being of HIV-affected children after a Community based HIV Stigma Reduction and Wellness Enhancement Intervention, and to explore and describe their experiences thereof. This study formed part of a larger Community based HIV Stigma Reduction and Wellness Enhancement Intervention project. A mixed method convergent parallel design involving quantitative and qualitative data collection, analyses and integration of findings was applied. The sample was drawn from populations in the greater Potchefstroom urban area and rural Ganyesa in the North West Province. The children as participants in this study were children of PLHA in the larger study and were recruited using snowball sampling (n= 11) and were between the ages 15 and 21 years. The quantitative component utilised a one group pre-test-repetitive-post-test design which was analysed by using IBM SPSS (ver. 20) by comparing t-test scores and F-ratios in ANOVA. The qualitative component of the study employed a holistic multiple case study approach and qualitative interpretive description and data were analysed by using thematic content and document analyses. The results indicated no significant difference between the urban and the rural groups in the subscales and total scores of mental well-being. The results of the total scores projected that the participants’ mental health was in the region of moderately mentally healthy. The in-depth interviews confirmed the three dimensions of the subscales indicating that they have verbalised similar experiences <b>to</b> the <b>itemised</b> subscales of emotional, social and psychological well-being. The intervention was a meaningful experience to the children. They gained knowledge about HIV stigma and how to cope with it; as well how to build relationships amongst themselves and with the PLHA. They gained a better understanding of their parents suffering from HIV and other PLHA as well as support of one another being in this difficult situation. Conducting the project led to them becoming empowered to act as leaders in HIV stigma reduction. The results of the in-depth interviews showed that the children gained a greater awareness of the process of the stigma and experienced a general increase in their knowledge throughout the workshop and the project. They formed meaningful relationships with other children and deepened their relationships with their parents and other PLHA. The children were empowered through these interventions to advocate against HIV stigma despite the challenges they faced. They gained confidence and experienced personal growth through their participation in the project. It is recommended that the findings of the study be applied in education to raise awareness of HIV stigma among psychology students and for training of practicing psychologists on their role in reducing HIV stigma and enhancing well-being of the PLHA and those living close to them. It could also be meaningful if the intervention were to be used for practice purposes where support is given to the newly diagnosed PLHA and those associated with them. Further research can be done to test sustainability of the intervention in a different context and with a bigger sample. Master...|$|R
40|$|Activities {{involving}} Design and Applied Arts (DAA) {{appear on}} the curriculum for each cycle from primary to secondary school in France. At primary school (3 – 11 years) and secondary school (for 12 – 15 years), these activities are prescribed {{in the context of}} two disciplines: at primary, arts education and sciences and technology education; visual arts and technology at secondary. Later (for 15 – 18 years old) DAA becomes a discipline per se. DAA is taught in a discipline called “Sciences Technology Design Applied Arts” (STD 2 A). The STD 2 A curriculum provides multidisciplinary approaches and practice shifts based on design projects involving processes of acquisition of skills.

40|$|This output {{relates to}} {{part of a}} project to {{understand}} the souvenir culture associated with the Festival of Britain in 1951. The Festival was an important and visible part of Britain’s post-war settlement. The ideological construction of the Festival was complex, looking both forward and back simultaneously. Furthermore, the Festival was immediately undermined politically so that, by the late 1970 s, its aims and objectives had been successfully called into question. Notwithstanding this ideological reversal, the Festival remains a popular success. The ephemeral visual culture of the Festival, exemplified by the typographic embellishments of its buildings and the graphic style of its souvenir publications provide compelling evidence of an alternative future for Britain. The antecedents of Festival typography are identified {{as those of the}} early 19 C market town and seafront promenade. My article provides a detailed account of the origins and evolution of the specific typographic style of Festival. This is explained by reference to the historical development of ideas associated with modernism in a specifically British context and in relation to the utopian ambitions of post-war reconstruction. My recently authored book,'Design: Festival of Britain 1951 '(2007) extends my research interest in this area, by examining the popular experience of the Festival through the souvenirs produced to commemorate the Festival. Festival souvenirs are usually understood as ephemeral and populist. They are not the kinds of iconic objects usually described by design historians. Nor are they as widely known as their royal counterparts. This is the first attempt <b>to</b> <b>itemise</b> their significance in relation to modern social history in Britain...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Research {{is key to}} {{achieving}} global development goals. Our objectives were to develop and test an evidence-informed process for assessing health research management and support systems (RMSS) in four African universities and for tracking interventions to address capacity gaps. Setting Four African universities. Participants 83 university staff and students from 11 cadres. Intervention/methods A literature-informed ‘benchmark’ was developed and used <b>to</b> <b>itemise</b> all components of a university’s health RMSS. Data on all components were collected during site visits to four African universities using interview guides, document reviews and facilities observation guides. Gaps in RMSS capacity were identified against the benchmark and institutional action plans developed to remedy gaps. Progress against indicators was tracked over 15 months and common challenges and successes identified. Results Common gaps in operational health research capacity included no accessible research strategy, a lack of research e-tracking capability and inadequate quality checks for proposal submissions and contracts. Feedback indicated that the capacity assessment was comprehensive and generated practical actions, several of which were no-cost. Regular follow-up helped to maintain focus on activities to strengthen health research capacity {{in the face of}} challenges. Conclusions Identification of each institutions’ strengths and weaknesses against an evidence-informed benchmark enabled them to identify gaps in in their operational health research systems, to develop prioritised action plans, to justify resource requests to fulfil the plans and to track progress in strengthening RMSS. Use of a standard benchmark, approach and tools enabled comparisons across institutions which has accelerated production of evidence about the science of research capacity strengthening. The tools could be used by institutions seeking to understand their strengths and to address gaps in research capacity. Research capacity gaps that were common to several institutions could be a ‘smart’ investment for governments and health research funders...|$|E
40|$|As a Euro-African I wish {{to explore}} the {{validity}} of the idea that worldview factors are fundamental in determining the praxis of administration. From observation and experience, problems with the practice of administration appear to be generic, rather than primarily personal. (It was noted, however, that personality and temperament also play a role.) The enquiry focuses on Shona and Ndebele Christians in Zimbabwe. As the field of study is Practical Theology and to give a theological foundation for and, perhaps, at least a partial solution to some of the perceived problems, a nascent theological approach to administration is presented, together with proposed training courses in administration and leadership for Bible colleges. Because the notion of administration is somewhat abstract, a fivefold framework was used comprising Planning, Organising, Leading and Controlling, all performed within Time. Questions on the connections, values, perceptions, expectations and use of these components by Shona and Ndebele Christians were discussed in light of their worldviews. Although the intended research approach was social construction, the need for the framework undercut this approach somewhat. I also came from a moderately soft postfoundationalist viewpoint, using narrative practical theology. Six Christian leaders as co-researchers – three Shona and three Ndebele; three Pentecostal and three non-Pentecostal – shared their multicultural insights through personal anecdotes and narrative interaction. Chapter One, in two parts, begins with a personal anecdote and other illustrations highlighting some of the difficulties experienced with administration and its processes in a multicultural African context. The research question – whether worldview shapes the praxis of administration – together with sub-problems, is then outlined. The second section explains the research methodology. Chapter Two defines worldview and administration from both the natural and Christian perspectives, to clarify their nature and praxis. Some underlying problems are introduced. Chapter Three explores what constitutes administration in Christian ministry. Here, values and tasks are <b>itemised</b> <b>to</b> reveal the actual content of administration (at least from a local church pastor’s perspective) and some assumptions behind it. Chapter Four presents individual conversations with the six co-researchers. These personal responses begin to highlight the connection of worldview to administrative praxis and some initial issues arising there from. Chapter Five reflects group dialogues, which allow for cross-cultural and cross-theological views. Gender is introduced as a woman para-church ministry leader replaces a pastor. This provides further fusion of views. From there, Chapter Six examines the Shona, Ndebele and Christian worldviews in more depth. Two case studies are explored narratively, to identify how worldview factors impact the praxis of administration in specific settings. Chapter Seven discusses the group’s understanding of the Biblical perspective of administration. A tentative theological approach to administration is offered. And lastly, Chapter Eight summarises the findings, identifies the issues and presents some solutions. The focus for the latter is on possible administration courses for Bible colleges. Although not directly social constructionist, the team affirmed this approach. The intention here is to enhance this training and thus improve administration in Christian ministry for the wider benefit of the Church community.

40|$|Biodiversity is the {{combination}} of the words biological and diversity which combines the concepts of variety of plants, animals and microorganisms that exist, the ecosystems they live in and the genes they contain. We are blessed with abundant biodiversity in Malaysia. The humid tropical climate, great diversity of habitats and the old growth forests in Malaysia are favourable condition for the growth and evolution of flora and fauna. While the number of species in Malaysia is not known with certainty, it is estimated that there are 12, 500 to 15, 000 flowering plants, 1, 159 ferns and fern allies, 513 palms, 3, 000 orchids, 432 mosses, 700 fungi, 27, 286 species of mammals and 11, 736 species of birds exist in the tropical rainforest of Malaysia. We need to preserve and conserve as many individual species and ecosystem as possible because they serve different and important functions. Elsewhere, tropical rainforests, in particular, have provided many beneficial products ranging from natural medicines to biological control agents for agriculture. Therefore, we should not underestimate the importance of conserving biodiversity. Conserving Malaysia's biodiversity will benefit our future generations. To be able to monitor what we are losing or in danger of losing, scientists need work together to inventory what we have which involves census <b>to</b> <b>itemise</b> our biological resources particularly the threatened and rare species. Healthy ecosystem provides services such as fresh air, clean water and prevention of ecological disruptions such as landslides and floods. Forests play important roles in maintaining ecological balance in the environment. They are vital part of the carbon cycle. Forest reduces atmospheric carbon via carbon sequestration, absorbs it from atmosphere then releases. Carbon in the atmosphere is absorbed via the process of photosynthesis. The carbon is then deposited in the leaves, stems, branches and roots as biomass. It also becomes deposited in dead organic matter such as in litter, dead wood and in soils. How well forests will continue to remove carbon now being emitted by anthropogenic activities? How will this affect the rate of carbon increase in the atmosphere? This requires research on the roles of forests and plantations in carbon sequestration by quantifying the magnitude and roles of vegetation in relation to climate change. The impacts of land use changes on carbon storage should also be emphasised as they are vary widely depending on many factors such as soil impacts, residual biomass, duration and proportion of carbon removed from the site. This book will take the readers on a journey that will lead them to understand the species composition and diversity in the Malaysian rainforests and the ecological functions they play. It also provides some topics of interests, with some examples, with regards to endangered tree species in relation to list, categories, factors affecting them and extinction prevention. In addition, the potentials of mangroves, forest plantations and agricultural tree crops in mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration are highlighted. I hope that this book will contribute to the expansion of knowledge and serve as reminder to all of us our responsibility to ensure the survival to today's biodiversity for a sustainable tomorrow...|$|E
