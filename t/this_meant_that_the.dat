5|$|The former county {{boundary}} between Cumberland and Westmorland lay along the Helvellyn Ridge; <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> summit of Helvellyn {{was the highest}} point in Westmorland, making it a Historic County Top.|$|E
5|$|The City furthered {{its plan}} of {{renewing}} {{the area and}} took no heed of the PAC. In response, the PAC secretly submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places for the Milwaukee Avenue district. It was approved on May 2, 1974 by Secretary of the Interior Rogers CB Morton. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> City could not alter or destroy the houses using federal funds without a public hearing.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{fate of the}} Ashes {{would be}} {{determined}} by the final match at The Oval. Hassett warmed up with consecutive half-centuries against Surrey and Warwickshire. In the second innings of the latter match, he made 21 not out, holding the team together as Australia stumbled to 5/53 in pursuit of 166 for victory when time ran out.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> {{first time}} since 1921, no finals {{football}} was staged at North Hobart Oval.|$|R
50|$|With Federer's defeat, <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> {{first time}} since the 2004 French Open, neither Federer nor Nadal {{featured}} in a Grand Slam semi-final.|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} <b>this</b> match <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks took the 2010 Tri-Nations title with one match remaining, {{as well as}} the Freedom Cup.|$|R
5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Following several {{design changes}} to the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the RS-25 was to be {{replaced}} with a single J-2X engine for the Ares I second stage and six modified RS-68 engines (which was based on both the SSME and Apollo-era J-2 engine) on the Ares V core stage; <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> RS-25 would be retired along with the space shuttle fleet. In 2010, however, NASA was directed to halt the Constellation program, and with it development of the Ares I and Ares V, instead focusing on building a new heavy lift launcher.|$|E
6000|$|... “All {{was still}} around Davidson. Whether she had run on board or not, <b>this</b> silence <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Frenchman {{had lost her}} in the dark.|$|R
50|$|During the 1949 season, the Association {{had made}} the {{decision}} to re-affiliate with the Australian National Football Council. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> from 1950, <b>the</b> Association played under the national standard code of rules. Most notably, <b>this</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> throwing <b>the</b> ball in general play was no longer legal. Other rules, including the free kick for 'kicking in danger' which had been introduced under Association rules in 1947, also had to be dropped.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, ClubHouze {{changed the}} {{structure}} of the company to early learning through the creative arts. <b>This</b> change <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company no longer ran classes for children over the age of seven.|$|R
5|$|Less than threeweeks {{before the}} game, USC's Reggie Bush won the Heisman trophy ahead of secondplace finisher, and Texas quarterback, Vince Young. Bush had the secondhighest number of firstplace votes in Heisman history (O.J. Simpson) {{and the highest}} {{percentage}} of firstplace votes, while Young had a record number of secondplace votes. Bush's 933point margin of victory was the 17thhighest {{in the history of the}} Heisman voting. The third finalist was Matt Leinart, winner of the Heisman trophy in 2004. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rose Bowl would mark the first time two Heisman trophy winners had ever played in the same backfield.|$|E
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
5|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{received}} the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified {{as they had been}} posted from the same {{place at the same time}} and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beatles reached the top position, with the Hurricanes coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left the hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.|$|E
50|$|Qualification: Switzerland ended {{qualification}} for Group G {{in third}} place, behind England and Montenegro. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> {{first time since}} the 2002 World Cup, Switzerland did not qualify for a major international tournament.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{allowing}} a wheel {{order to be}} repeated on a monthly setting sheet. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> keys were being found on a regular basis, economies in excluding possible wheel orders could be made.|$|R
5000|$|Third, that [...] "a lunatic {{hospital}} is {{an instrument of}} cure". By <b>this</b> he <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> physical structure of new psychiatric hospitals must be designed to support {{the practice of the}} new specialty.|$|R
5|$|The {{benefits}} {{gained by}} Maunsell's modifications {{showed in the}} improved performance of the first batch of Maunsell S15s over their Urie-built predecessors. A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last of the S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who wanted to see who was working with a particular child or young person.|$|E
5|$|Zhiyuen {{first saw}} action {{during one of}} the opening engagements of the First Sino-Japanese War, in the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894. Each Chinese ship was paired with another in a {{supporting}} role in case of a signalling failure, with Zhiyuen and her sister ship grouped together. Shortly after the start of the battle, Admiral Ruchang's signalling mast aboard Dingyuan was disabled by its own weapons. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire Chinese fleet operated in these pairs throughout the battle without any central organisation.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> during <b>the</b> {{early winter}} {{months of the}} war, Germany had no choice than to {{transport}} {{the majority of its}} ore along the much further route down Norway’s heavily indented Western coast from Narvik.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{provision}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> External Relations Act {{continued to}} have the force of law until the legislature decided otherwise, and so the monarch continued to represent the state abroad when empowered to do so.|$|R
50|$|The Oberliga Baden-Württemberg still {{remained}} below the Regionalliga Süd after {{the reduction of}} the number of Regionalligas from four to two in 2000 but <b>this</b> reduction <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Oberliga champions in that year were not promoted.|$|R
5|$|After {{the failed}} August Coup of 1991 Boris Yeltsin and the Ministry of Finance of the RSFSR claimed {{authority}} over the Ministry of Finance of the USSR, the state bank and the Bank of Foreign Economic Activity. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> institutions could not carry out any orders {{without the consent of}} the RSFSR government. The Ministry of Finance continued functioning until the RSFSR government issued a decree completing its takeover of the Soviet financial system. It was succeeded by the Ministry of Economics and Finance of the Russian Federation (1991) and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (1992). The last Soviet Minister of Finance was Vladimir Yefimovich Orlov, and Vladimir Rayevsky was acting Minister during the period of transition.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15, Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was slowed {{by the number}} of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40, he reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, two of Hiryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:40.|$|E
5|$|Both of Mario Andretti's sons, Michael and Jeff, were auto racers. Michael {{followed}} in his father's footsteps {{by winning the}} IndyCar title, with Mario's nephew John Andretti joining the series in 1988. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Andrettis became the first family to have four relatives compete in the same series. With Mario sharing driving duties with sons Michael and Jeff at the 1991 Rolex 24 at Daytona, driving a Porsche 962, the Andretti clan finished 5th. Mario's grandson Marco completed his first full season in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2006, driving for his father Michael's Andretti Green Racing team. Marco {{finished second in the}} 2006 Indianapolis 500 and so became the first third-generation recipient of the race's Rookie of the Year Award.|$|E
50|$|Within 12 {{months of}} launch in 1960, Harp {{had become an}} {{established}} brand throughout Ireland. A year later it was launched nationwide in Britain. <b>This</b> success <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brewery’s capacity had to be expanded to meet demand.|$|R
50|$|The League of Ireland Premier Division {{performances}} in Europe <b>this</b> season <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> league received a coefficient of 1.333 added to their overall coefficient which now accumulated to 4.164. This {{gave them a}} ranking 38th place as shown.|$|R
50|$|While Frücht {{has always}} had a strong {{agriculture}} sector, its business sector has remained small. <b>This</b> has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> town has been affected by declining tax revenues. Nevertheless, its financial situation is relatively good thanks to capital reserves.|$|R
5|$|During 1999, {{domestic}} air {{ticket prices}} increased 9.2%, and another 17% the following year. By 2001, the domestic capacity was {{below the level}} before Gardermoen opened. Braathens and SAS started cooperating to set the full-price tickets on routes to eleven cities. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prices were identical on all the routes where both airlines flew, although they {{were not allowed to}} make such cooperation with discounted tickets. During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity. The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller type of aircraft, that would replace the 737s on some routes, and that would allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. <b>This</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
50|$|Fox International Channels premiered {{the series}} {{in the first week}} of March 2009 {{simultaneously}} in over 180 territories, making it the first-ever global premiere. <b>This</b> also <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series premiered three months before it premiered in Canada and the U.S.|$|R
50|$|The League of Ireland Premier Division clubs' {{performances}} in Europe <b>this</b> season <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> league received a coefficient of 1.833 added to their overall coefficient which now accumulated to 4.331. This {{gave them a}} ranking 40th place as shown.|$|R
50|$|In addition, regions have {{considerable}} discretionary power over infrastructural spending, e.g., education, public transit, universities and research, and assistance to business owners. <b>This</b> has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heads of wealthy regions such as Île-de-France or Rhône-Alpes can be high-profile positions.|$|R
