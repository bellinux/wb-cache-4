5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E

30|$|We {{will come}} back to this point. Though he venerated his models, Schott {{deviated}} from their methods and opinions in special cases. For example, he rejected Clavius’s demonstration of the parallel postulate (Schott 1661 : 73) and he rejected Kircher’s belief in trepidation, that is, in a third motion of the earth that does not really exist (Schott 1661 : 243). In case of doubt he preferred <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> instead <b>of</b> nonsense (Schott 1661 : 522): “Malo itaque nihil dicere, quam tam incerta in medium proferre.” (“For that reason I prefer <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> instead <b>of</b> bringing forth such uncertain things.”).|$|R

25|$|However, this {{transition}} {{was not without}} its difficulties, and during this period {{the belief in the}} effectiveness of the older methods of memory training (<b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the esteem in which its practitioners were held) steadily became occluded. In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the Puritans attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite absurd and obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish. Erasmus of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.|$|E
25|$|Bede's {{treatment}} of Chad is particularly problematic {{because he could}} not conceal that Chad departed from Roman practices in vital ways– not only before the Synod of Whitby, which Bede presents as a total victory for the Roman party and its norms, but even after it. However, Chad was the teacher of Bede's own teacher, Trumbert, so Bede has an obvious personal interest in rehabilitating him, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> his loyalty to the Northumbrian establishment, which not only supported him but had played a notable part in Christianising England. This may explain a number of gaps in Bede's account of Chad, and why Bede sometimes seems to attribute to Chad implausible motives. Chad lived at and through a watershed in relations between the Anglo-Saxons and the wider Europe. Bede constantly tries to elide the ambiguities of Chad's career, not always successfully.|$|E

25|$|During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the {{principal}} merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved {{in a way}} hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and rococo (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The {{main part of the}} wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps {{the upper part of the}} panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But Thomas Chippendale, Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture.|$|E

500|$|Edward Samuel Corwin, {{writing in}} the Harvard Law Review, praised {{the idea of a}} {{fundamental}} higher law of reason enforceable by judges and so endorsed [...] "the ratification which Coke's doctrine received in American constitutional law and theory". Gary McDowell, writing in The Review of Politics, called the case's influence [...] "one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> history". McDowell pointed out that it was never discussed during the 1786 Constitutional Convention. During the ratification conventions, despite Coke being mentioned, it was not during debates over the striking down of unconstitutional statutes. Also, other writings of Coke were brought up but never Bonham's Case itself.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{garnered}} criticism. Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge found major flaws {{with the}} film, writing, [...] "Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging {{at some of}} its most critical moments. It is too subdued for Scorsese-philes, too violent for the most devout, and too abstruse for the great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian stated in his review, [...] "I fear that Silence expired in the womb during that long gestation period. It is beautiful to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (<b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> over-long; Masahiro Shinoda's 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō's 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese).

Regarding Seo Hell in the Old English Gospel of Nicodemus, Michael Bell states that [...] "her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical, and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the Frau Holle of German folklore, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> underworld goddesses in other cultures" [...] yet adds that [...] "the possibility that these genders are merely grammatical is strengthened {{by the fact that}} an Old Norse version of Nicodemus, possibly translated under English influence, personifies Hell in the neutral (Old Norse þat helviti)." ...|$|E

By contrast, IGN Music criticized Knowles' vocals in the song, writing that she [...] "comes in over the low-end track with too much earnestness, drowning out the funky grooves with her piercing dramatic mezzo-soprano.

500|$|In the United States, Coke's {{decision}} {{met with}} a better reaction. During the legal and public campaigns against the writs of assistance and Stamp Act 1765, Bonham's Case was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation. Marbury v. Madison, the American case which forms {{the basis for the}} exercise of judicial review in the United States under Article III of the Constitution, uses the words [...] "void" [...] and [...] "repugnant", seen as a direct reference to Coke. Some academics, such as Edward Samuel Corwin, have argued that Coke's work in Bonham's Case forms the basis of judicial review and the declaration of legislation as unconstitutional in the United States. Gary L.

500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I advise you <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner.

500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, {{sort of like the}} Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E

500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?"

[...] Before the tour, critics claimed Hirst would be unsuccessful, citing his failure during his previous tour. However, Warner later wrote: [...] "Hirst, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> his batting, bowled excellently throughout the tour, and was of much more value as a bowler than his average would suggest". He further described him as the best all-rounder in England and noted that [...] "the tighter the match, the better he plays". Wisden was less convinced, and the report on the tour said that, as a bowler, [...] "Hirst, though by no means the failure he had been with Mr Stoddart's team six years before, fell far below his English form." [...] While commenting on his batting record, the Wisden report noted: [...] "The Australian wickets [...] in fine weather are rather too fast to suit the pulling and hook strokes of which he is such a master in England." [...] As he could not make the ball swing in Australia in the same way it did in England, Hirst used leg theory, bowling at leg stump with fielders close by on the leg side.|$|E
500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south. Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the beautiful little girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd has the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
