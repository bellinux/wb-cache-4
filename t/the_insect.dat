5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to <b>the</b> <b>insect,</b> thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>insect</b> {{circulatory system}} {{utilizes}} hemolymph, a tissue analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> body, while remaining in direct contact with the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open circulatory system of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E

5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. <b>The</b> <b>insect</b> circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E

5|$|The fugitives {{arrive at}} Elizabeth's house, where she tends to Steve, {{in the late}} stages of his infection. One of Steve's pustules erupts in her face, killing him and infecting Elizabeth. At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major drug developer. She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment.

40|$|Abstract. Flowers need insects {{for their}} {{pollination}} and <b>insects</b> rely on <b>the</b> nectar and the pollen {{as a food}} resource. But instead of visiting all flowers, <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> limit their visits to a small number. This paper presents a simulation {{of the behavior of}} <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> which results in a specialized perception of blossom colors and fragrances by <b>the</b> <b>insects.</b> A coevolution can be observed only based on simple interactions modified over generations by a genetic algorithm. The results show a mutual benefit expressed in more rewards for <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> and more efficient pollination of the flowers. ...|$|R

5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. <b>The</b> <b>insect</b> struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
40|$|Field cage {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to compare retention times between two inexpensive proteins, non fat dry milk (NFDM) and chicken egg whites, on glassy-wing sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca coagulata and Hippodamia convergens. Each marker was applied to <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> by either directly spraying <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> with a conventional spraying device or by exposing <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> to pre-marked leaf tissue. Subsequently, <b>the</b> recaptured <b>insects</b> were analyzed by either an anti-NFDM or an anti-egg white enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of each respective marker. Data indicate that both protein markers were retained well on both insect species, regardless of the application method. Generally, the topical marking procedure yielded higher ELISA values than <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> marked by contact exposure; however, both methods were sufficient for marking almost 100 % of each population for> 2 weeks...|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the bats}} use a {{sophisticated}} sense of hearing. They release sounds that bounce(echoes) back from <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> or objects in their path.

5|$|Like other insects, {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments.

The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place.|$|E

5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> world.
