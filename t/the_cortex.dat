5|$|Historically, {{the brain}} {{featured}} {{in popular culture}} through phrenology, a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to different regions of <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cortex</b> remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire. The brain features in science fiction, with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs (beings with features like partly artificial brains). The 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for cinema) Donovan's Brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro, gradually taken over by a malign intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is <b>the</b> <b>cortex,</b> which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. <b>The</b> <b>cortex</b> of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|In culture, the {{philosophy}} of mind has for centuries attempted {{to address the question}} of the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem. The pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> in the 19th century. In science fiction, brain transplants are imagined in tales such as the 1942 Donovan's Brain.|$|E
50|$|VA output targets <b>the</b> premotor <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> {{anterior}} cingulate <b>cortex</b> and <b>the</b> oculomotor <b>cortex,</b> {{without significant}} connection to <b>the</b> motor <b>cortex.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{perception}} {{of objects and}} {{the totality of the}} visual scene is accomplished by <b>the</b> visual association <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> visual association <b>cortex</b> combines all sensory information perceived by <b>the</b> striate <b>cortex</b> which contains thousands of modules that are part of modular neural networks. The neurons in <b>the</b> striate <b>cortex</b> send axons to <b>the</b> extrastriate <b>cortex,</b> a region in <b>the</b> visual association <b>cortex</b> that surrounds <b>the</b> striate <b>cortex.</b>|$|R
50|$|All stimuli {{received}} by the receptors listed above are transduced to an action potential, which is carried along one or more afferent neurons towards a specific area of the brain. While <b>the</b> term sensory <b>cortex</b> is often used informally to refer to <b>the</b> somatosensory <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> term more accurately refers to the multiple {{areas of the brain}} at which senses are received to be processed. For the five traditional senses in humans, this includes the primary and secondary <b>cortexes</b> of <b>the</b> different senses: <b>the</b> somatosensory <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> visual <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> auditory <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> primary olfactory <b>cortex,</b> and <b>the</b> gustatory <b>cortex.</b> Other modalities have corresponding sensory cortex areas as well, including <b>the</b> vestibular <b>cortex</b> for <b>the</b> sense of balance.|$|R
5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b> Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cortex,</b> which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} may not develop at all, {{or may be}} fused in the midline behind the aorta. These are {{associated}} with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys. The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of <b>the</b> <b>cortex,</b> or may develop in an unusual location.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> paralimbic <b>cortex</b> {{is an area}} of three-layered <b>cortex</b> that {{includes}} <b>the</b> following regions: <b>the</b> piriform <b>cortex,</b> entorhinal <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> parahippocampal <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> medial surface of the temporal lobe, and <b>the</b> cingulate <b>cortex</b> just above <b>the</b> corpus callosum.|$|R
5000|$|Dense {{connections}} to the hippocampal formation, <b>the</b> parahippocampal <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> ventromedial prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> and subgenual parts of <b>the</b> anterior cingulate <b>cortex.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> cingulate <b>cortex</b> {{is a part}} of {{the brain}} {{situated}} in the medial aspect of <b>the</b> cerebral <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> cingulate <b>cortex</b> includes <b>the</b> entire cingulate gyrus, which lies immediately above the corpus callosum, and the continuation of this in the cingulate sulcus. <b>The</b> cingulate <b>cortex</b> is usually considered part of the limbic lobe.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cortex</b> {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. <b>The</b> <b>cortex</b> {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of <b>the</b> <b>cortex,</b> are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b> Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{posterior}} cingulate <b>cortex</b> is <b>the</b> backmost part of <b>the</b> cingulate <b>cortex,</b> lying behind <b>the</b> anterior cingulate <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> PCC forms {{a part of}} <b>the</b> posteromedial <b>cortex,</b> {{along with}} <b>the</b> retrosplenial <b>cortex</b> (Brodmann areas 29 and 30) and precuneus (located posterior and superior to the PCC). The PCC, together with <b>the</b> retrosplenial <b>cortex,</b> forms <b>the</b> retrosplenial gyrus. <b>The</b> posterior cingulate <b>cortex</b> is bordered by the following brain regions: the marginal ramus of the cingulate sulcus (superiorly), the corpus callosum (inferiorly), the parieto-occipital sulcus (posteriorly), and Brodmann area 24 (anteriorly).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> pyriform <b>cortex</b> {{is a type}} of allocortex that {{corresponds}} to the rostral half of the uncus. Its strongest afferent connections are from the olfactory bulb. Although <b>the</b> olfactory <b>cortex</b> comprises all <b>the</b> “areas in the rostro-ventral portion of the forebrain which receive direct projections from the olfactory bulb,” including the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, <b>the</b> pyriform <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> entorhinal <b>cortex,</b> <b>the</b> insular <b>cortex,</b> and <b>the</b> amygdala, <b>the</b> pyriform <b>cortex</b> is considered synonymous with <b>the</b> olfactory <b>cortex</b> because it is “by far the largest cortical area primarily involved in perception and learning of olfactory stimuli.” It {{is a type of}} paleocortex, which means that it older than and has fewer layers than neocortex but is more recent than and contains more layers than archicortex. Along with the parahippocampal gyrus, <b>the</b> pyriform <b>cortex</b> is a chief component of paleocortex.|$|R
50|$|Visual {{information}} {{coming from the}} eye goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and then reaches <b>the</b> visual <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> part of <b>the</b> visual <b>cortex</b> that receives <b>the</b> sensory inputs from the thalamus is <b>the</b> primary visual <b>cortex,</b> also known as visual area 1 (V1), and <b>the</b> striate <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> extrastriate areas consist of visual areas 2 (V2), 3 (V3), 4 (V4), and 5 (V5).|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, <b>the</b> <b>cortex,</b> between the hymenium and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi (on a broader front) and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
5|$|As Crash gathers the {{remaining}} crystals, he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio, including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo, the scimitar-wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe, and the musclebound Tiny Tiger. During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until Crash has gathered the crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, Cortex will power the gigantic Cortex Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. Crash manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used, but leaves <b>the</b> <b>Cortex</b> Vortex drifting aimlessly into space. Crash redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; Crash activates the laser and destroys <b>the</b> <b>Cortex</b> Vortex, breaking the space station apart.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{posterior}} cingulate <b>cortex</b> (PCC) is <b>the</b> backmost part of <b>the</b> cingulate <b>cortex,</b> lying behind <b>the</b> anterior cingulate <b>cortex.</b> This is <b>the</b> {{upper part}} of the [...] "limbic lobe". <b>The</b> cingulate <b>cortex</b> is made up of an area around the midline of the brain. Surrounding areas include <b>the</b> retrosplenial <b>cortex</b> and <b>the</b> precuneus.|$|R
50|$|Odor identity, quality, and {{familiarity}} are mainly deciphered by <b>the</b> piriform <b>cortex.</b> Consciousness of smell {{is achieved by}} projections from <b>the</b> piriform <b>cortex</b> to <b>the</b> medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus and to <b>the</b> orbitofrontal <b>cortex,</b> which <b>the</b> secondary olfactory <b>cortex</b> is part of.|$|R
50|$|Two neurobiological {{models of}} emotion in <b>the</b> prefrontal <b>cortex</b> made {{opposing}} predictions. The Valence Model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate <b>the</b> right prefrontal <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> Direction Model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate <b>the</b> left prefrontal <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> second model was supported.|$|R
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b> Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making his way across the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to <b>the</b> <b>Cortex</b> Island. Crash then navigates <b>the</b> <b>Cortex</b> Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of <b>the</b> <b>cortex</b> to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, {{emotional}} responses are processed {{in a part}} of the brain called the limbic system which lies in <b>the</b> cerebral <b>cortex.</b> <b>The</b> main components of the limbic system are <b>the</b> amygdala, orbitofrontal <b>cortex,</b> thalamus and <b>the</b> sensory <b>cortex.</b>|$|R
50|$|In primates, <b>the</b> extrastriate <b>cortex</b> {{includes}} {{visual area}} V3, visual area V4, and visual area MT (sometimes called V5), while V1 corresponds to <b>the</b> striate <b>cortex,</b> and V2 to <b>the</b> prestriate <b>cortex.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{auditory}} <b>cortex</b> is <b>the</b> {{most highly}} organized processing unit of sound in <b>the</b> brain. This <b>cortex</b> area is <b>the</b> neural crux of hearing, and - in humans - language and music. <b>The</b> auditory <b>cortex</b> {{is divided into}} three separate parts: the primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortex. These structures are formed concentrically around one another, with <b>the</b> primary <b>cortex</b> in <b>the</b> middle and <b>the</b> tertiary <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> outside.|$|R
5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b> Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of <b>the</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game's story {{takes place}} {{immediately}} after {{the events of the}} second game. The ruins of a space station called <b>the</b> <b>Cortex</b> Vortex owned by Doctor Neo Cortex, crash-lands on Earth and unleashes an evil entity known as Uka Uka, Aku Aku's evil younger twin brother, who joins with Cortex and the time-obsessed Doctor Nefarious Tropy and they plan to gather powerful Crystals that lay scattered across time and use their energy to enslave the Earth. The game follows the main characters Crash and Coco Bandicoot as they travel through time and prevent the villains from gathering the Crystals by collecting them themselves.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> sensory <b>cortex</b> {{can refer}} informally to <b>the</b> primary {{somatosensory}} <b>cortex,</b> {{or it can}} be used as a term for the primary and secondary cortices of the different senses (two cortices each, on left and right hemisphere): <b>the</b> visual <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> occipital lobes, <b>the</b> auditory <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> temporal lobes, <b>the</b> primary olfactory <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> uncus of the piriform region of the temporal lobes, <b>the</b> gustatory <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> insular lobe (also referred to as <b>the</b> insular <b>cortex),</b> and <b>the</b> primary somatosensory <b>cortex</b> on <b>the</b> anterior parietal lobes. Just posterior to <b>the</b> primary somatosensory <b>cortex</b> lies <b>the</b> somatosensory association <b>cortex,</b> which integrates sensory information from <b>the</b> primary somatosensory <b>cortex</b> (temperature, pressure, etc.) to construct an understanding of the object being felt. Inferior to the frontal lobes are found the olfactory bulbs, which receive sensory input from the olfactory nerves and route those signals throughout the brain. Not all olfactory information is routed to <b>the</b> olfactory <b>cortex.</b> Some neural fibers are routed directly to limbic structures, while others are routed to the supraorbital region of the frontal lobe. Such a direct limbic connection makes the olfactory sense unique.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> premotor <b>cortex</b> can be {{distinguished}} from Brodmann area 46 of <b>the</b> prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> just anterior to it, {{by the presence of}} a fully formed granular layer IV in area 46. <b>The</b> premotor <b>cortex</b> is therefore anatomically a transition between <b>the</b> agranular motor <b>cortex</b> and <b>the</b> granular, six-layered prefrontal cortex.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> premotor <b>cortex</b> can be {{distinguished}} from <b>the</b> primary motor <b>cortex,</b> Brodmann area 4, just posterior to it, based on two main anatomical markers. First, <b>the</b> primary motor <b>cortex</b> contains giant pyramidal cells called Betz cells in layer V, whereas giant pyramidal cells are less common and smaller in <b>the</b> premotor <b>cortex.</b> Second, <b>the</b> primary motor <b>cortex</b> is agranular: it lacks a layer IV marked {{by the presence of}} granule cells. <b>The</b> premotor <b>cortex</b> is dysgranular: it contains a faint layer IV.|$|R
