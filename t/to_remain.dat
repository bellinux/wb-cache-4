5|$|On June 1, 2010, {{by a vote}} of 5–4, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Sixth Circuit's decision. In the Opinion of the Court, written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that Thompkins' silence during the interrogation did not invoke his right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent and that he had waived his right <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.|$|E

5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} efforts, {{there are}} unresolved questions on evolutionary {{relationships in the}} angiosperm family Rubiaceae. Here, information from six loci and 149 Rubiaceae taxa provide new insights. Acranthera and Coptosapelta are strongly supported as sisters. Pollen grains of Acranthera possess several features common in Rubiaceae, but amongst potential similarities with the unusual grains of Coptosapelta are {{the nature of the}} apertures and the structure of the sexine. Luculia, Acranthera and Coptosapelta are excluded from the three subfamilies Ixoroideae, Cinchonoideae and Rubioideae. Sipaneeae and Condamineeae form a clade, sister <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> Ixoroideae. Rondeletieae and Guettardeae are sisters <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> Cinchonoideae. Colletoecema is sister <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> Rubioideae, followed by the Urophylleae–Ophiorrhizeae clade. Nuclear ITS provided structured information at all phylogenetic levels, but the main gain from adding nrITS was the increased resolution. Average support values also increased but were generally high also without nrITS and the increase was not statistically significant...|$|R
