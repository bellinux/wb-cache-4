5|$|In 1851, the Oatman {{family was}} ambushed {{by a group}} of Ɖo:lkabaya Yavapai (though many historians argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to know whether or not these were Yavapai, or some other tribe). Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves as slaves.

5|$|The Tempest {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} {{to have been}} written in 1610–11, and is generally accepted as the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions. Scholars also note <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to determine if the}} play was written before, after, or {{at the same time as}} The Winter's Tale, the dating of which has been equally problematic. Edward Blount entered The Tempest into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean plays that Blount registered on that date.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E

In the note, Kate states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to prove his innocence. Harry escapes on a passing wagon, concealed in corn or hay, and returns home. The police gather and surround search the home, Harry escapes via a clothesline to another building, successfully eluding the police. The following morning, Harry buys a newspaper from a newspaperboy and reads of his innocence after the real thief confesses to the crime. The three rejoice at his proven innocence.|$|E

5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, {{did not wish to}} publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E

He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to read all of them.

Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), {{as well as the}} New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to be sure who was in command on the day.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points out <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine from these studies {{if any of the}} decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E

5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail is {{endemic to}} the Chittenango area of Madison County, New York, United States. There {{is only one}} {{population}} of this species at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York, {{even though it was}} believed to have a broader range previously; based on fossil records, some authors argue that the distribution of this species may have been much wider in the past. In opposition to this, other authors argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to identify this species based on fossil records, because they only allow for examination of shell features. Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive.|$|E

At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> for her to not love him.|$|E

Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him.

He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E

5|$|Some {{members of}} the Viking metal scene believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> for someone to be a Viking unless they {{themselves}} are of northern European descent. According to Trafford and Pluskowski, the members of practically all Viking metal bands claim Viking ancestry, and after its inception in Scandinavia, Viking metal spread to areas historically settled by Vikings, including England, Russia, and Normandy. Viking metal bands have even formed in the United States and Canada, with their members claiming Viking descent either directly from Scandinavia or through England. The scene also spread {{to other parts of}} Northern Europe in areas united by a common Germanic heritage, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. For instance, the Austrian band Valhalla makes extensive use of Viking iconography, including horned helmets. Another Austrian example is Amestigon, which on the cover of its promotional album Remembering Ancient Origins depicts a wood carved scene of Sigurd killing Regin, an image taken from a panel held in Hylestad stave church.|$|E
5|$|Topologically, the Pythagorean tiling has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the truncated square tiling by squares and regular octagons. The smaller squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles, as are the squares in the truncated square tiling, while the larger squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small, just as the octagons in the truncated square tiling. However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this {{can be explained by}} saying that the truncated square tiling has dihedral symmetry around the center of each tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it p4 symmetry. It is a chiral pattern, meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to superpose it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to paraphrase}} {{the content of}} the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God {{is the only one that}} is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
