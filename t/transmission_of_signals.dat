5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> from one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells {{have been identified as}} being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of audio communication technology {{in form of}} the telephone, first patented in 1876, created the need to increase the amplitude of electrical signals to extend the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> over increasingly long distances. In telegraphy, this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a relay, so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.|$|E
25|$|Signal Troops is an {{integral}} part of the Armed Forces. Its condition and functioning largely influences efficiency of command, the timeliness of combat equipment and weapons. In its development, the Signal Troops has come a long and difficult process that is inextricably linked with the history of the Armed Forces, the changes in the forms and methods of their use and the improvement of military art. From simple audio and visual means of communication for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> and commands on the battlefield to widely branched multi-channel, advanced automated systems that can provide a link of virtually unlimited range of both stationary and moving objects on the ground, in the water, under the water and in the air, this is the historical path of development and improvement of military communications. Communication on the battlefield is one of the main types of operational support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nervous system}} {{is defined by}} the {{presence}} of a special type of cell—the neuron (sometimes called [...] "neurone" [...] or [...] "nerve cell"). [...] Neurons can be distinguished from other cells in a number of ways, but their most fundamental property is that they communicate with other cells via synapses, which are membrane-to-membrane junctions containing molecular machinery that allows rapid <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals,</b> either electrical or chemical. [...] Many types of neuron possess an axon, a protoplasmic protrusion that can extend to distant parts of the body and make thousands of synaptic contacts. [...] Axons frequently travel through the body in bundles called nerves.|$|E

2500|$|In his PhD thesis, Changeux {{suggested}} that the recognition and <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptors [...] (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis Bray). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle). His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain {{the shape of the}} post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin. In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.|$|E
