5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material.

40|$|A {{method for}} speech {{enhancement}} in a reverberating environment using microphone arrays is presented. It {{is defined in}} the time-domain, based on an acoustic signal model formulated using image sources. The method uses the output of a delay and sum (DAS) beamformer steered towards a source together with the outputs of multiple DAS beamformers steered towards <b>the</b> <b>reflections.</b> <b>The</b> outputs are delayed and added together so that the direct signal and <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> are added coherently. A minimum power/distortionless response (MVDR) -formulation for weighting of <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> is also presented. The method requires that the directions of arrival (DOA) and time differences of arrival (TDOA) for <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> are known. In addition the MVDR formulation requires that <b>the</b> relative <b>reflection</b> strengths are known approximately. Simulations and measurements in a real room show that the method suppresses reverberations, interfering sources, and microphone self noise. The direct signal is not distorted. The method has improved performance compared to the conventional DAS beamformer given that <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> used in <b>the</b> beamformer are strong...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> of solar radiation and <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} discoveries—the space {{weathering}} effects {{and the low}} density—led to a new understanding {{about the relationship between}} S-type asteroids and OC meteorites.

This is a useful method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E
5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
