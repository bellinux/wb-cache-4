5|$|One of the {{earliest}} Sooty bear puppets used by Harry Corbett is on display on the pier. Corbett bought the original Sooty puppet on North Pier for his son, Matthew. When Corbett took <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> on BBC's Talent Night programme, he marked the nose and ears with soot {{so that they would}} show up on the black and white television, giving <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> its name.|$|E
5|$|Snipers from Section 6 {{approach}} the building, intending to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Puppet</b> Master's and Kusanagi's brains {{to cover up}} Project 2501. <b>The</b> <b>Puppet</b> Master's shell is destroyed, but Batou shields Kusanagi's head in time to save her brain. As Section 9 closes in on the site, the snipers retreat.|$|E

5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took {{three months and}} {{half a million dollars}} to construct. While filming the movie, <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> had its own makeup artist. <b>The</b> <b>puppet</b> {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of the}} largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed <b>the</b> <b>puppet,</b> while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.|$|E
5|$|The film's plot {{follows the}} hunt by the public-security agency Section 9 for a mysterious hacker known as <b>the</b> <b>Puppet</b> Master. With the {{assistance}} of her team, Motoko Kusanagi tracks and finds their suspect, only {{to be drawn into}} a complex sequence of political intrigue and a cover-up as to the identity and goals of <b>the</b> <b>Puppet</b> Master. The overarching philosophical themes of the film include self-identity in a technologically advanced world. The music, composed by Kenji Kawai, includes an ancient Japanese language in a wedding song that serves as a key piece of music leading up to the climax of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The Pleasures of the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which the characters in <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> show's realities.|$|E

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> for Marion {{was first}} created, he was {{depicted}} as having stripy fur, but {{looked more like}} a mouse {{in the eyes of the}} crew, so his puppet was changed. Marion's image was based on topless photos of the comic actor James Corden.|$|E

50|$|As the {{clothing}} of <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> wear out or are soiled {{the clothing}} {{is replaced by}} the puppeteers. The process of dressing or redressing <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> by <b>the</b> puppeteers is called koshirae.|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Puppet</b> Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that it makes sense. If the player chooses a word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's {{appearance}} and immobility, complaining that <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> {{had to be}} moved around the set to film different scenes. In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt {{would have been a}} CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> never speaks. He talks about how <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
50|$|A {{stage is}} set up using bamboo stems and woollen blankets. A white semi-transparent cloth is strung across {{and serves as a}} screen on which the images of <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> are projected. <b>The</b> <b>puppets</b> are strung across a rope behind the screen and a bright oil lamp placed behind <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> project their images on to the screen. The puppeteers sit behind the screen and {{manipulate}} <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> based on <b>the</b> scene being played. However, innovation has entered this art with the usage of steel frames for stage, loud speakers to render voices and an arc-lamp instead of the oil lamp.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>puppets</b> of <b>the</b> Osaka {{tradition}} tend to {{be somewhat}} smaller overall, while <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> in <b>the</b> Awaji tradition {{are some of the}} largest as productions in that region {{tend to be}} held outdoors.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the events}} of “Puppet Master: The Demon”, shortly after the attack, Myers is arrested under {{suspicion}} for having caused the murders committed by the Totems. His boss, Jennings, has Myers bailed because he believes he is innocent, and Myers tells Jennings about his experience with Toulon's puppets, all-the-while expecting Jennings not to believe him. However, Jennings is interested in Myers' story, and he organizes a group of thugs {{to break into the}} Bodega Bay Inn and steal <b>the</b> <b>puppets.</b> Myers has a disturbing premonition and decides to return to the hotel with Blade to check on <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> which were left behind when he was taken into custody. Meanwhile, Sutekh activates another Totem, which he proceeds to transfer his soul into. Amid their search for <b>the</b> <b>puppets,</b> Sutekh ambushes Jennings’ thugs at the Bodega Bay Inn, before confronting Myers, who has recently arrived at the hotel, and Toulon's puppets. A battle between Sutekh and <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> ensues, resulting in Sutekh attempting to retreat. However, the spirit of André Toulon, piloting Decapitron, is able to destroy him, inadvertently damaging all of <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> in <b>the</b> process. After the defeat of Sutekh, Myers is cleared of the murder charges, has rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> and is now the guardian of <b>the</b> <b>puppets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pećanac was {{eventually}} denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little {{military aid to}} them. The Germans and <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943, and Pećanac was interned for some time afterwards before being killed in mid-1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|The 2017 revived series {{featured}} new puppet characters, the Jupsters, {{who were}} introduced {{as the family}} of previously established character Jup Jup. The revival also retained a segment introduced in Hi-5 House, entitled The Chatterbox. This segment focuses on the discovery of language through simple words and phrases, and features <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> Chatterbox, who teaches a toy robot named Tinka how to speak.|$|E
5|$|The Foreign Minister's {{interpreter}} is ghost-hacked, {{presumably to}} assassinate VIPs {{in an upcoming}} meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious Puppet Master, Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus. After a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with no clue about <b>the</b> <b>Puppet</b> Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>puppets</b> {{were made}} using {{aluminium}} foil, epoxy putty, polymer clay, foam and magnets (in the feet {{to help them}} stay up). Filming <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> was a long process, taking around a week to make six seconds of film.|$|R
50|$|As Lili is leaving, {{she says}} goodbye to Marco, {{telling him that}} she was living a little girl's dream and she must move forward with her life. Marco tries to take her back, but he is {{impressed}} with her newfound maturity and lets her go. Carrot Top and Horrible Henry appear to Lili, telling her to take them with her. She sees <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> are trembling, and lifts <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> off to discover that <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> have been Paul all along. (In some revised versions, Lili reveals that she always knew that <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> were Paul.) As Paul angrily confesses his love for her, she begins to understand the kindness in him and together, they follow the carnival.|$|R
50|$|An {{experiment}} with infants explored latent learning {{at an early}} age. Three-month-olds were exposed to two different hand <b>puppets</b> simultaneously. <b>The</b> infants were then periodically presented with one of <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> until they reached 6-months of age, at which point a target behavior was demonstrated on <b>the</b> first <b>puppet.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> infants were presented with <b>the</b> alternative <b>puppet</b> and performed <b>the</b> target behavior on that puppet {{at a higher rate}} than the control group which had not seen <b>the</b> two <b>puppets</b> paired. This suggests that the pre-exposed infants had formed an association between <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> without obvious reinforcement.|$|R
5|$|The Gengshi Emperor (r.23–25 AD), a {{descendant}} of Emperor Jing (r.157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> monarch Liu Penzi. Emperor Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the series started {{broadcasting}} on ATV in September 1967, principal photography had been completed for the first 20 episodes. In general, turnaround for completing all <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> shots for each episode was two weeks or 11 working days. It was originally predicted that shooting would be wrapped within eight months, but filming overran until late October due {{to the demands of}} the Thunderbird 6 shoot. While production on the next Supermarionation series, , began in November it was not until early 1968 that the last episodes of Captain Scarlet were edited and completed for broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Fielding drew {{inspiration}} from many literary sources and traditions {{as well as from}} his own life. The structure and plot of The Author's Farce {{are similar to those of}} George Farquhar's Love and a Bottle (1698), in that both plays describe the relationship between an author and his landlady. The plays only deal with the same generalised idea however; the particulars of each are different. Fielding also drew on the Scriblerus Club's use of satire and the humour common to traditional Restoration and Augustan drama. Many of Luckless's situations are similar to those found within various traditional British dramas, including Buckingham's The Rehearsal (1672), a satirical play about staging a play. It is possible that Pope's Dunciad Variorum, published on 13 March 1729, influenced the themes of the play and the plot of <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> show. The Court of Nonsense in <b>the</b> <b>puppet</b> show are related to the Court of Dulness in The Dunciad and the Court of Nonsense in John Dryden's Mac Flecknoe. The Scriblerus Club style of humour as a whole influences The Author's Farce, and it is possible that Fielding borrowed from Gay's Three Hours after Marriage (1717) and The Beggar's Opera (1728). In turn, Fielding's play influenced later Scriblerus Club works, especially Pope's fourth book of his revised Dunciad and possibly Gay's The Rehearsal at Goatham.|$|E
50|$|Singers of chèo (a form {{of opera}} {{originating}} in north Vietnam) sing songs which {{tell the story}} being acted out by <b>the</b> <b>puppets.</b> <b>The</b> musicians and <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> interact during performance; the musicians may yell a word of warning to a puppet in danger or a word of encouragement to a puppet in need.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> boxes <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> {{were packed}} in usually denote {{the time period}} that <b>the</b> <b>puppets</b> were made.
