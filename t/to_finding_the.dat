5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> GCD of two natural numbers a and b is {{to calculate}} all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors {{can be found}} by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E

5|$|A shock came on 6 February, when Bill Shankly's Workington {{earned a}} 2–0 win at Borough Park – {{the only time}} in the season Vale lost by more than one goal. Seven days later Scunthorpe & Lindsey United left Vale Park with a point as the home side came close <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> net on {{numerous}} occasions without success despite one shot from Hayward partially injuring goalkeeper Norman Malan after he struck the ball hard into Malan's jaw. Following this short run of poor form they next recorded a win against York City, securing a 1–0 victory at Bootham Crescent. On 27 February, Chesterfield became the first away side to score at Vale Park since September, as they fought back from a two-goal deficit to win a point. Vale had previously conceded just one goal in 20 home games over an 11-month period, and had last conceded twice in a home league game on 30 August 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep concern in the {{personal}} welfare of all players, which extended <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> location of the nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against {{the leadership of the}} Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E

He investigated this group's claims to Jewish descent in the 1980s. He named the group as Bnei Menashe.|$|E
25|$|Posidonius was {{informed}} in his approach <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> Earth's circumference by Eratosthenes, who {{a century earlier}} used the elevation of the sun at different latitudes {{to arrive at a}} figure of 250,000 stadia, a result which he rounded to 252,000 so that it would be divisible by 60. Both men's figures for the Earth's circumference were uncannily accurate, aided in part in each case by mutually compensating errors in measurement.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{clinical}} trials have shown medications {{to be effective}} for treating ADHD, but the trials usually use exclusion criteria, meaning knowledge of medications for ADHD {{is based on a}} small subset of the typical patients seen in clinical practice. They have not been found to improve school performance and data is lacking on long-term effectiveness and the severity of side effects. This class of medicines is generally regarded as one unit; however, they affect the brain differently. Some investigations are dedicated <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> similarities of children who respond to a specific medicine. The behavioral response to stimulants in children is similar regardless of whether they have ADHD or not.|$|E

25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> right commanders he often complained that many officers {{who would have been}} good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E

500|$|In Method of Fluxions (written 1671, {{published}} 1736), Sir Isaac Newton {{examined the}} transformations between polar coordinates, which {{he referred to}} as the [...] "Seventh Manner; For Spirals", and nine other coordinate systems. In the journal Acta Eruditorum (1691), Jacob Bernoulli used a system with a point on a line, called the pole and polar axis respectively. Coordinates were specified by the distance from the pole and the angle from the polar axis. Bernoulli's work extended <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> radius of curvature of curves expressed in these coordinates.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{interpreted}} as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof {{can be seen as}} a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the [...] "lords of all creation" [...] invoking Jesus' blessing. Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of The Marriage of Figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{composer}} Edmund Rubbra, who studied under {{him in the}} early 1920s, Holst was [...] "a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of Prout and Stainer, but with a miniature score of Petrushka or the then recently published Mass in G minor of Vaughan Williams". He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> solution for himself. [...] "I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest—if I agreed!—that, given such and such a phrase, the following one {{would be better if}} it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon... He frequently took away [...] his abhorrence of unessentials." ...|$|E
500|$|After Samuel L. Jackson {{expressed}} interest in appearing in a Star Wars film, he was approached by casting director Robin Gurland to play Windu. Ray Park, a martial arts champion with experience in gymnastics and sword fighting, was originally {{a member of the}} stunt crew. Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard filmed Park to demonstrate his conception of the lightsaber battles. Lucas and McCallum were so impressed with the test tape that they gave Park the role of Maul. His voice was considered [...] "too squeaky" [...] and was dubbed over in post-production by Peter Serafinowicz. Keira Knightley's parents tried to convince her not to audition, but the teenage actress still sought a role since she was a Star Wars fan. The casting was influenced by Knightley's remarkable similarity to Natalie Portman, with the actress admitting their mothers could not tell each other apart. Knightley was reported to have [...] "cried every single day" [...] due <b>to</b> <b>finding</b> <b>the</b> wardrobe uncomfortable.|$|E
