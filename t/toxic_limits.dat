40|$|Background: Better {{treatment}} {{outcomes in}} cystic fibrosis (CF) {{may be expected}} by changing standard twice daily (BID) tobramycin inhalation with the conventional nebulizer to once daily (OD) inhalation at double the standard BID dose with a controlled-inhalation nebulizer. We aimed to determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of inhaled double-dose tobramycin with the controlled-inhalation AKITA® and conventional PARI-LC® Plus nebulizer in patients with CF. Methods: Randomized, open label, crossover study. Pharmacokinetics were assessed in 10 adult CF patients following inhalation of tobramycin (Bramitob®) at double the recommended BID dose with the AKITA (300 mg fill dose) and PARI-LC Plus (600 mg fill dose). Results: No {{significant differences were found}} in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two nebulizers. Median maximum serum levels were 3. 44 (2. 25 - 5. 49) and 2. 84 (0. 82 - 6. 63) mg/L for AKITA and PARI-LC Plus, respectively. Trough serum levels were very low for both nebulizers: 0. 03 (0. 00 - 0. 09) and 0. 02 (0. 00 - 0. 06) mg/L for AKITA and PARI-LC Plus, respectively. Time to maximum level was comparable: 0. 44 (0. 08 - 0. 96) and 0. 40 (0. 08 - 0. 96) hours for AKITA and PARI-LC Plus, respectively. Serum levels were well below the <b>toxic</b> <b>limit.</b> Inhalations were well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred. Nebulization time was 33 % shorter with the AKITA.

An assay using muntjac fibroblasts {{in conjunction with a}} differential spindle and chromosome stain was developed and evaluated for its ability to detect aneuploidy inducing agents. The effects of the spindle poison colcemid and the human carcinogen diethylstilboestrol were compared with those obtained after treatment of the cells with a number of compounds each believed to impair mitotic spindle function via a different mechanism. Vinblastine and nocodazole were both shown to have colcemid like effects suggesting a common mode of action and potential aneugenic activity. p-Fluorophenylalanine affected the spindle morphology resulting in an accumulation of atypical metaphases but without significant chomosome loss. Hydroquinone induced metaphase arrest and significant spindle damage but at doses very close to the <b>toxic</b> <b>limits</b> for this compound. Lastly, acenaphthene appeared to have no significant effect on mitosis at doses up to toxic levels.

We aimed to determine pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of once daily inhalation of the double recommended tobramycin dose with the AKITA® in patients with CF. Systemic absorption {{can be used as}} surrogate for safety. Methods: In a randomized open-label crossover study, PK of inhaled tobramycin in 10 adult CF patients was assessed following inhalation of the double recommended dose with the AKITA® (300 mg fill dose) and PARI-LC® Plus (600 mg fill dose). Blood samples were drawn until 24 hours after inhalation. Results: No significant differences were found in the maximum and trough serum levels, time to maximum level and area under the curve (0 - 24 hours). Both maximum and trough levels were well below their <b>toxic</b> <b>limits</b> for both nebulizers and for all patients. Both inhalations were well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred.

Nevertheless, at these sites some issues must be solved to assure the long-term establishment of vegetation (e. g. salinity, low fertility, metal(loid) phytotoxicity, etc.) The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of the addition of a municipal solid waste on a mine tailings soil and on the growth and metal(loid) accumulation of a grass plant species (Piptatherum miliaceum). In addition, the effects of intra-specific interactions were evaluated. A pot experiment was performed during 8 months, including two soil treatments: the mine soil and its combination with municipal solid wastes. For each treatment, pots without plants, pots with one plant, and pots with two plants were arranged. The addition of municipal solid wastes improved the soil fertility and plant growth in the mine soil, but also increased the mobile fractions of Zn, Pb, Cd, Mn and Ni. Plants in the amended treatments showed better nutritional status (higher P and K). Stable isotope δ 15 N was associated to the better nutritional status, while δ 13 C and δ 18 O indicated higher photosynthetic efficiency and stomatal conductance in amended treatments. Although the accumulation in leaves of most metal(loid) s decreased with the municipal waste application, the concentrations in both treatments did not exceed <b>toxic</b> <b>limits</b> for fodder.

To best of our knowledge, this study is the second one which compares HCKp and HCKi on the basis of toxicity tests.

Red mud was characterized and its toxicity for plants was measured {{to evaluate the}} soil contamination risks. Red mud radioactivity (e. g., U- 238) is about 10 -fold above soil background and previous assessments revealed that radiation risk is limited to indoor radon. The plant toxicity and trace metal availability was tested with mixtures of this red mud and a local noncontaminated soil up to a 16 % dry weight fraction. Increasing red mud applications increased soil pH to maximally 8. 3 and soil solution EC to 12 dS m(- 1). Shoot yield of barley seedlings was affected by 25 % at 5 % red mud in soil and above. Red mud increased shoot Cu, Cr, Fe, and Ni concentrations; however, none of these exceed <b>toxic</b> <b>limits</b> reported elsewhere. Moreover, NaOH amended reference treatments showed similar yield reductions and similar changes in shoot composition. Foliar diagnostics suggest that Na (> 1 % in affected plants) is the prime cause of growth effects in red mud and in corresponding NaOH amended soils. Shoot Cd and Pb concentrations decreased by increasing applications or were unaffected. Leaching amended soils (3 pore volumes) did not completely remove the Na injury, likely because soil structure was deteriorated.

This study focused on the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead in sediment and water in Rio Baru, Costa Rica, which has not been previously studied. The concentrations in Rio Baru were compared to two controls and the Environmental Protection Agency toxicity limits to determine pollution levels. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was utilized to determine the concentrations of heavy metals in water and sediment samples from Rio Baru, Terciopelo, and Rio Tarcoles. Watershed analysis for Rio Baru was expected to reveal mostly agricultural sources of contaminants. Rio Baru was predicted to have levels of inorganic heavy metals between Rio Tarcoles and Terciopelo, with Tarcoles containing the highest levels. As, Cr, and Ni in Rio Baru were between unpolluted levels in Terciopelo and polluted levels in Rio Tarcoles, but Rio Baru had lower concentrations of Cu and Pb than both Rio Tarcoles and Terciopelo. Analysis of watersheds determined that Rio Baru’s watershed contained intermediate ratios of human development and agricultural sources of pollution. Further comparisons of watershed size with total dissolved sediment levels found a positive linear relationship, indicating a portion of differences in heavy metal concentrations were due to watershed sizes. Concentrations of heavy metals in Rio Baru’s water were below <b>toxic</b> <b>limits</b> for drinking water and placed Rio Baru within “good” sediment levels for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb. As geochemistry and proximity to industrial sources was not accounted for in methodology, further research would be necessary for determination of natural concentrations of heavy metals in Rio Baru...|$|E
40|$|The {{cost for}} {{neutralisation}} {{is the second}} largest cost in a bioleaching operation for which, possibilities to replace generally used lime/limestone was tested. Industrial oxidic by-products generated form Swedish industries were investigated for neutralising capacities by chemical leaching with sulphuric acid at pH 1. 5, which is the optimum pH for bioleaching operations. The by-products used for the study comprised of five different steel slags from ore and scrap based steel making, electric arc furnace (EAF) dust from scrap based steel plant, Mesalime from paper and pulp industry and three different types of ashes from combustion for energy production. All the by-products showed a good neutralising capacity, while {{some of them had}} higher capacities than the reference Ca(OH) 2. Due to the good neutralising potential of the by-products obtained from the chemical leaching, attempts were made to use them as neutralising agent in batch bioleaching of pyrite in stirred tank reactor to determine their neutralising potential, eventual toxic effects on the microorganisms and pyrite oxidation. Pyrite oxidation in all the batch bioleaching was in the range of 69 - 80 %, except the Waste ash experiment which was 59 %. Neutralising capacity was high for all the by-products except Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash compared to slaked lime. No remarkable toxic effects due to the by-products were observed except in the Waste ash experiment, which was probably due to the high content of chloride. To confirm if the chloride in the Waste ash caused any toxic effect on the bioxidation activity, batch bioleaching studies were conducted with Ca(OH) 2 + NaCl as neutralizing agent with a similar chloride concentration profile obtained in the Waste ash experiment. Effect of the chloride on the biooxidation of pyrite by sudden exposure of 2 g/L, 3 g/L, and 4 g/L of chloride in the log phase of the biooxidation of pyrite was investigated. Addition of 2 g/L chloride resulted jarosite precipitation with a lower pyrite recovery than the reference experiment, whereas the addition of 3 g/L chloride temporarily chocked the microorganisms but activity was regained after a short period of adaptation. Population dynamics study conducted on the experiment with 3 g/L chloride showed the variation in the microbial species at different stages of the biooxidation of pyrite. The study with sudden exposure of 4 g/L of chloride was found to be lethal to the microbes. Out of all the by-products used in batch bioleaching studies, Mesalime and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) dust were used as a neutralising agent in continuous biooxidation of refractory gold concentrate. The neutralising capacity of EAF dust was lower, while the Mesalime was similar to the Ca(OH) 2 reference. The arsenopyrite oxidation in the experiments ranged from 85 - 90 %, whereas the pyrite oxidation was 63 - 74 %. In subsequent cyanidation 90 % of the gold was achieved in the bioresidues from Mesalime and Ca(OH) 2, while 85 % of gold was recovered in bioresidue from EAF dust. A probable explanation for the low recovery of gold from the EAF dust experiment could be due to the encapsulation of the part of the gold by high elemental sulphur content present in the EAF dust. Cyanide consumption was relatively high and ranged from 8. 1 - 9. 2 kg/tonne feed after 24 hours of cyanidation. Both Mesalime and EAF dust proved to be feasible options as neutralising agents in bioleaching operations. Studies on the modelling of ferrous iron oxidation by a Leptospirillum ferriphilum-dominated culture was conducted with 9 g/L or 18 g/L ferrous iron in a chemostat. Modelling data suggested that the kinetics and yield parameters changed with the overall solution composition. The apparent Fe 3 + inhibition on specific Fe 2 + utilisation rate was a direct consequence of the declining biomass yield on the Fe 2 + oxidation, when dilution rate was decreased. The maintenance activity contributed up to 90 % of the maximum specific Fe 2 + utilisation rate, which appears close to the critical dilution rate. Determination of the <b>toxic</b> <b>limit</b> of chloride were studied both in batch and chemostat conditions. Batch studies showed a <b>toxic</b> <b>limit</b> at 12 g/L chloride, while chemostat studies showed a <b>toxic</b> <b>limit</b> of 4 g/L. Modelling of the ferrous iron oxidation in chloride environment showed a decrease in maximum specific growth rate and increase in the substrate constant. The biomass concentration decreased with the increase in chloride concentration due to the toxic effect on the microorganisms. The maintenance coefficient decreased by 70 % in the chloride environment. Godkänd; 2009; 20091112 (sekgah); DISPUTATION Ämnesområde: Processmetallurgi/Process Metallurgy Opponent: Professor S.
