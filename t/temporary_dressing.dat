Two were only slightly wounded, but two were evidently dying, and as none of their friends were within reach, Madame Darpent and her daughter were forced to devote themselves to these, though fortunately they had not been brought in till her son had piloted M. d'Aubepine through the crowded streets--poor little Cecile! who had hardly ever set foot on the pavement before. Her Count was in a terrible state, his right leg having been torn off by a cannon-ball below the knee, and he would have bled to death long before reaching home had not Clement Darpent observed his condition and taken him into the house, where Madame had enough of the hereditary surgical skill acquired in the civil wars to check the bleeding, and put a <b>temporary</b> <b>dressing</b> on the wounds until a doctor could be obtained; for, alas! they were only too busy on that dreadful day.|$|E

60|$|Poetry is ever {{accompanied}} with pleasure: all spirits {{on which}} it falls open themselves to receive the wisdom which is mingled with its delight. In the infancy of the world, neither poets themselves nor their auditors are {{fully aware of the}} excellence of poetry: for it acts in a divine and unapprehended manner, beyond and above consciousness; and it is reserved for future generations to contemplate and measure the mighty cause and effect in all the strength and splendour of their union. Even in modern times, no living poet ever arrived at the fullness of his fame; the jury which sits in judgement upon a poet, belonging as he does to all time, must be composed of his peers: it must be impanelled by Time from the selectest of the wise of many generations. A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why. The poems of Homer and his contemporaries were the delight of infant Greece; they were the elements of that social system which is the column upon which all succeeding civilization has reposed. Homer embodied the ideal perfection of his age in human character; nor can we doubt that those who read his verses were awakened to an ambition of becoming like to Achilles, Hector, and Ulysses the truth and beauty of friendship, patriotism, and persevering devotion to an object, were unveiled to the depths in these immortal creations: the sentiments of the auditors must have been refined and enlarged by a sympathy with such great and lovely impersonations, until from admiring they imitated, and from imitation they identified themselves with the objects of their admiration. Nor let it be objected, that these characters are remote from moral perfection, and that they can by no means be considered as edifying patterns for general imitation. Every epoch, under names more or less specious, has deified its peculiar errors; Revenge is the naked idol of the worship of a semi-barbarous age; and Self-deceit is the veiled image of unknown evil, before which luxury and satiety lie prostrate. But a poet considers the vices of his contemporaries as a <b>temporary</b> <b>dress</b> in which his creations must be arrayed, and which cover without concealing the eternal proportions of their beauty. An epic or dramatic personage is understood to wear them around his soul, as he may the ancient armour or the modern uniform around his body; whilst it is easy to conceive a dress more graceful than either. The beauty of the internal nature cannot be so far concealed by its accidental vesture, but that the spirit of its form shall communicate itself to the very disguise, and indicate the shape it hides from {{the manner in which it}} is worn. A majestic form and graceful motions will express themselves through the most barbarous and tasteless costume. Few poets of the highest class have chosen to exhibit the beauty of their conceptions in its naked truth and splendour; and it is doubtful whether the alloy of costume, habit, &c., be not necessary to temper this planetary music for mortal ears.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Open {{injuries}} {{to the face}} involving the external carotid artery are uncommon. These injuries are normally associated with laceration {{of the facial nerve}} because this nerve is more superficial than the external carotid artery. Hence, external carotid artery lesions are usually associated with facial nerve dysfunction. We present an unusual case report in which the patient had an injury to this artery with no facial nerve compromise. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25 -year-old Portuguese man sustained a stab wound injury to his right preauricular region with a broken glass. Immediate profuse bleeding ensued. Provisory tamponade of the wound was achieved at the place of aggression by two off-duty doctors. He was initially transferred to a district hospital, where a large arterial bleeding was observed and a <b>temporary</b> compressive <b>dressing</b> was applied. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital. At admission in the emergency room, he presented a pulsating lesion in the right preauricular region and slight weakness in the territory of the inferior buccal branch of the facial nerve. The physical examination suggested an arterial lesion superficial to the facial nerve. However, in the operating theater, a section of the posterior and lateral flanks of the external carotid artery inside the parotid gland was identified. No lesion of the facial nerve was observed, and the external carotid artery was repaired. To better understand the anatomical rationale of this uncommon clinical case, we dissected the preauricular region of six cadavers previously injected with colored latex solutions in the vascular system. A small triangular space between the two main branches of division of the facial nerve in which the external carotid artery was not covered by the facial nerve was observed bilaterally in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case illustrates that, in a preauricular wound, the external carotid artery can be injured without facial nerve damage. However, no similar description was found in the reviewed literature, which suggests that this must be a very rare occurrence. According to the dissection study performed, {{this is due to the}} existence of a triangular space between the cervicofacial and temporofacial nerve trunks in which the external carotid artery is not covered by the facial nerve or its branches. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Wound healing, {{especially}} chronic wound healing, {{has become}} a major clinical problem all over the world. Among all the treatments for wound healing, wound dressings are the main management approaches for both acute and chronic wounds. However, although significant {{progress has been made in}} the development of modern wound dressings over the past few years, there are still restrictions to stimulating the healing process. As an alternative to existing approaches, tissue engineering approaches with stem cell therapy have been widely studied for wound healing applications and showed promising therapeutic effects. Ideally, the next step is to develop a wound dressing with specific therapeutic functions such as delivering therapeutic agents (e. g. growth factors and/or stem cells) to promote the healing process. The overall goal of this doctoral project was to develop an injectable hydrogel cell delivery system which could easily encapsulate and support adipose-derived stem cells 2 ̆ 7 (ADSCs) growth, proliferation and secretion, with the potential use as a <b>temporary</b> bioactive hydrogel <b>dressing</b> for wound healing applications. To this end, the multifunctional PEG-based hyperbranched copolymers with thermoresponsive behavior and in-situ photo-/chemical cross-linkable properties have been developed via an advanced one-step in-situ deactivation enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (DE-ATRP) method. At room temperature, this copolymer was water-soluble while forming a gel rapidly at body temperature, so that the cells can be easily encapsulated and applied to any wound size, shape or cavity, which is less invasive than other approaches and minimizes patients 2 ̆ 7 discomfort. In addition, a photo-/chemical gelation occurs within a short time to achieve a stable hydrogel with enhanced mechanical properties, supporting cell growth, proliferation and secretion. Furthermore, in combination with extracellular matrix (ECM) biopolymer of hyaluronic acid (HA), the microenvironment of the hydrogel system has been optimized during the project, so that the encapsulated ADSCs can maintain their viability and secretion level in vitro. Finally, the in vivo cell survival, material inflammatory response, and the wound healing effect of the optimized hydrogel system with rat ADSCs were evaluated using a rat dorsal excisional wound model. It was found that this system prevented the wound contraction and significantly enhanced angiogenesis. This is the first study to describe an injectable stem cell bioactive hydrogel dressing for wound healing purpose; and with the advanced multifunctional polymer and injectable hydrogel template developed in this project, there is significant potential for further development of this technique to the next step towards the realization of clinical wound healing applications ultimately. 2017 - 07 - 3...|$|R

40|$|Skin allografts {{have been}} used in medical {{practice}} for over a century owing to their unique composition as a biological dressing. Skin allografts can be obtained in several preparations such as cryopreserved, glycerol-preserved, and fresh allograft. A glycerol-preserved allograft (GPA) was introduced in the early 1980 s. It has several advantages compared with other dressings such as ease of processing, storage and transport, lower cost, less antigenicity, antimicrobial properties, and neo-vascularisation promoting properties. Skin allografts are mainly used in the management of severe burn injuries, chronic ulcers, and complex, traumatic wounds. Published reports of the use of skin allografts in association with free flap surgery are few or non existent. We would like to share our experience of several cases of free tissue transfer that utilised GPA as a temporary wound dressing in multiple scenarios.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of calcium hydroxide come from its dissociation into calcium and hydroxyl ions. The action of these ions on tissues and bacteria explains {{the biological and}} antimicrobial properties of this substance. Under the conditions of this retrospective of literature, based on scientific evidences, {{it is possible to}} state that: 1. Dentin is considered the best pulpal protective, and calcium hydroxide has proved, through numerous studies, its capability of inducing the formation of a mineralized bridge over pulpal tissue. 2. It is necessary, whenever possible, to provide time for calcium hydroxide paste to manifest its potential of action on the microorganisms present in endodontic infections. The maintenance of a high concentration of hydroxyl ions can change bacteria enzymatic activity and promote its inactivation. 3. The site of action of hydroxyl ions of calcium hydroxide includes the enzymes in the cytoplasmic membrane. This medication has a large scope of action, and therefore is effective {{on a wide range of}} microorganisms, regardless their metabolic capability. In microbial world, cytoplasmic membranes are similar, irrespective from microorganisms morphological, tinctorial and respiratory characteristics, which means that this medication has a similar effect on aerobic, anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 4.

40|$|Abstract: Managing {{patients}} with open abdomen post-operatively {{has become a}} daily procedure in intensive care units as it reduces mortality rates in {{patients with}} abdominal hypertension, abdominal compartment syndrome and abdominal sepsis. The routine nursing care is more challenging because these nurses should constantly observe the open abdomen which is only covered with a <b>temporary</b> <b>dressing.</b> The researcher has observed that nurses prefer not to nurse patients with open abdomen as they fear that the abdominal contents will protrude. The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore and describe the experiences of professional nurses taking care of patients with open abdomen in intensive care in an academic hospital in Gauteng and to describe the recommendations for assisting professional nurses in taking care of patients with open abdomen. The research design used was a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual design. The target population was professional nurses with more than one year experience caring for patients with open abdomen and are working in a specific adult intensive care unit. Four focus group interviews were conducted and each comprised of six participants. The research question which was addressed was: What are the experiences of the professional nurses caring for patients with open abdomen in intensive care unit? What recommendations can be made for assisting professional nurses in taking care of patients with open abdomen in intensive care unit? Data saturation was reached on the fourth interview. Data were analysed using Tesch‟s method. Three themes also emerged: difficulty in nursing care, complications suffered by patients and poor hospital administration. Recommendations for assisting professional nurses in taking care of patients with open abdomen were then described from the findings of four focus group interviews. Ethical principles and measures of trustworthiness were adhered to throughout the research study. This study revealed that professional nurses in intensive care unit have difficulties in caring for patients with open abdomen due to lack of protocols, lack of equipment, lack of knowledge and skill by the nurses and doctors. This lead to patients developing complications such as infections and fistulas while nurses develop psychological problems. In-service programs and debriefing sessions should be conducted to assist professional nurses in caring for patients with open abdomen. M. Cur...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to evaluate, by {{scanning}} electron microscopy, the effectiveness of 17 % EDTA on removal of canal wall smear layer and calcium hydroxide dressing in different thirds of root canal. METHODS: Ttwenty-four premolars were instrumented in the cervical and middle thirds using Gates-Glidden drills. At the working length, the canal was widened up to # 35 file, followed by scaling up to file # 50. After instrumentation, the teeth were divided into four groups according to the treatment received: GI - irrigation performed with 5 ml of NaOCl 2. 5 %; GII - irrigation with 5 ml of 17 % EDTA for 2 and a half minutes, submitted to agitation with file # 15, followed by irrigation with 5 ml of 2. 5 % NaOCl; GIII - irrigation with 5 ml of NaOCl 2. 5 %, drying, application of <b>temporary</b> <b>dressing</b> of Ca (OH) 2 with propylene glycol and sealing. After 5 days, removing the sealing irrigation with 5 ml of 17 % EDTA for 2 and a half minutes, submitted to agitation with file # 15, followed by a final flush with 5 ml of 2. 5 % NaOCl; GIV - irrigation with 5 ml of 17 % EDTA for 2 and a half minutes, submitted to agitation with file # 15, followed by irrigation with 5 ml of 2. 5 % NaOCl, drying and after use of the medication in Ca (OH) 2 with the sealing and propylene glycol which was removed after 5 days performing the irrigation with 5 ml of 17 % EDTA for 2 and a half minutes, submitted to agitation with file # 15, followed by using 5 ml 2. 5 % NaOCl. Next, the teeth were prepared and taken to the scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The images revealed: Group I - a marked presence of smear layer in all three thirds, Group II - removal of almost all of the smear layer in the cervical third and removal of large quantity in the middle third, whereas in the apical third a large quantity of smear layer still remained however, in comparison with the other groups, this was shown to be cleaner; Group III - in the three thirds, the presence of smear layer was observed, which was shown to be much less compacted than that observed in Group 1; Group IV- in all the thirds there was reduction of smear layer and Ca(OH) 2 -based medication, and presence of several unobstructed dentinal tubules could be observed, demonstrating the second best result observed. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that the use of 17 % EDTA favored removal of the smear layer and intracanal medication residues in all thirds of the root canal...|$|E
40|$|Material products, {{no matter}} how grandiose or technologically advanced, are {{invariably}} subject to physical decay. This exhibition explores sites of urban transformation, development and decline to consider how we navigate and repurpose the future ruins of our urban surroundings. Increasingly produced and experienced outside the gallery, art often {{takes the form of}} interventions in public spaces to create critical responses and insights into urban change. These practices explore how the urban environment is produced by everyday acts and how the city is constructed from material and immaterial structures of civic organisation, representation, power and control. Hard Engineering addresses this broad range of issues with critical cartographies that explore how we think about navigating the city. These take the form of maps, charts and urban guides that assess how counter-narratives, contested histories and overlooked memories can be revived and redeployed within a range of urban contexts undergoing rapid transformation. The exhibition at Museu Nacional De Historia Natural e da Ciencia includes six visual and text guides to Lisbon that are the result of new collaborations across disciplines (Art, Architecture, Civic Engineering, Physical and Human Geography and Social Anthropology). The guides set out to reimagine the contemporary urban environment by exploring overlooked livelihoods, traces of profound social mutation, and the scars of past natural disasters (earthquakes, climate change), economic crisis (industrial decline, poverty) and human conflict (the aftermath of war, migration). They address sites whose relation to the past is now unclear, focusing on fragments of architecture and municipal ruins to suggest possible future models of use. The film installation, situated in the main riding hall, extends these themes and approaches with a series of short films made by each of the artists involved in the city guides. The films are projected onto a large tarpaulin sheet, the ubiquitous <b>temporary</b> <b>dressing</b> of any city that is undergoing ‘regeneration’. This installation offers short movingOimage episodes of transformation and decline, thoughts and propositions for identifying and navigating the future ruins of the city. Included in the exhibition are a series of readings from the publication TEGEL: Speculations and Propositions. In 2012, Tegel airport in Berlin became the point of speculation for a group twentysix artists and writers, who were invited to consider the geometry of Meinhard von Gerkan’s 1964 design, reflect {{on the history of the}} building and imagine its future following its proposed decommissioning after the construction of nearby Brandenburg International Airport. The seven readings explore the material, political and imaginary future of the airport through short stories, infrastructural critique and Sci-Fi narratives – a future further complicated by the fact that it continues to operate long after the construction of Brandenburg, originally intended to replace it...|$|E
