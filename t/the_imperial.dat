5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan, was always occupied by a member of <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> family. He oversaw <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated {{at the beginning of each}} year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> family, the Minister of <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan.|$|E

5|$|Mochitsura Hashimoto {{was born}} in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine {{children}} and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Japanese Naval Academy. The family {{did not have a}} naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and he felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Japanese Army. Hashimoto {{graduated from high school in}} 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving home for the first time, Hashimoto then attended <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics.

5|$|On 13 October 1930, {{representatives of}} the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, the Belgian War Graves Commission and <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission met in Brussels to discuss the status of mixed British-German cemeteries in Belgium. In particular, they met to discuss the status of cemeteries {{established}} by Germans during the war {{where the majority of}} those buried in the cemetery were German. This meeting was brought about because <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission had begun altering the layout of cemeteries containing a high percentage concentration of German dead and began replacing the existing headstones on the Commonwealth graves with the standardized Imperial War Graves Commission headstones, all without first consulting with the German Burial Service in Belgium. The German delegation hoped to retain the established design character of the cemeteries but were ultimately unsuccessful. Control for the cemetery was immediately passed to <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission and further German contribution was limited to providing headstones for a number of graves that were lacking markers. Now that <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission was in full control of the cemetery they immediately set about redesigning it, assigning the task to Assistant Architect William Harrison Cowlishaw. In 1933 Fritz Schult, Chief of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin to request that <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission be approached to take control over other split British-German cemeteries such as those at Marcinelle New Communal Cemetery and Hautrage Military Cemetery. <b>The</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission was maintaining the German graves at St. Symphorien at no cost to Germany and Schult believed it favorable to transfer management of other cemeteries if <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> War Graves Commission would assume all maintenance costs for those cemeteries as well.|$|E
