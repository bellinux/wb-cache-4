40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs,</b> {{focusing}} on direct taxes in the Czech Republic. First, I have chosen those <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> that have a social element. The thesis {{deals with the}}ir evolution and their comparison with other countries. Furthermore, the thesis examines the <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> in more detail {{in terms of their}} objectives, utilization, and efficiency conditions. This is achieved with using various tax load indicators and effective taxation, comparing costs and additionally also the views of experts. Generally, however, this issue lacks a comprehensive study and analysis, and thus also the particular data. <b>Tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> along with social benefits constitute a redistribution system. Their costs and impacts are different. At the beginning of the writing of this thesis, I thought that the tax system should primarily be transparent, simple, focusing on its primary fiscal function and should therefore be free of social politics. I have, however, changed my opinion, because it has turned out that the social tax elements have their positive specifics that are difficult and expensive to transport to the system of direct benefits...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} succession planning in family businesses in Ireland with a particular focus on the tax implications. The importance of succession planning is stressed and the taxes triggered and <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> relevant to succession are outlined. A survey of family businesses {{was carried out in}} order to investigate the perceived importance of succession planning and to gather data on whether family businesses in Ireland are cognisant of both the tax implications and the <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> that are available if particular conditions are fulfilled. Results indicate that while the owners of family businesses do believe that succession planning is critically important, few have a succession plan in place. Most owners were not aware of the tax implications of succession (beyond having an impression that taxes definitely were triggered), suggesting that valuable <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> available on succession may be lost as a result of failure to meet eligibility criteria...|$|R
5|$|The {{prominence}} of a Brahmin in Indian society was {{directly related to}} his virtues, values, knowledge and practice of the scriptures. Manu's list of virtues of a perfect Brahmin, according to Italian Jesuit Roberto de Nobili, in order of importance were righteousness, truthfulness, generosity, almsgiving, compassion, self-restraint and diligent work. Prior {{to the rise of}} the Konkanastha Peshwas, the Konkanastha Brahmins were considered inferior in a society where the Deshasthas held socio-economic, ritual and Brahminical superiority. As mentioned earlier, all the Pant Pradhan during Shivaji's rule were Deshastha Brahmins and many modern families who have surname, Peshwe, are in fact Deshastha Brahmins tracing descent to Shivaji's Pant Pradhans, Moropant Pingle or Sonopant Dabir. After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa, Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune, where the Peshwa offered some important offices to the Konkanastha caste. The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> and grants of land. Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to optimize the application of deduction of tax loss taking into account other tax deductions and <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs.</b> The first two parts are based primarily on Act No. 586 / 1992 Coll., on income taxes. They define the conditions {{for the application of}} the deduction of the tax loss, of the expenses (costs) from tax base by the realization of research and development programs, of the donation and of the <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs.</b> The third and last chapter applies these knowledges at the optimalization of the application of deduction of tax loss. The optimization is performed for two fictitious tax payers of the corporate income tax. The intention is to find the optimal combination of deductions and <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs,</b> when the taxpayer minimizes tax liability after taking into account the possibility of the additional tax assessment {{as a result of the}} tax audit. A procedure that reduces the disadvantage of inability to use the tax deduction against an additional increase in tax during the tax audit is set at the end of this thesis...|$|R

As a result it is argued that the alternative proposals lead to unequally distributed <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> between different income groups and generate weaker investment incentives.
