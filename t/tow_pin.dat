Located on site, but not owned by Allied, is Osborne Propellers.|$|E
50|$|The tow-ball {{is popular}} for lighter loads, readily {{allowing}} swivelling and articulation of a trailer. A <b>tow</b> <b>pin</b> and jaw with a trailer loop {{are often used}} for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows the same movements. A pintle and lunette is a very heavy duty hitching combination used in construction and the military.|$|E
50|$|A {{tow hitch}} (or tow bar) is a device {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a <b>tow</b> <b>pin,</b> or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|E

40|$|IMO No 9550905 Serious injury Vessel {{was between}} two {{legs of a}} 3 leg mooring system, 1 anchor to the Starboard side and 1 anchor to the port side. The end of the Starboard 76 mm chain was held by the tow wire and the 10 mm riser chain {{attached}} to the port anchor along with 76 mm chain was being pulled over the stern roller between the <b>tow</b> <b>pins</b> by the tugger winch. As the can buoy came over the roller it lifted the 10 mm riser chain above the <b>tow</b> <b>pins</b> and lashed out to the port side of the vessel striking the IP on the left leg and left elbow. IP {{was standing on the}} work deck without the protection of the crash rails. Note: For the purpose of subsection 49 (2) of the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (TSI Act) any On-Board Recordings (OBR) relating to a matter that the ATSB has decided not to investigate, as identified in this publication, are not to be treated as OBR on and after the date of publication of this weekly summary. Section 48 of the TSI Act contains a definition of an OBR. The voice component of a Voyage Data Recorder normally meets the requirements of an OBR...|$|R
50|$|A pintle is a pin or bolt, usually {{inserted}} into a gudgeon, {{which is used}} {{as part of a}} pivot or hinge. Other applications include pintle and lunette ring for <b>towing,</b> and pintle <b>pins</b> securing casters in furniture.|$|R
50|$|Conventional tugs use a tow bar {{to connect}} the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The tow bar is fixed {{laterally}} at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the tow bar may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the tow bar acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the towbar also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized <b>tow</b> <b>pin</b> on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The tow bar must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy tow bars for large aircraft the towbar rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a hydraulic jacking mechanism which can lift the towbar to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the tow bar wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The tow bar can be connected at the front or {{the rear of the}} tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The towbar has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the bar from the nose gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug.Towbarless tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground, allowing the tug to maneuver the aircraft. This allows better control of the aircraft and higher speeds; it may also eliminate the need to have a worker in the cockpit to apply the aircraft's brakes. The main advantage of a towbarless tug is simplicity; {{there is no need to}} maintain multiple towbars. The physical action and coordination required by the tug operator to move an aircraft with a TBL tug is simpler and easier to learn than with a tug and towbar. By connecting the tug directly to the aircraft's landing gear tug operators have better control and responsiveness when maneuvering. This is most advantageous in general aviation settings where operators are often required to move more types of aircraft more often into more confined spaces than their airline counterparts.|$|E
