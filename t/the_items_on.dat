One of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E

After some hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. As a condition for Tchaikovsky's engagement, the Russian Musical Society required a list of works {{that he planned to}} conduct.

Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer {{that he may have}} been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live.

25|$|Lack of self-correction: {{scientific}} research programmes make mistakes, but {{they tend to}} reduce these errors over time.

The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of both candidates Hsieh and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in Taipei said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the guts to sign the commitments.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some games}} such as Second Life, in-game {{currency}} is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to {{fall under the}} same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP would rather not place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both {{to the difficulty of}} regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E

30|$|Most {{participants}} reported that the questionnaires were clear and easy to complete. Some minor revisions were made to specific <b>items</b> based <b>on</b> participant feedback. For example, participants had difficulty with the initial wording of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>on</b> injection pain (originally phrased as “the injections are painful”) and offered suggestions for revisions. This item was re-worded twice during the cognitive interview phase. All participants completing {{the final version of}} <b>the</b> <b>item</b> (“How often do you experience pain when injecting medication with this device?”) demonstrated that they understood <b>the</b> <b>item</b> as intended without difficulty. <b>The</b> <b>item</b> <b>on</b> difficulty with dose selection (“How difficult is it to select the correct dose for each injection?”) was not applicable to all participants because many non-insulin injection devices do not require patients to select a dose. The phrasing of this item was revised to ask about frequency to allow participants to answer <b>the</b> <b>item</b> even if their device does not require dose selection (“How often do you have difficulty selecting the correct dose with your injection device?”). Feedback from participants suggested that <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>on</b> disposal of <b>the</b> device and its parts was confusing because it assessed two constructs. Therefore this item was split into separate questions asking about disposal of the injection device (“How difficult is it to dispose of the injection device?”) and disposal of the device parts (“How difficult is it to dispose of materials associated with the injection device, such as the cap and needle?”). Two items were added based on recommendations from participants. These additional items assessed anxiety and difficulty keeping the injection device and medication at the correct temperature when it is necessary to inject away from home.|$|R
