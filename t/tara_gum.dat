50|$|T. spinosa pods are an {{excellent}} source of environmentally friendly tannins (tara tannins) most commonly used in the manufacture of automotive and furniture leathers. This growing industry is developing around their production in Peru. Some producers have their own plantations to guarantee constant quality. Tara tannin derivatives are being proposed as antifouling against marine organisms that can grow on ship hulls. Those tannins are of the hydrolysable type. Gallic acid is the main constituent of tara tannins (53%) and can be easily isolated by alkaline hydrolysis of the plant extract. Quinic acid is also a constituent of the tara tannins. Its tannines are colourless or light making them suitable a pre-mordant in the dyeing of cotton and other cellulose fibres.Tara gum is a white or beige, nearly odorless powder that is produced by separating and grinding the endosperm of T. spinosa seeds. <b>Tara</b> <b>gum</b> consists of a linear main chain of (1-4)-β-D-mannopyranose units attached by (1-6) linkages with α-D-galactopyranose units. The major component of the gum is a galactomannan polymer similar to the main components of guar and locust bean gums that are used widely in the food industry. The ratio of mannose to galactose in <b>tara</b> <b>gum</b> is 3:1. <b>Tara</b> <b>gum</b> has been deemed safe for human consumption as a food additive.Tara gum is used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in a number of food applications. A solution of <b>tara</b> <b>gum</b> is less viscous than a guar gum solution of the same concentration, but more viscous than a solution of locust bean gum. Generally, <b>tara</b> <b>gum</b> presents a viscosity around 5,500 cps (1% aqueous solution). Furthermore, <b>tara</b> <b>gum</b> shows an intermediate acid stability between locust bean gum and guar gum. It resists the depolymerisation effect of organic acids down to a pH of 3.5. This gum is also stable to high-temperature treatment, up to 145 °C in a continuous process plant. Blends of tara with modified and unmodified starches can be produced which have enhanced stabilization and emulsification properties, and these are used in the preparation of convenience foods, such as ice cream.|$|E

40|$|Prosopis laevigata and Opuntia ficus-indica grow in arid and {{semiarid}} {{regions of}} Mexico and other countries. Both produce biopolymers with interesting characteristics from the rheological {{point of view}} as well as because of their coagulating-flocculating capabilities. Prosopis produce galactomannans inside the endosperm, {{very similar to those}} found in guar, locust bean, and <b>tara</b> <b>gums.</b> Opuntia sp. produces mucilage that contains polygalacturonic acid and five neutral sugars. Prosopis seed gum has not been proposed to be used as coagulant-flocculant before. In the case of Opuntia mucilage, some authors have suggested its use in the treatment of waters, using either the mucilage or the whole cladode powder. The use of these products in the treatment of municipal or even industrial wastewaters could give rise to diverse benefits. From the environmental point of view, treated waters with neither Fe nor Al, nor synthetic polymers would be obtained (with less toxicity risk). Besides, the produced sludges would be smaller in amount, with better biodegradability, and lower metals content. From the economical point of view, the use of these biopolymers would give an added value to the Opuntia and Prosopis culture in Mexico, helping small communities to enhance their incomes by producing environmental-friendly products. This work shows that both Prosopis galactomannan and Opuntia mucilage can be used to treat municipal wastewaters with an initial organic charge of about 827 mg/L as COD by the coagulation-flocculation process, with COD removals for the mesquite seed gum of up to 90 % (pH 10, dose of 75 mg/L) and of 60 % (pH 7, doses of 50 and 150 mg/L). In the case of mucilage, 65 % of the initial COD was removed at pH 10 (dose of 50 mg/L). These figures are very promising for the treatment of wastewaters, with environmental-friendly products...|$|R

Sugar concentrations > 40 wt% decreased cosolubility. Based on the mannose:galactose ratio of GM and type of sugar (added in concentration 15 wt%) the best cosolubility and corresponding smallest σ was attributed to FG and trehalose, respectively.

They exhibited strong differences {{with respect to}} their molecular weight and their fine chemical structure. It could also be noticed that the different locust bean gum samples differed significatively with this respect from each other. The rheological behavior of the mixtures of these galactomannans with Kappa-carrageenan (k-car), with and without addition of KC 1, the total polymer concentration being kept constant at 1 g/dL, has been investigated. The viscoelastic properties of the mixed gels with <b>tara</b> <b>gum</b> and locust bean gum showed a synergistic maximum at the 4 : 1 k-car/galactomannan ratio. The location of this maximum did not depend upon the KC 1 content. Guar gum was the only galactomannan which did not exhibit synergism upon mixing with k-car. The extent of the synergism, as extimated from the storage modulus at the maximum (G'max), was linearly related to the product (M/G) " 2 (#eta#). This relation means that the synergism is ruled not only by the smooth regions of the mannan backbone of the galactomannan but also by its molecular weight. Two types of sol-gel phase diagrams of the mixed system k-car/locust bean gum were estabilished: a) In the sol-gel phase diagram of the mixed system k-car/locust bean gum at the 4 : 1 ratio, relating the total potassium concentration in the mixed system with the gelation and melting temperatures, a sharp sol-gel transition was evidenced {{as a function of the}} temperature. The differences between the melting temperature of the blend and that of k-car alone could be described to the increase of gel rigidity which was itself induced by the presence of the galactomannan. b) In the sol-gel phase diagram, relating the total polymer concentration of the blend to the k-car/locust bean gum ratio, it was also confirmed a sharp sol-gel transition for the k-car/locust bean gum blend.

40|$|Agricultural {{processing}} inevitably {{goes along}} with the production of large amounts of agro-residues, which may represent a major waste disposal problem. Legislation regulating the management of waste materials has appeared throughout the European Union and has significantly contributed {{to the introduction of}} sustainable waste management procedures. The reuse and recycling of agro-residues has been highly encouraged and new technologies applying environmentally clean processes have been playing a central role within this context. These strategies may boost both the environmental and economic profiles of the implied industries, since they may create value in the entire chain-production pipeline. Typically, a substantial part of the agro-residues produced during the handling and processing of fruits, vegetables and forest resources still comprises important amounts of the original plant materials, such as fruit skins, fruit seeds, flowers, leaves, stems, barks, and roots. High-value natural compounds can be found in most of these vegetable residues, many of them having health-promoting characteristics. It is the case of, for example, phenolic compounds (which have been associated to the alleged health-promoting effects related to the consumption of fruits and vegetables), since they are preferentially biosynthesised in the external vegetable tissues. Usually, and despite their significant potential value, these residues are often underexploited and thus their potential value as natural products is frequently lost. Efficient techniques can thus be explored for separation and isolation of oils, antioxidants, fragrances, colorants, biocides and other bioactive substances of natural origin. Therefore, with some additional and adequate processing steps, these materials can be easily transformed, from a residual low-value status into a very interesting high-value status, in terms of well-known and consumer high-value and accepted uses in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, among others. This Thesis is focused on the extraction of potentially valuable compounds from agroresidues of elder and maritime pine (Portuguese native plants) and also from tara (a Peruvian native plant). Solvents and techniques generally regarded as “environmental friendly” were applied. Despite conventional methods such as hydrodistillation and Soxhlet extraction had been employed, special attention was given to high pressure extraction procedures, namely supercritical and pressurized solvent extractions using, respectively, carbon dioxide and mixtures of carbon dioxide, ethanol and water as solvents. In general terms and besides other particular aspects, the effect of several process variables/conditions on the yields and on the characteristics of the obtained extracts, such as composition and antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities, was analyzed. Extract fractionation, solvent flow rate and composition, in addition to extraction time, temperature and pressure, were among these studied process variables/conditions. Characterization of extracts involved the use of diverse analytical techniques including spectrophotometric and chromatographic ones. Elderberry pomace and elderflower were evaluated as sources of potentially useful natural compounds. Elderberry pomace is a juice-processing industry residue which comprises the fruit skins and seeds, and is known to be rich in anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds. It was subjected to high pressure extractions at 313 K and ~ 20 MPa, applying supercritical carbon dioxide in a first step and pressurized solvent mixtures of carbon dioxide, ethanol and water in a second step. Extract fractionation was achieved by such a methodology. While the first step led to extracts rich in lipids and other apolar substances, obtained second step extracts revealed high contents of anthocyanins and presented high antioxidant activities, which were strongly influenced by the employed solvent mixture composition. The results of this study highlight the potential of elderberry pomace as a source of valuable compounds, and may assist in the development of strategies for integral exploitation of elderberries, reducing the environmental impact of elderberry juice processing industries. Elderflower was, in its turn, subjected to supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The effect of solvent density (300 - 900 kg/m 3) and of extraction temperature (308 - 328 K) on extracts characteristics was analyzed. Most of the obtained extracts revealed high contents of apolar compounds. Their phenolic compounds contents and the resulting antioxidant activities were relatively low, but they may possibly be increased if ethanol and water mixtures are added as cosolvents to carbon dioxide (which is planned to be performed in the near future). Nevertheless, obtained results revealed that elderflower extracts achieved by supercritical fluid technology may be added as natural aromatic additives to cosmetic and food systems. Maritime pine bark is an abundant residue from pine wood processing industries which is rich in condensed tannins. This residue was subjected to conventional solid-liquid aqueousbased extractions as well as to supercritical and pressurized solvent extraction procedures in order to obtain efficient vegetable tanning agents and bioactive phenolic-based extracts, respectively. Conventional aqueous extractions were optimized by adding small amounts (up to 15 %, v/v) of ethanol. This methodology was selective for condensed tannins and the obtained extracts revealed adequate characteristics for leather tanning applications. Concerning supercritical fluid extraction experiments, carbon dioxide and a mixture of carbon dioxide and ethanol (10 %) were used in two consecutive steps, varying extraction pressure in the range 10 - 30 MPa, and extraction temperature in the range 303 - 323 K. The employed fractionated extraction methodology showed {{that it was possible to}} obtain different extract fractions having diverse antioxidant activities from maritime pine bark. Moreover, it showed that the process could be further optimized through the usage of different solvent mixtures as well as other operational conditions. Therefore, pressurized solvent extractions were consecutively performed varying some process variables such as solvent mixture composition (carbon dioxide and ethanol, with up to 90 % of ethanol) and flow rate. Extraction kinetics and extracts composition (in terms of phenolic compounds in general, and of condensed tannins in particular) were considerably affected by the solvent mixture composition. The results of these studies showed that both conventional and high pressure extraction methodologies may be feasible strategies for the valorization of maritime pine bark, therefore reducing the environmental impact and increasing the profit of the involved industries. Finally, tara seed coat, which is a residue of tara powder and of <b>tara</b> <b>gum</b> processing industries, was evaluated as a source of phenolic compounds in general, and of hydrolysable tannins, in particular. Pressurized solvent extractions using homogeneous solvent mixtures of carbon dioxide, ethanol and water were performed at 313 K and 20 MPa. An experimental mixture design was applied in order to optimize the solvent mixture composition in terms of selectivity towards the above referred compounds, as well as in terms of antioxidant activities and lipoxygenase inhibition activities (indicative of their anti-inflammatory capacities) of the whole extracts. The achieved mixture models permitted to discern the contribution of the three individual solvents used: while water revealed to be the most effective solvent to obtain high extraction yields, ethanol-rich mixtures originated the maximum extracts´ phenolic contents. Moreover, the obtained extracts presented quite relevant antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibition activities. Tara seed coat is, therefore, a rich source of bioactive compounds, which may be applied as natural additives in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical goods, increasing their shelf-lives and/or acting as human health promoters. In conclusion, instead of being disposed as waste of environmental concern or utilized in low value applications, agro-residues of elder, maritime pine and tara are promising sources of important constituents and should be considered for valorization. Environmentally clean methodologies and solvents may be applied for the extraction of natural colorants, flavors, aromas, preservatives, among others, some of them presenting bioactive properties. The choice of the appropriate extraction methodology and extraction conditions is of extreme importance for the selectivity of the extraction towards the intended compounds and for the resulting properties of the obtained natural extracts, defining their future potential applications. The successful exploitation of the studied agro-residues still requires further research and development, besides the one presented in this Thesis. A more precise identification of the natural compounds present in the obtained extracts is still required and will be addressed in future works. Moreover, other issues like the toxicity, metabolism, bioavailability and physiological activities of the extracted compounds also need to be considered. Nevertheless, a contribution has been given to the sustainability of elder, maritime pine and tara processing industries. O processamento industrial de produtos agrícolas e florestais origina enormes quantidades de resíduos que podem constituir um sério problema ambiental, se forem sujeitos a procedimentos incorrectos de aproveitamento e/ou eliminação. Frequentemente, estes resíduos são apenas parcialmente valorizados, sendo utilizados para alimentação animal, como fertilizantes ou transformados em biocombustível. Contudo, nos últimos anos tem-se verificado uma tendência crescente para a sua valorização, acompanhando a evolução de uma legislação ambiental cada vez mais restritiva. Neste contexto, a reutilização e reciclagem destes resíduos naturais têm sido encorajadas, contribuindo para agregar valor económico na linha de produção das empresas do sector, podendo mesmo constituir uma excelente oportunidade de negócio. Tipicamente, uma parte substancial dos resíduos produzidos durante o processamento de frutos, vegetais e recursos florestais consiste da matéria-prima original, incluindo a pele e as sementes dos frutos, flores, folhas, caules, casca de árvores e raízes. Na maior parte destes resíduos existem quantidades substanciais de compostos com elevado valor acrescentado, muitos deles possuindo propriedades benéficas para a saúde humana. De entre eles, destacamse os compostos fenólicos (que têm sido associados aos benefícios relacionados com o consumo de frutos e vegetais), uma vez que são preferencialmente sintetizados nos tecidos vegetais exteriores. Usualmente, e apesar do seu valor significativo, estes resíduos são comummente sub-explorados, e o seu potencial valor como produto natural é frequentemente perdido. Sendo assim, uma das áreas com maior potencial de exploração é o aproveitamento de substâncias com elevado valor acrescentado. De facto, após o tratamento adequado das matérias-primas, seguido de técnicas de separação adequadas, a maior parte dos resíduos agro-industriais pode constituir uma fonte rica de antioxidantes, corantes, fragrâncias e biocidas naturais, entre outros, com enorme interesse para as indústrias farmacêutica, cosmética ou alimentar. Neste trabalho foi estudada a extracção de compostos com potencial valor acrescentado a partir de resíduos de três plantas: o sabugueiro e o pinheiro-bravo (nativas de Portugal), e a tara (nativa do Peru). Foram usadas técnicas e solventes de extracção considerados “amigos do ambiente”. Apesar de terem sido usadas técnicas convencionais de extracção, como a hidrodestilação e a extracção por Soxhlet, foi dado especial destaque à extracção supercrítica e à extracção com solvente pressurizado, usando como solventes, respectivamente, o dióxido de carbono supercrítico e misturas pressurizadas de dióxido de carbono, etanol e água. Em termos gerais, e para além de outros aspectos particulares, foi estudado o efeito de diversas variáveis/condições de processo (fraccionamento de extracção, composição do solvente, temperatura e pressão de operação, caudal de solvente, entre outros) nos rendimentos e nas características dos extractos obtidos, nomeadamente em termos de composição e actividades antioxidante e anti-inflamatória. Para a caracterização analítica dos extractos foram usadas diversas técnicas analíticas, incluindo espectrofotométricas e cromatográficas. O bagaço e a flor de sabugueiro foram avaliados como possíveis fontes de compostos naturais de interesse. O bagaço de sabugueiro, um resíduo proveniente da indústria de processamento de sumo, é constituído essencialmente pelas peles e grainhas das bagas e é uma fonte rica de antocianinas e outros compostos fenólicos. Este resíduo foi sujeito a extracção a alta pressão a 313 K e a ~ 20 MPa, usando dióxido de carbono supercrítico numa primeira etapa, e misturas pressurizadas de dióxido de carbono, etanol e água numa segunda etapa. Esta metodologia de extracção permitiu obter o fraccionamento do extracto. A primeira etapa de extracção originou extractos contendo elevados teores de lípidos e outras substâncias apolares. Os extractos obtidos na segunda etapa revelaram ter elevados teores de antocianinas e apresentaram uma elevada actividade antioxidante, com uma acentuada influência da composição do solvente. Os resultados deste estudo evidenciaram o potencial do bagaço do sabugueiro como fonte de compostos com elevado valor acrescentado, podendo contribuir para o desenvolvimento de estratégias de utilização integral das bagas, reduzindo o impacto ambiental das indústrias do sector. Por outro lado, a flor foi sujeita a extracção supercrítica usando dióxido de carbono como solvente. Foi avaliado o efeito da massa específica do solvente (300 - 900 kg/m 3) e da temperatura de extracção (308 - 328 K) nos rendimentos e nas características dos extractos obtidos. A maior parte dos extractos obtidos revelaram ter um elevado teor de compostos apolares. No entanto, os seus teores de compostos fenólicos e as suas actividades antioxidantes foram relativamente baixos, podendo eventualmente ser melhorados se misturas de etanol e água forem usadas como co-solventes (o que se prevê que venha a ser feito em trabalhos futuros). Os resultados obtidos revelaram que os extractos de flor de sabugueiro obtidos recorrendo à tecnologia de extracção supercrítica podem, eventualmente, ser usados como aditivos aromáticos naturais em produtos alimentares e cosméticos. A casca do pinheiro-bravo, um resíduo abundante da indústria madeireira e rico em taninos condensados, foi sujeita a extracções convencionais (com o objectivo de obter extractos eficazes na curtimenta de peles de animais) e a extracções supercríticas e com solvente pressurizado (com o objectivo de obter extractos bioactivos). Nas extracções convencionais, foi utilizada água como solvente e foi optimizado o aditivo usado. Verificouse que uma pequena percentagem de etanol (até 15 %, v/v) foi selectiva para os taninos condensados e que os extractos obtidos tinham condições adequadas para serem usados na curtimenta de pele de animais. Nas extracções supercríticas foram estudadas as condições de pressão (10 - 30 MPa) e temperatura (303 - 323 K), usando o dióxido de carbono e uma mistura de dióxido de carbono e etanol (10 %) como solventes, em dois passos consecutivos. A metodologia de extracção aplicada mostrou que é possível obter fracções de extracto com actividades diversas a partir da casca de pinheiro-bravo. Para além disso, mostrou que o processo podia, ainda, ser optimizado utilizando diferentes condições experimentais, entre as quais a composição do solvente. Sendo assim, foram efectuadas extracções com solvente pressurizado variando algumas condições de processo, tais como a composição do solvente (misturas de dióxido de carbono e etanol, contendo até 90 % de etanol) e o caudal de solvente. Tanto as cinéticas de extracção como a composição dos extractos (em termos de compostos fenólicos, em geral, e de taninos condensados, em particular) foram consideravelmente afectados pela composição da mistura do solvente. Este estudo mostrou que, tanto a metodologia de extracção convencional como a de alta pressão, podem ser estratégias viáveis de valorização da casca do pinheiro-bravo, contribuindo para a redução do impacto ambiental e para o aumento do lucro das indústrias do sector. Finalmente, foi avaliada a possibilidade de aproveitamento da casca da semente de tara (um resíduo proveniente do processamento do fruto para a obtenção de pó e goma de tara) para a recuperação de compostos fenólicos, em geral, e de taninos hidrolisáveis, em particular. Foram efectuadas extracções pressurizadas usando misturas homogéneas de dióxido de carbono, etanol e água, a 313 K e a 20 MPa. Foi utilizado um desenho experimental para optimizar a composição do solvente de extracção, em termos de selectividade para com os compostos referidos, assim como em termos de actividade antioxidante e de inibição da lipoxigenase (indicativa da actividade anti-inflamatória). Os modelos de mistura obtidos permitiram avaliar a contribuição de cada um dos solventes individuais usados: enquanto que a água foi eficaz na promoção de elevados rendimentos de extracção, o etanol foi selectivo para os compostos fenólicos. Os extractos obtidos mostraram ter um elevado teor de compostos fenólicos e apresentaram relevantes actividades antioxidante e anti-inflamatória. Sendo assim, a casca da semente de tara é uma fonte rica de compostos bioactivos que podem ser usados como aditivos naturais em produtos alimentares, cosméticos e farmacêuticos, aumentando a sua vida útil e/ou actuando como substâncias promotoras da saúde humana. Em conclusão, os resíduos obtidos a partir de sabugueiro, pinheiro-bravo e tara são fontes promissoras de substâncias importantes devendo, por isso, ser considerados para valorização, em vez de serem encarados como causadores de problemas ambientais, ou serem usados em aplicações de baixo valor acrescentado. Neste estudo foram aplicadas metodologias e solventes “amigos do ambiente” para a extracção de corantes, aromas e antioxidantes, entre outros, de origem natural, alguns deles apresentando potenciais propriedades biológicas. A escolha da metodologia adequada e das condições particulares de extracção é de extrema importância para a selectividade da extracção para com os compostos de interesse, assim como para as propriedades evidenciadas pelos extractos naturais obtidos, definindo as suas potenciais aplicações futuras. O sucesso da exploração dos resíduos agro-industriais considerados requer mais investigação e desenvolvimento, para além dos apresentados neste estudo. Nomeadamente, requer uma identificação mais precisa dos compostos naturais presentes nos extractos obtidos, que irá ser abordada em trabalhos futuros. Outras questões tais como o metabolismo, a bio-disponibilidade e a actividade fisiológica dos compostos presentes nos extractos também necessitam, eventualmente, de ser considerados. No entanto, neste estudo foi dada uma contribuição para a sustentabilidade das indústrias de processamento de sabugueiro, pinheiro-bravo e tara.
