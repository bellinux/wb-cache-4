40|$|Abstract. A {{stochastic}} model for type III bursts is introduced, discussed, and compared to observations. The active region {{is assumed to}} be inhomogeneous, with a large number of emerging magnetic fibers. At their bases, random energy release events take place, in the course of which electrons are accelerated, travel along the fibers and eventually undergo the bump-ontail instability. In the non-linear regime, the formed Langmuir waves induce strong turbulence in the ambient plasma, with secondary electrostatic waves appearing. Wave-wave scattering finally leads to the emission of <b>transverse</b> <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>waves</b> at the fundamental and the harmonic of the local plasmafrequency. The superposition of the emissions from all the fibers yields a model spectrogram for type III bursts (flux as a function of frequency and time). Peak-flux distributions of the model are compared to th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solar and interplanetary type III (TIII) radio bursts are {{produced}} by solar electron beams of flare origin streaming away in the interplanetary medium. The radio emission process implies the excitation of Langmuir waves by the electron beam which are converted by non linear processes into <b>transverse</b> <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>waves.</b> The study of the beam properties reveals information about their propagation regime in the interplanetary medium. The local plasma condition observed {{in the vicinity of}} the radio emission zone are important in understanding the Langmuir waves excitation process and their conversion into electromagnetic radiation as well as the propagation of the electron beams. Interplanetary TIII have therefore long been studied for either of theses aspects but only for few isolated cases could the three aspects of such events be studied together.

In particular we show how {{to determine a}} collective variable associated with the internal 3 -center of mass on the instantaneous 3 -spaces, to be eliminated with the constraints K⃗_(int) ≈ 0. Here K⃗_(int) is the Lorentz boost generator in the unfaithful internal realization of the Poincare' group and its vanishing is the gauge fixing to the rest-frame conditions P⃗_(int) ≈ 0. We show how to find this collective variable for the following isolated systems: a) charged particles with a Coulomb plus Darwin mutual interaction; b) transverse radiation field; c) charged particles with a mutual Coulomb interaction plus a <b>transverse</b> <b>electro-magnetic</b> field. Then we define the Dixon multipolar expansion for the open particle subsystem.

It is shown that Einstein's comprehensive relativity and denial of an absolute frame of reference for the universe are incorrect and that the universe has an absolute universal prime frame of reference.
