6000|$|He {{walked slowly}} along, absorbed in his thoughts, {{unconscious}} {{even of the}} direction in which his footsteps were taking him. When at last he paused, he was outside a theatre. The name of Ibsen occupied a prominent place upon the boards. From somewhere among the hidden cells of his memory came a glimmering recollection--a word or two read at random, an impression, only half understood, yet the germ of which had survived. Ibsen! A prophet of truth, surely! He looked eagerly down the placard for the announcements and <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission.</b> And then a sudden cold douche of memory descended upon his new enthusiasms. There was Ellen! ...|$|R
500|$|The Xbox {{version of}} Doom 3 {{received}} a similar level of critical support, holding {{a score of}} 88 percent on Metacritic and an 87.7 percent score on GameRankings. The game was praised and faulted {{on many of the}} same issues as the PC version, although the game was praised for maintaining smooth and user-friendly controls on a gamepad, as well as for including a two player co-operative multiplayer mode, which IGN described as [...] "worth <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> alone." [...] However, some criticism was directed towards slow-downs in play due to the game engine, despite being scaled down for the Xbox, still being demanding on the Xbox hardware.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, This Is It {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly, praised the album {{and gave it}} an overall rating of a B+. Vozick-Levinson described the album's track [...] "This Is It" [...] as being an [...] "uplifting ballad" [...] and felt that [...] "if you're feeling generous" [...] you can [...] "count the minimally distinguishable" [...] orchestra version of [...] "This Is It" [...] having {{thought of it as}} being a [...] "decent if slight addition to Jackson's songbook." [...] Vozick-Levinson stated that while the album's second disc only contains four tracks that were unreleased, that included a [...] "fairly unremarkable" [...] spoken-word poem, after hearing Jackson [...] "work out the vocal harmonies" [...] for [...] "Beat It," [...] he in particular, felt that This Is It was [...] "well worth <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> (or at least a healthy chunk of it)." [...] Brian Linder of IGN described This Is It as a [...] "freshly designed" [...] release of a greatest hits album, and that the album's tracks of an all-vocal arrangement of [...] "Beat It" [...] was [...] "particularly awesome" [...] and the acoustic version of [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] allows Jackson's [...] "vocals to shine without the distraction of dated '70s musical underpinnings." [...] Linder did note that he felt that the album was both a [...] "fitting tribute" [...] to Jackson and a [...] "crass, commercial double-dip." ...|$|E

50|$|On {{the death}} of William Powell King bought his share in the King Street Theatre. There during the summer seasons of 1770 and 1771 he was actor and sole manager. He then sold his share to James William Dodd, and {{purchased}} from builder 75% of Sadler's Wells, {{in which he was}} associated with Samuel Arnold. He made some changes in the performances, raised <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> and provided horse patrols, to guard through a dangerous district the fashionable visitors whom he attracted. His <b>prices</b> entitled <b>the</b> visitor to receive a pint of wine at an added cost of sixpence. In 1778 King sold his share, and was succeeded by Richard Wroughton.|$|R
5000|$|Praise {{came for}} Laurence Olivier's cameo as the Duke of Wellington, with Philip French of The Times writing that [...] "...

60|$|Although the fête was {{especially}} {{on behalf of}} a charity, no admission fees were charged to guests, but everyone understood that it would be his duty to lay out money at the various picturesque tents scattered about under the trees. In these were all the most popular entertainers of the day. In one pavilion John Parry gave a short entertainment every half-hour. In a larger one Mario, Grisi, Jenny Lind, and Alboni gave short concerts, and high as were <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> there was never a seat vacant. Conjurers had a tent, electro-biologists--then the latest rage from the United States--held their séances, and at some distance from the others Richardson's booth was in full swing. The Grenadiers' band and a string band played alternately.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Paul Mavis said [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom is all-new, {{and therein lies}} what has [...] {{increasingly}} routine: haphazard quality.

40|$|The {{market for}} ski runs or {{amusement}} rides often features lump-sum admission tickets with no explicit price per ride. Therefore, {{the equation of}} the demand for rides to the supply involves queues, which are systematically longer during peak periods, such as weekends. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> tickets are much less responsive than the length of queues to variations in demand, even when these variations are predictable. We show that this method <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> generates nearly efficient outcomes under plausible conditions. In particular, the existence of queues and <b>the</b> "stickiness" <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> do {{not necessarily mean that}} rides are allocated improperly or that firms choose inefficient levels of investment. We then draw an analogy between "ski-lift pricing" and the use of profit-sharing schemes in the labor market. Although firms face explicit marginal costs of labor that are sticky and less than workers' reservation wages, and although the pool of profits seems to create a common-property problem for workers, this method <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> can approximate <b>the</b> competitive outcomes for employment and total labor compensation. ...|$|R
50|$|The Collector's Room was {{the only}} way to access the Gallery's {{expansive}} balcony. Guests could sit up in the Balcony and people watch as long as they want. In the evening, the Gallery Balcony was used as a hard-ticket seating area for the Fantasmic! river show. The seats included an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet with unlimited soft drinks and coffee. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> was very steep and usually coincides with <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> Park <b>admission.</b>|$|R
50|$|Approximately 60,000 people {{visited the}} park on Disneyland's opening day, July 17, 1955, when park {{admission}} was priced at $1.00 for adults and 50 cents for children. This did not include access to rides and other individual attractions; attraction tickets could be purchased separately for 10 to 35 cents.

50|$|Paying {{just one}} shekel plays a social {{statement}} regarding <b>the</b> high <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> to other cultural events around the country, which prevent many {{from going to}} and enjoying them. The symbolic admission fee ensures that the association's events are accessible by anyone, no matter their socio-economic status. The moral that the association aims to promote is that every person {{has the right to}} attend cultural events, and that culture should not be a luxury, rather it should be a right.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, many {{movie theater}} chains sell {{discounted}} passes, {{which can be}} exchanged for tickets to regular showings. These passes are traditionally sold in bulk to institutional customers and also {{to the general public}} at Bulktix.com.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} this trial, however, the {{directors}} of the railway treated the 'new-fangled' invention with indifference, and requested its removal. In July 1839, however, it was favoured by the Great Western Railway, and a line erected from the Paddington station terminus to West Drayton railway station, a distance of thirteen miles (21km). Part of the wire was laid underground at first, but subsequently all of it was raised on posts along the line. Their circuit was eventually extended to [...] in 1841, and was publicly exhibited at Paddington as a marvel of science, which could transmit fifty signals a distance of 280,000 miles per minute (7,500km/s). <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> was a shilling (£0.05), and in 1844 one fascinated observer recorded the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Opened in November 2005, {{the indoor}} resort {{features}} an 85-metre-high indoor mountain with 5 slopes of varying steepness and difficulty, including a 400-metre-long run, the world's first indoor black diamond run, and various features (boxes, rails, kickers) that are changed {{on a regular}} basis. A quad lift and a tow lift carry skiers and snowboarders up the mountain. [...] Adjoining the slopes is a 3,000-square-metre Snow Park play area comprising sled and toboggan runs, an icy body slide, climbing towers, giant snowballs and an ice cave.

2500|$|While {{the direct}} {{exchange}} of campaign contributions for contracts {{is the most}} visible form of pay to play, the greater concern is {{the central role of}} money in politics, and its skewing both the composition and the policies of government. Thus, those who can pay <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> such as to a $1000/plate dinner or $25,000 [...] "breakout session", gain access to power and/or its spoils, to the exclusion of those who cannot or will not pay: [...] "giving certain people advantages that other don't have because they donated to your campaign". Good-government advocates consider this an outrage because [...] "political fundraising should have no relationship to policy recommendations".

5000|$|The undercard, or {{preliminary}} matches (sometimes preliminary card), {{consists of}} preliminary bouts that occur before the headline or [...] "main event" [...] {{of a particular}} boxing, professional wrestling, horse racing, auto racing, or other sports event. (In auto racing, however, the term [...] "support race" [...] occurs more commonly.) Typically, promoters intend the undercard to provide fans {{with an opportunity to}} see up-and-coming fighters or fighters not so well known and popular as their counterparts in the main event. The undercard also ensures that if the main event ends quickly fans will still feel that they received sufficient value for <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> their <b>admission.</b>|$|R
25|$|While she {{was dancing}} at the Hyperion Theater at Yale University, in November 1911, {{students}} rushed the stage.

The performance followed the Yale - Princeton University football game played earlier the same day. <b>The</b> inflated <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> {{is thought to}} have triggered the students to pull the seats to pieces and proceed with the outbreak. Deslys retreated to her room while stage hands used fire extinguishers to subdue the students. The same month Deslys performed at the Winter Garden Theater in a production of Vera Violetta. In 1913 Deslys appeared with Al Jolson (in blackface) in the musical comedy The Honeymoon Express.|$|R
