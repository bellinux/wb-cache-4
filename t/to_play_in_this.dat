5|$|While {{playing for}} the local youth team of San Vendemiano, Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper, {{in order to gain}} more playing time. His mother thought {{it would be better for}} him <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role as he would not sweat, and the {{possibility}} of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, Alessandro was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and Del Piero switched to a forward role.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E
5|$|The main mode {{of play in}} the Guitar Hero {{games is}} Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional {{performance}} arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across {{the rest of the}} game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue in which they wish <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked.

25|$|Within the {{framework}} of the post-Classic cycle of thirteen katuns (the so-called 'Short Count'), some of the Yucatec Books of Chilam Balam present a deluge myth describing the collapse of the sky, the subsequent flood, and the re-establishment of the world and its five world trees upon the cycle's conclusion and resumption. The lightning deity (Bolon Dzacab), the divine carriers of sky and earth (the Bacabs), and the earth crocodile (Itzam Cab Ain) all have a role <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> cosmic drama, to which a much earlier, hieroglyphic text from Palenque's Temple XIX seems to allude. The Quichean Popol Vuh does not mention the collapse of the sky and the establishment of the five trees, but focuses instead on a succession of previous mankinds, the last of which was destroyed by a flood.|$|E

25|$|The AAGPBL {{operated}} from 1943 to 1954 {{and gave}} over 600 women athletes {{the opportunity to}} play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained. The league was conceived by Philip K. Wrigley during World War II. Wrigley, who was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, conceived the idea of initiating the innovative project to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. By sending out talent scouts and setting up try-outs in dozens of major cities, Wrigley attracted hundreds of women from all over the United States and Canada who were eager <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> new professional league. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. League play officially began on May 30, 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team was made up of fifteen girls.|$|E

Local papers reported that Heikkinen’s line play during high school was marked by hard tackling and blocking. During his junior season in 1934, Coach Reihsen recalled Heikkinen played every minute of every game. Coach Reihnsen's team {{was known as the}} “Speed Boys,” and gave up only two points in the first four games, outscoring opponents, 652. In November 1934, Coach Reihsen took Heikkinen to Minneapolis to attend his first Big Ten football game, the Little Brown Jug match between Michigan and Minnesota. Reihsen recalled that, after the game, Heikkinen said: “Some day I’m going <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> stadium.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E
