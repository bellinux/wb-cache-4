5|$|American {{football}} {{has been}} played outside the US since the 1920s and accelerated in popularity after World War II, especially {{in countries with}} large numbers of U.S. military personnel, who often formed a substantial proportion of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> spectators.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Goldsmith {{wrote the}} {{score for the}} film. The music was {{recorded}} at Rome's Forum Studio in July 1980, and was fraught with difficulties — the studio was not large enough for his orchestra, and room noise made by <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> their equipment affected the tracks.|$|E
50|$|Four {{different}} formations (the {{different ways}} <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> partner can assist <b>the</b> <b>player)</b> can be selected during the battle: Wind formation (partner mimics {{the actions of}} <b>the</b> <b>player),</b> Forest formation (<b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> partner are always targeted on different opponents), Mountain formation (partner stays between <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> opponent and blocks enemy attacks) or Fire formation (both <b>player</b> <b>and</b> partner focus on the same opponent and attack continuously). The Fire and Mountain formations also increase the strength <b>and</b> defense of <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> partner, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The game {{begins with}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> his {{childhood}} friend Jowy Atreides working together {{as members of}} the youth division of the Highland Army. Luca Blight, the prince of Highland, <b>and</b> Captain Rowd, <b>the</b> <b>player’s</b> commanding officer, orchestrate the slaughter of <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> <b>and</b> Jowy's unit and blame it on the neighboring city-state of Jowston, giving the prince an excuse to invade Jowston. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> Jowy escape <b>the</b> slaughter by jumping off a cliff into a river.|$|R
50|$|After {{difficulty}} {{entering into}} Muse {{due to increased}} security, the party finally reunite with Viktor {{and members of the}} mercenary army that survived the attack. Viktor introduces <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> Jowy to Lady Annabelle—the mayor of Muse—who tells them she has a story to share regarding the adoptive grandfather/father figure of <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> Nanami, Genkaku, who died shortly before the game begins. Without the knowledge of <b>the</b> others, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> Jowy are asked to participate in a spy mission to the Highland camp to the north, and while trying to escape, Jowy is captured by the enemy. He promises to catch up with <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> Nanami, however, and eventually reunites with them in Muse.|$|R
5|$|On December 10, 2006, Fischer telephoned an Icelandic {{television}} station {{and pointed out}} a winning combination, missed by <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> commentators. In 2005, some of Fischer's belongings were auctioned on eBay. Fischer claimed, in 2006, that those belongings were worth millions of U.S. dollars.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-five-move rule: Similar to the fifty-move rule; however, if {{the final}} {{move in the}} {{sequence}} resulted in checkmate, this takes precedence. As with the fivefold-repetition rule, this applies independently of claims by <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> allows a tournament director to intervene. This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E
5|$|Snyder's response, {{and that}} of other fans, {{reflects}} the psychology of identification with sports teams. Self-esteem becomes bound to <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> the team, with many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.|$|E

50|$|When {{the last}} stone falls {{in an empty}} pit in <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> row <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} pit in the opponent's row contains exactly two stones, those are captured by <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> removed from <b>the</b> game. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> also gets another turn.|$|R

5|$|The {{budget for}} the Olympiad was 13.3 million EUR. Some 6.8 million EUR were {{set aside for the}} {{first-class}} accommodation for <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> delegates, while another 1 million EUR goes to the FIDE Commission for World Championships & Olympiads and intellectual rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black {{players on the}} Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show up}} for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a continuation of a boycott of spring practice by <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases the discrimination was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure that all students, regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the ABC's {{documentary}} The Chappell Era, broadcast in 2002, encapsulated Chappell's significance to Australian cricket. Subtitled Cricket in the '70s, it chronicled {{the rise of the}} Australian cricket team under Chappell, the fight for better pay for <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> professionalisation of the game through WSC. During the program, Chappell reiterated his criticisms of cricket's administration at the time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} {{developed over the}} timing of the decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for <b>the</b> <b>Players</b> <b>and</b> his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s the FA Cup final was {{the only}} {{football}} match to be televised nationally, resulting in heightened media attention for <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> clubs involved. The Players' Union successfully requested an additional £5 per man for appearing in a televised match, the first time such appearance money had been paid. Birmingham's players signed an exclusive contract with the BBC committing them to appear only on BBC programmes in {{the weeks leading up}} to the final, though their post-match celebration would be covered live by the regional commercial station ATV. The match itself attracted a television audience of fivemillion, a high figure for the period.|$|E

5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, the club's NHL {{franchise}} {{was transferred}} to St. Louis, although the Association continued its ownership of the franchise and player contracts {{as well as the}} senior club. On October 15, 1935, the NHL bought back the franchise and players' contracts for $40,000 and suspended its operations again. Under the agreement, the NHL paid for <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> took back possession of the franchise. If the franchise was resold, the proceeds would go to the Ottawa Hockey Association.|$|E
5|$|In {{a replay}} of the 2007 World Cup final, the German team drew 0–0 with Brazil in the opening game at the 2008 Summer Olympics. They then beat both Nigeria and North Korea {{to advance to the}} quarter-final, where they {{defeated}} Sweden 2–0 after extra time. In the semi-final, Germany again met Brazil. Birgit Prinz scored in the 10th minute, but the German team lost 1–4 after conceding three goals to Brazilian counter-attacks in the second half. They beat Japan 2–0 for the bronze medal, with Fatmire Bajramaj scoring both goals. The third consecutive semi-final loss at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment by both <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>and</b> the German press. The team's overall performance and head coach Silvia Neid were harshly criticised in the media.|$|E
