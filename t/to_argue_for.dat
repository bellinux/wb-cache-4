5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} {{the law was}} fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception.

5|$|The {{case was}} called before the Supreme Court on March 17, 1862. Attorney General Edward Bates {{announced}} that he was delegating the argument to U.S. Attorney Keasbey. Jackalow's attorney was not present, and, by letter, requested a postponement. No postponement was forthcoming, and Reverdy Johnson volunteered <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> Jackalow.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Seychellum {{are the two}} species of Deckenia from the African mainland.

25|$|Much of {{the writing}} was {{therefore}} anonymous; or in manuscript form; or (in the case of Catholic arguments) smuggled into the country. Some was published in Scotland. Leicester's Commonwealth (1584), for example, an illegally circulated tract attacking the queen's favourite Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, devoted much of its space <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> Mary Queen of Scots' succession rights.|$|R

5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E
5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E
5|$|Euan MacKie has {{supported}} Thom's analysis, {{to which he}} added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed {{that this was a}} foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at Maes Howe and on the Bush Barrow Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{from within}} the Trotskyist {{tradition}} have sometimes argued that the Socialist Party misunderstands Trotsky's Transitional Programme. Since 'transitional demands' are an attempt to link today's struggles with the struggle <b>for</b> socialism, critics <b>argue</b> that Trotsky's transitional demand regarding the need for strike committees should be raised, and that the Socialist Party should <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> these strike committees {{to take control of}} the workplaces. They argue that this is preferable <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> nationalisation since nationalisation does not show how workers would reach workers' control of the workplaces.|$|R

5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E

25|$|The early feminist {{movement}} began <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> {{the improvement of}} women's education in the 1860s: Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon met through their activism at the Society for the Employment of Women and the Englishwoman's Review.

40|$|This paper {{claims that}} the {{standard}} characterization of the motivational role of belief should be supplemented. Beliefs do not only, jointly with desires, cause and rationalize actions that will satisfy the desires, if the beliefs are true; beliefs are also the practical ground of other cognitive attitudes, like imagining, which means beliefs determine whether and when one acts with those other attitudes as the cognitive inputs into choices and practical reasoning. In addition <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> this thesis, I take issue with Velleman's argument that belief and imagining cannot be distinguished {{on the basis of}} motivational role...|$|R

25|$|Dreyfus's seminal {{critique}} of cognitivism (or the computational {{account of the}} mind), What Computers Can't Do, consciously replays Merleau-Ponty's {{critique of}} intellectualist psychology <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> the irreducibility of corporeal know-how to discrete, syntactic processes. Through the influence of Dreyfus's critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>for</b> religious {{equality in}} India, Gandhi's ideology {{called for the}} equality of humankind, a secularly spiritual demand based on peace and kindness {{for the betterment of}} all. He believed that Indian National Spirituality would allow the East to be an example to the West in promoting national communities tied by belief. Gandhi saw the endemic oppression of the Dalit or untouchable population by the caste system of Hinduism as a heinous institution. He promoted embracing the Dalit population as also being Harijan or children of God, and the British programs implemented to raise Dalit status through educational and employment opportunity programs.|$|R
