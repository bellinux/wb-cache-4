50|$|In January 2013, Salopek {{embarked}} on a seven-year walk along one of the routes taken by early humans to migrate out of Africa. The transcontinental foot journey will cover more than 20,000 miles, beginning in Africa, in Ethiopia, across the Middle East and through Asia, via Alaska and down {{the western edge of}} the Americas to the southern tip of Chile. The project, entitled Out of Eden Walk, is funded by National Geographic Magazine, the Knight Foundation and the Abundance Foundation. The project is designed as a laboratory of slow journalism that engages with <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> our time—from climate change to technological innovation, from mass migration to cultural survival—by walking alongside the populations who inhabit such headlines every day. The object is to immerse readers in the lives of people encountered en route: the nomads, villagers, traders, farmers, and fishermen who rarely make the news. When the seven-year trek ends, the walk will have generated a global mosaic <b>of</b> <b>stories,</b> faces, sounds, and landscapes highlighting the pathways that connect us to each other—a mostly digital archive of our shared humanity at the start of a new millennium.|$|R
