5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit.

5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{started in}} 1924, with <b>the</b> <b>line</b> opening in 1940. It allowed the {{district}} of Sogn access to Bergen and Oslo via the Bergen Line. Electric traction was taken into use in 1944; at first El 9 locomotives were used, and from 1982 El 11. Until 1991, the train connected with a ferry service from Flåm to Gudvangen. In 1992, freight services were terminated, and due to low ticket prices and high operating costs, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was nearly closed. In 1998, Flåm Utvikling took over marketing and ticket sale for <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> prices were heavily increased and El 17 locomotives were introduced.

5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines at the end of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Because of this continuous change there are certain points on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them.
