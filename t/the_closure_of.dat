40|$|<b>The</b> first-order <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> a class F of {{formulas}} is {{the smallest}} superclass of F that is closed under firstorder quantification.

40|$|We study {{algebraic}} closure and {{its relation}} with definable closure in free groups and more generally in torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Given a torsion-free hyperbolic group G and a nonabelian subgroup A of G, we describe G as a constructible group from <b>the</b> algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> A along cyclic subgroups. In particular, it follows that <b>the</b> algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> A is finitely generated, quasiconvex and hyperbolic. Suppose that G is free.
