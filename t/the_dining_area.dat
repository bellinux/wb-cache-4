5|$|Serendipity 3 was a 1950s style diner, {{featuring}} burgers, {{fries and}} ice cream delicacies. Portions were extremely large. The ice cream parlor themed restaurant, which was {{a branch of the}} New York City Serendipity 3 establishment, opened in 2009. In addition to seating in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> and counter seating, there was a patio with views of the Strip and the Caesars Palace fountains. Besides its giant hamburger, the restaurant was known for its Triple Decker Grilled Cheese sandwich and a The Hangover omelet made with bacon, cheese, French fries, and mushrooms. Ice cream sundaes featured a choice of toppings including butterscotch sauce, chocolate sauce, hot fudge, marshmallow sauce, Oreo kisses, peanut butter sauce, rainbow sprinkles, raspberry sauce, etc. Other options included Fried Twinkies, brownies, and the Golden Opulence sundae, an indulgent $1,000 US sundae, which holds the Guinness World Record for the Most Expensive Ice Cream Sundae in the World. It closed on January 2, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E
5|$|To {{help get}} the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters {{listed as a}} landmark, RMJM Hillier and Rohm and Haas focused renovations on opening up floor space and modernizing systems. A part of the {{original}} plan that altered the building's facade was abandoned, but the facade received a thorough cleaning. Inside, most of the enclosed office space was removed and replaced with open workstations. The new layout was also designed to let more light into the interior of the building. The work spaces also received new furniture, which replaced some that dated back to the 1960s. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> was moved from the basement to street level in a space that was previously occupied by a bank, but had lain vacant for several years. Security, telecommunications, and central plant systems were also upgraded and modernized. The interior renovations finished around May 2008, with improvements to the surrounding plaza completed several months later.|$|E
50|$|There were sparkling, outstandingly {{beautiful}} chandeliers in {{each room}} {{and in the}} hallways as well. In addition, a local artisan produced wall sconces that provided additional lighting to all of <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> rooms on both levels of the restaurant. All of the rooms in the house had deep-set (due to the thick stone walls), casement windows. They were (and still are) outstanding and their sills offered great locations for floral arrangements and candlelight in all of <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>the</b> bar. In order to access <b>the</b> upper <b>dining</b> <b>areas,</b> there was a main, curving staircase. This staircase had an amazing, ornate mural (painted by Peter Langlois and Dana Wardrop http://www.applieddesigns.ca/about.htm) painted on the curved wall that led visitors to the equally stunning second storey.|$|R

25|$|Purcell and Elmslie {{designed}} select {{pieces of}} furniture for the house, including a small, triangular-backed chair, dubbed a “surprise point” chair by William Purcell, for use in Edna’s writing nook. Several noteworthy built-in furnishings include a combined bench and radiator cover beneath the front living room windows; a desk in the writing nook; and a combined bed, writing desk, bookcase, and storage area in the children’s room, which Purcell designed after the Pullman-style bed of a train’s sleeping car. Purcell brought furniture from his previous home {{for use in the}} dining space, and folding chairs were stored in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> for impromptu visitors.|$|E
25|$|Though open-plan, the first-level {{interior}} of the Purcell–Cutts House features individual room areas by virtue of alterations in floor level and breadth of floor space, while the tented ceiling maintains the same height throughout. The ground floor living room area {{at the front of}} the house features a high ceiling, increasing available space for the repeated pairs of art glass windows that comprise the walls of the front of the living room, while <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> behind, set a half-story above, has a low ceiling. The pointed prow separating the dining and living areas creates a small nook, reserved as Edna Purcell’s writing area. The effect of the main level’s design is to maintain intimacy within the larger space, not rendering adjacent spaces automatically visible in main areas of the house, while preserving unity between rooms and the openness of the entire floor.|$|E

The cafe's manager said that Euell had not been rude to Shay. Two waiters denied that Euell had lunged at Shay. A cashier testified that when Shay asked for sugar, Euell pointed out that there was already some on his table, but he brought two more bowls. She said that Shay called Euell [...] "smarty" [...] and confronted Euell with the gun while the waiter was walking away. Shay denied being drunk and said that Euell hit him and threatened to kill him before the shooting.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{economic}} hardships {{caused by the}} Great Depression, the Pine Tavern was a success, especially popular with local timber workers and their families.

In 1957, a major renovation expanded <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area,</b> incorporating the two giant pine trees into a new dining room.

[...] Cappelletti implored, to which DeStefano replied [...] "Then we need to put the fire out" [...] before having his men drag the severely burned Cappelletti into <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> and forcing the man's family to urinate on him in unison.

[...] She also rejected the marble floor in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area,</b> considering it to be ostentatious, but relented as the house was nearing completion.

Behind all its highly elaborated decoration, with European Baroque influence, essentially the structure is Neo-Classic in style, making a unique and yet elegant combination of both styles.

Wooden beams supports a galvanized zinc roof. The windows and doors of the building are wooden with movable louvers and fixed colored glass inlets. A variety of flooring material is used throughout the house: from native cement-colored tiles in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>area</b> and vestibule, 1" [...] by 6" [...] tongue-and-groove wood slats in the living area and bedrooms, and ceramic tiles in the bathroom, to marble tiles at the entry-way.|$|E
