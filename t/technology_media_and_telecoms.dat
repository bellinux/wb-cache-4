5000|$|Utilities have {{traditionally}} been businesses where the customer is the regulator rather than the rate-payer using the service. This has traditionally meant innovation, including {{through the use of}} corporate venturing, has been of lower priority than gaining market share and pricing power unless required by regulatory action. Corporate venturing at utilities, therefore, has historically been more pro-cyclical to the economic than other industry sectors. [...] However, telecom operators in particular, such as Deutsche Telekom's T-Venture and formerly France Telecom's Innovacom, have built up a successful track record through at least one economic cycle and an increasing number of utilities across the electric, gas and phone industries have started to increase their use of external innovation and corporate venturing. Korea Telecom in July 2010 set up a KRW1 trillion (US$830m) corporate venturing fund, the largest announced fund since the <b>technology,</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecoms</b> bubble burst in 2000 and 2001.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine whether discretion {{is used in the}} purchase price allocation decisions in companies listed in OMX Helsinki in 2007. Data: The sample consists of companies listed in OMX Helsinki reporting acquisitions in their 2007 financial statements. Companies operating in the financial services industry are excluded due to their different financial characteristics. Thus, the sample consists of 54 observations. The data is extracted from the financial statements of the sample companies and Bloomberg database. Results: No evidence was found that discretion in the allocation decision is used in order to manage earnings. Instead, a negative association between the size of the acquirer and proportionate allocation to goodwill was documented implying that scarcity of accounting resources or political costs impact the allocation decision. Moreover, evidence was found that companies in <b>technology,</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecom</b> sector allocate proportionately more to other intangible assets than companies operating in other sectors. Also, a positive association between the R&D activity of the acquirer and allocation to intangible assets was documented. These further consolidate the findings implicating that the reported allocations do not deviate from the underlying economics as a result of earnings management. Keywords: Purchase price allocation, IFRS 3, earnings management, mergers and acquisition...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of how {{established}} institutions within the <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecom</b> industries act in times of change, using {{the first decade of}} the 2000 s as its time frame. As an emerging field that has inspired high expectations but also much uncertainty, mobile media has been a leading subject of scholarly investigation. Located mainly within the management of technological innovation tradition, this thesis discusses how incumbent institutions, with their legacies from the traditional <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecom</b> industries, make sense of the mobile device as a media platform, as well as how they translate their perceptions into plans and actions. Furthermore, this thesis connects the development of mobile media to other, more far-reaching developments—technological, cultural <b>and</b> economic—within the <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecom</b> industries. Hence it considers how mobile-media perceptions and facilitations are related to the more general developments of media convergence, changing audience relations and challenging new-media business models. It concentrates on well-established institutions from the Norwegian <b>media</b> <b>and</b> <b>telecom</b> markets—the incumbent telecom operator Telenor, the public service broadcaster NRK, the tabloid newspaper VG, the commercial television channel TV 2 and the commercial radio channel P 4 in particular. This thesis relies upon a multifold definition of the term “strategy” and distinguishes further among strategies as plans, patterns and perspectives. Hence, it analyses not only what these institutions say they plan to do (and what they actually do) regarding mobile media but also the foundation of these decisions—that is, industry perceptions and working notions. The latter term is given particular attention in this thesis, because analyses of strategies as plans or patterns can mislead us into believing that the institution’s decision-making processes are linear and rational and driven by well-documented goals and aims. On the other hand, studies that incorporate working notions - where different working notions compete and where the dominant working notion might even change over time - provide a more chaotic but ultimately more dynamic and realistic representation of reality. This thesis aims to substantiate why, and outline how, this is so...|$|R
