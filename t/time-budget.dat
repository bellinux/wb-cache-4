We experimentally {{examined the}} effect of tail loss on the <b>time-budgets,</b> movement patterns, and home range size of the Iberian rock lizard Lacerta monticola in the field during the mating season. Our results indicate that tail loss did not alter most variables in male and female <b>time-budgets</b> but did affect the time spent moving and movement patterns of males. Tailless males spent less time moving and, when moving, more time on rocks, with shorter movements, more pauses, and less time on bushes than did tailed ones. Home range size was smaller in tailless males but did not differ between tailed and tailless females. The results suggest that tailless males may compensate the survival cost of autotomy by modifying their use of space and time; as a result, however, they may incur lower access to females.

Nest-site {{characteristics}} (10 nests, of 9 pairs) and aerial foraging <b>time-budgets</b> of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster {{were studied}} on the Gold Coast and Tweed Coast (Queensland/NSW border region) of subtropical eastern Australia. White-bellied Sea-Eagle nests were situated high (> 10 m) on lateral branch-forks in tall (> 18 m), living, large-boled trees (> 1. 1 m diameter at breast height), mainly eucalypts in open forest, within ~ 1 km of waterbodies, and between 220 m and 1. 1 km (mean 460 m) from human settlements. From {{the coastal plain}} to the subcoastal foothills up to 8 km inland, nests occurred at elevations up to 75 m above sea-level, but most were at ≤ 5 m asl; nests were on flat land or on slopes, the latter commonly with a southerly aspect. Two focal pairs of Sea-Eagles each spent ~ 15 % of observation time (20 h per pair) in foraging-related searching and commuting flight, and < 1 % of aerial foraging time in attacking prey.

40|$|The {{absence of}} a {{structural}} relationship between trip generation and transportation supply characteristics {{has been seen as}} a major drawback of conventional transportation demand models. We respond to this criticism by developing a model of household activity demand that underlies and generates transportation demand. Time is considered as an argument in an activity utility function that the individual attempts to maximize, subject to a <b>time-budget</b> constraint. Transportation system improvements relax the <b>time-budget</b> constraint, providing opportunities for additional nonhome activities, with a corresponding generation of trips. Trip generation is found to be insensitive to transportation system performance in the short run. However, our model provides a framework in which the impacts of large transportation improvements could be modeled in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|Various {{hypotheses}} about adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms of non-parental infant care {{have been put}} forward for different taxa (Emlen et al., 1991). The Neotropical callitrichid primates are renowned for their cooperative care of the twin litters. None of the studies conducted in the wild included information on genetic relationships within groups. This, however, is indispensable to evaluate the relevance of competing hypotheses concerning direct or indirect fitness gains. We studied two groups of wild moustached tamarins with known genetic relationships over a one-year period to examine individual <b>time-budgets</b> and contributions to infant carrying and food-transfer. With these data we tested whether helping behaviour might be a non-adaptive trait and, if not, whether indirect benefits via kin-selection could be excluded as an evolutionary force maintaining it. Other hypotheses on direct fitness benefits were discussed as far as (anecdotal) data permitted. Changes in <b>time-budgets</b> suggest costs, thus clearly refuting hypotheses assuming non-adaptivity. High within-group relatedness suggests kin-selection to be one driving force of maintaining the trait. However, non-parental individuals may help despite low relatedness. Data were not sufficient to decide which possible direct benefits most likely {{play a role in}} inducing non-relatives to help. Yet, two (non-exclusive) explanations seem to be the most probable ones: The chance to inherit the main-breeding position, and a certain chance of own direct reproductive success (the latter only for male helpers) due to polyandrous mating by the female. Other adaptive mechanisms may enhance benefits but are unlikely to be major selective forces since fitness gains are presumably rather small or uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Time {{constraints}} {{can limit}} an animal's potential {{to survive in}} a given habitat and the maximum size of its group. Many studies have, therefore, investigated the ecological correlates of time allocated to travelling, foraging and vigilance. However, animals spend more time inactive than active, and understanding the determinants of this resting time may provide new insights into the habitat-specific <b>time-budgeting</b> problems that animals face. We analysed the environmental constraints that determine the minimum amount of daytime an average primate has to spend resting, using data {{from a wide range of}} ecologically different species. However, total resting time consists of two components: enforced resting time (imposed on the animal by ecological constraints) and free resting time (the time available for allocation to ecologically functional activities). We show that the ecologically important enforced resting time is determined by diet and annual temperature as well as by temperature variation. Our tests of the biological significance of this relationship show that enforced resting time distinguishes between locations that are suitable or unsuitable for particular genera. We show that an annual temperature increase of 2 - 4 °C would greatly increase enforced resting time, leading to serious <b>time-budgeting</b> problems for many species. The effect of changes to enforced resting time on the biogeographical distribution of species is especially strong for folivorous primates. This study shows that resting time is an important component of animal behaviour that can help us understand extinction risk and geographical distribution of taxa. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R

In this study, we considered the effect {{of an increase in}} predation risk on the diurnal <b>time-budget</b> of three captive duck species during the wintering period. We artificially increased predation risk by disturbing two groups of 14 mallard and teals at different frequencies, and one group of 14 tufted ducks with a radio-controlled stressor.
