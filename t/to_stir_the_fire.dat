60|$|In a {{short time}} the old woman {{had to go to}} the {{fireplace}} <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and when the blaze lit up Halvor, as it used to do when he was at home raking up the ashes, she knew him again.|$|E
60|$|Frances rose, as if restless; {{she passed}} before me <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> {{which did not}} want stirring; she lifted and put down the little {{ornaments}} on the mantelpiece; her dress waved within a yard of me; slight, straight, and elegant, she stood erect on the hearth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third of}} the primary American peace {{organizations}} of {{the first decade of}} the 20th Century was the World Peace Foundation (WPF), a group established in 1909 by millionaire Boston publisher Edwin Ginn as [...] "Edwin Ginn's International School for Peace." [...] This organization was launched with a $1 million endowment and carried on publishing activities, changing its name to the WPF in 1911. As with the Carnegie Foundation, the WPF limited its activities largely to research and publication, attempting to influence political decision-makers with ideas rather than <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> of popular sentiment.|$|R
60|$|Grahame nodded agreement, {{and they}} went out on deck. The town was quiet, and, so far as they could see, only one light burned in it, between the plaza and the alameda. Then an uproar broke out, the clamor {{reaching}} them distinctly over the night water. Grahame, running to the engine-room, shook the drowsy half-breed on watch and ordered him <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> which had been lighted and damped. Then he dropped over the rail into the dinghy with Walthew, {{and as soon as}} they jumped ashore they started for the plaza on a run.|$|R
60|$|Mr Swiveller, who sat {{on another}} stool {{opposite}} <b>to</b> his friend, <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in an excess of sympathy, but said nothing.|$|R
60|$|When {{he got to}} {{the place}} where the light had come from, he saw a wretched little cottage, and through a small pane of glass he saw a couple of old folks inside. They were very old, and as grey-headed as a pigeon, and the old woman had such a long nose that she sat in the chimney corner and used it <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
60|$|And now the {{departures from}} Courcy Castle came rapidly one after another, and there {{remained}} but one more evening before Miss Dunstable's carriage {{was to be}} packed. The countess, in the early moments of Frank's courtship, had controlled his ardour and checked the rapidity of his amorous professions; but as days, and at last weeks, wore away, she {{found that it was}} necessary <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> which she had before endeavoured to slacken.|$|E
60|$|Thus in {{the case}} of Paul. When Doctor Blimber said he made great {{progress}} and was naturally clever, Mr Dombey was more bent than ever on his being forced and crammed. In the case of Briggs, when Doctor Blimber reported that he did not make great progress yet, and was not naturally clever, Briggs senior was inexorable in the same purpose. In short, however high and false the temperature at which the Doctor kept his hothouse, the owners of the plants were always ready to lend a helping hand at the bellows, and <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
50|$|A slice bar has a flatter tip {{and can be}} used <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> up <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> or <b>to</b> {{clear the}} grates of ashes.

60|$|Leaving Gif <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> up <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> so that <b>the</b> Lodge {{might get}} warm once more, the others hurried {{out to the}} woodshed. They made four trips from that place to the {{entryway}} beside the kitchen, each time bringing in all the logs they could carry.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] assented Mrs. March, bustling about <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> up <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> [...] "But I don't know as I mind it at all. Winter is real {{pleasant}} {{when it does}} come, but I must say, I don't fancy these betwixt-and-between days much. Sit up to <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> Theodosia. You {{look real}} blue." ...|$|R
60|$|Pretending {{to read a}} smeary {{newspaper}} long out of date, {{which had}} nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which it was sprinkled all over, {{as if it had}} taken the measles in a highly irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> but still pretended not to know him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I knew another man--let me see--forty {{years ago}} now--who took an old, damp, rotten set of chambers, {{in one of}} the most ancient inns, that had been shut up and empty for years and years before. There were lots of old women's stories about the place, and it {{certainly}} was very far from being a cheerful one; but he was poor, and the rooms were cheap, and that would have been quite a sufficient reason for him, if they had been ten times worse than they really were. He was obliged to take some mouldering fixtures that were on the place, and, among the rest, was a great lumbering wooden press for papers, with large glass doors, and a green curtain inside; a pretty useless thing for him, for he had no papers to put in it; and as to his clothes, he carried them about with him, and that wasn't very hard work, either. Well, he had moved in all his furniture--it wasn't quite a truck-full--and had sprinkled it about the room, so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as possible, and was sitting down before the fire at night, drinking the first glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit, wondering whether it would ever be paid for, and if so, in how many years' time, when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press. [...] "Ah," [...] says he, [...] "if I hadn't been obliged to take that ugly article at the old broker's valuation, I might have got something comfortable for the money. I'll tell you what it is, old fellow," [...] he said, speaking aloud to the press, having nothing else to speak to, [...] "if it wouldn't cost more to break up your old carcass, than it would ever be worth afterward, I'd have a fire out of you in less than no time." [...] He had hardly spoken the words, when a sound resembling a faint groan, appeared to issue from the interior of the case. It startled him at first, but thinking, on a moment's reflection, that it must be some young fellow in the next chamber, who had been dining out, he put his feet on the fender, and raised the poker <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> At that moment, the sound was repeated; and one of the glass doors slowly opening, disclosed a pale and emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel, standing erect in the press. The figure was tall and thin, and the countenance expressive of care and anxiety; but there was something in the hue of the skin, and gaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form, which no being of this world was ever seen to wear. [...] "Who are you?" [...] said the new tenant, turning very pale; poising the poker in his hand, however, and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of the figure. [...] "Who are you?" [...] "Don't throw that poker at me," [...] replied the form; [...] "if you hurled it with ever so sure an aim, it would pass through me, without resistance, and expend its force on the wood behind. I am a spirit." [...] "And pray, what do you want here?" [...] faltered the tenant. [...] "In this room," [...] replied the apparition, [...] "my worldly ruin was worked, and I and my children beggared. In this press, the papers in a long, long suit, which accumulated for years, were deposited. In this room, when I had died of grief, and long-deferred hope, two wily harpies divided the wealth for which I had contested during a wretched existence, and of which, at last, not one farthing was left for my unhappy descendants. I terrified them from the spot, and since that day have prowled by night--the only period at which I can revisit the earth--about the scenes of my long-protracted misery. This apartment is mine: leave it to me." [...] "If you insist upon making your appearance here," [...] said the tenant, who had had time to collect his presence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost's, [...] "I shall give up possession with the greatest pleasure; but I should like to ask you one question, if you will allow me." [...] "Say on," [...] said the apparition sternly. [...] "Well," [...] said the tenant, [...] "I don't apply the observation personally to you, because it is equally applicable to most of the ghosts I ever heard of; but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent, that when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of earth--for I suppose space is nothing to you--you should always return exactly to the very places where you have been most miserable." [...] "Egad, that's very true; I never thought of that before," [...] said the ghost. [...] "You see, Sir," [...] pursued the tenant, [...] "this is a very uncomfortable room. From the appearance of that press, I should be disposed to say that it is not wholly free from bugs; and I really think you might find much more comfortable quarters: to say nothing of the climate of London, which is extremely disagreeable." [...] "You are very right, Sir," [...] said the ghost politely, [...] "it never struck me till now; I'll try change of air directly"--and, in fact, he began to vanish as he spoke; his legs, indeed, had quite disappeared. [...] "And if, Sir," [...] said the tenant, calling after him, [...] "if you WOULD have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses, that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere, you will confer a very great benefit on society." [...] "I will," [...] replied the ghost; [...] "we must be dull fellows--very dull fellows, indeed; I can't imagine how we can have been so stupid." [...] With these words, the spirit disappeared; and what is rather remarkable,' added the old man, with a shrewd look round the table, 'he never came back again.' ...|$|E
50|$|Alexander Brogden died at 88 Lansdown Road, Croydon on 26 November 1892 {{at the age}} of 67. The Times {{records that}} he had been ailing. He was sitting by the fire and accidentally fell against the grate while {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> receiving severe burns. He left a widow and a married daughter. Alexander Brogden and his wife also had a son, James Garstang Brogden, who died before his father. He was born in 1850 and died in 1885..|$|E
60|$|The two parishes {{were near}} enough to the coast {{to be kept in}} anxiety by the French schemes for landing. The tenant of the Winchester College {{property}} at Otterbourne is said to have kept all her goods packed up, and <b>to</b> have <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with a stick all through one winter; and as late as between 1840-50, Mr. Bailey of Hursley still had in his barn the seats that had been prepared to fit into the waggons that were to carry the women into the downs {{in the event of a}} battle.|$|R
60|$|On {{account of}} the snow, it grew dark rapidly, and they had <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> up <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> for light {{as well as for}} warmth. Jed had brought with him a small bag of corn for popping, and also a popper, {{something}} Shep had meant to bring but had forgotten. While some of the boys cleared away {{what was left of the}} meal, Giant and the old hunter popped a pan full of corn, and of this and the cake, candy, and apples they made, later on, what they termed supper.|$|R
60|$|With {{nothing of}} {{importance}} to do and nobody to awaken them, the Rover boys and their chums slept late the next morning. Gif {{was the first to}} get up, and, seeing that the others were still asleep, he made as little noise as possible when he went out into <b>the</b> living-room <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> up <b>the</b> smouldering <b>fire</b> and place upon it a couple of extra logs.|$|R
50|$|He {{set out to}} find them, {{bought a}} horse, and found a cottage with an old couple where the woman had a nose long enough <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with. He asked if they knew the way to Soria Moria Castle, and they did not, nor did the Moon when the old woman asked it, but the old woman traded him a pair of boots that took twenty miles a step for his horse, and asked him to wait for the West Wind. It knew where Soria Moria Castle was, and that there was to be a wedding there. Halvor set out with the West Wind to reach it. There, Halvor put the ring the princess had given him into a cup and had it brought to the princess. She {{recognized}} it and married Halvor instead of the new bridegroom.|$|E
60|$|He had, by this time, {{put down}} the tray for dinner, and was {{employed}} in lighting the lamp, and spreading a cloth on the table. From this employment he desisted in a hurry, <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> and feed <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and then resumed it; the lamp he had lighted, and the blaze that rose under his hand, so quickly changing {{the appearance of the}} room, that {{it seemed as if the}} mere coming in of his fresh red face and active manner had made the pleasant alteration.|$|R
6000|$|The appearance, of the assistants who {{surrounded}} it resembled those phantoms {{which are}} seen in a troubled dream, and at once confirmed the idea he had entertained from the first, {{that they did not}} belong to the human world. Amongst these strange unearthly forms, George Waldeck distinguished that of a giant overgrown with hair, holding an uprooted fir in his hand, with which, from time to time, he seemed <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> blazing <b>fire,</b> and having no other clothing than a wreath of oak leaves around his forehead and loins. George's heart sunk within him at recognising the well-known apparition of the Harz demon, as he had been often described to him by the ancient shepherds and huntsmen who had seen his form traversing the mountains. He turned, and was about to fly; but upon second thoughts, blaming his own cowardice, he recited mentally the verse of the Psalmist, [...] "All good angels, praise the Lord!" [...] which is in that country supposed powerful as an exorcism, and turned himself once more towards the place where he had seen <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> But it was no longer visible.|$|R
60|$|All {{through the}} time of the long war with France there was here, as well as {{everywhere}} else around the coast, fear of a landing of the French. The flat-bottomed boats to bring the French over were actually ready at Boulogne, and the troops mustered to come across in them. On our side, volunteers were in training in case of need, and preparations were made for sending off the women and children inland on the first news of the enemy landing. Not very many years ago there were still to be seen in a barn at Hursley the planks prepared to fit as seats into the waggons that were to carry them away. And a family living here are said to have kept everything packed up, even the fireirons, and <b>to</b> have <b>stirred</b> up <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with a stick during a whole winter. However, by God's blessing and our fleets and armies, the danger was kept from our doors.|$|R
60|$|The greater part, however, Heer Antony observed, {{accounted}} {{for all the}} extraordinary circumstances attending this river, and the perplexities of the skippers which navigated it, by the old legend of the Storm-ship, which haunted Point-no-point. On finding Dolph to be utterly ignorant of this tradition, the Heer stared {{at him for a}} moment with surprise, and wondered where he had passed his life, to be uninformed on so important a point of history. To pass away the remainder of the evening, therefore, he undertook the tale, as far as his memory would serve, in the very words in which it had been written out by Mynheer Selyne, an early poet of the New-Nederlandts. Giving, then, a <b>stir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> that sent up its sparks among the trees like a little volcano, he adjusted himself comfortably in his root of a tree; and throwing back his head, and closing his eyes for a few moments, to summon up his recollection, he related the following legend.|$|R
6000|$|I RE-ENTERED {{the town}} a hungry man; the dinner I had {{forgotten}} recurred seductively to my recollection; {{and it was}} with a quick step and sharp appetite I ascended the narrow street leading to my lodgings. It was dark when I opened the front door and walked into the house. I wondered how my <b>fire</b> would be; <b>the</b> night was cold, and I shuddered at the prospect of a grate full of sparkless cinders. To my joyful surprise, I found, on entering my sitting-room, a good fire and a clean hearth. I had hardly noticed this phenomenon, when I became aware of another subject for wonderment; the chair I usually occupied near the hearth was already filled; a person sat there with his arms folded on his chest, and his legs stretched out on the rug. Short-sighted as I am, doubtful as was the gleam of the firelight, a moment's examination enabled me to recognize in this person my acquaintance, Mr. Hunsden. I could not of course be much pleased to see him, considering the manner in which I had parted from him the night before, and as I walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hearth, <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and said coolly, [...] "Good evening," [...] my demeanour evinced as little cordiality as I felt; yet I wondered in my own mind what had brought him there; and I wondered, also, what motives had induced him to interfere so actively between me and Edward; it was to him, it appeared, that I owed my welcome dismissal; still I could not bring myself to ask him questions, to show any eagerness of curiosity; if he chose to explain, he might, but the explanation should be a perfectly voluntary one on his part; I thought he was entering upon it.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{again as}} he spoke, and having made it blaze, resumed.|$|R
60|$|Softswan did not move, but {{continued}} silently <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> soup {{in the pot}} on <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Perker smiled, took a {{very long}} pinch of snuff, <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> shrugged his shoulders, and {{remained}} expressively silent.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{walked out}} of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit down and <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in {{thoughtful}} vexation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{young person}} {{frequently}} <b>stirs</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with <b>the</b> poker {{to test the}} humour of a lover. If <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> blaze brightly, <b>the</b> lover is good-humoured; and vice versa.|$|R
60|$|I {{rang the}} bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and then took a low seat at my master's knee.|$|R
60|$|Oliver <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Drawing {{her chair}} close to it, she sat there, {{for a little}} time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.|$|R
60|$|Lost in {{the immense}} field of {{conjecture}} opened by this reflection, the elder Mr. Weller laid his pipe on <b>the</b> table, and <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with a meditative visage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expressed}} {{regret that}} he had had to wait; he made no answer, but <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> as if <b>to</b> cover a movement of impatience; then he scanned me again.|$|R
60|$|Here, {{the little}} gentleman paused, {{and took a}} long pull at his brandy-and-water. Mr. Watkins Tottle took a sip of his, <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and assumed an air of {{profound}} attention.|$|R
6000|$|Martin sprang with alacrity to obey; {{for he was}} {{standing}} up with the class at the time, and was glad of the temporary relaxation.

6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} wanted light,' he {{answered}} with a sigh, long, deep, and irrepressible, and as she <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> flame revealed to her the traces of tears. She longed to comfort him, and said-- ...|$|R
