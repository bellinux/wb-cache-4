40|$|Metabolism of polyenoic {{fatty acids}} through the plant {{lipoxygenase}} cascade {{is the source}} of numerous oxylipins [1, 2]. Many of them are involved in plant cell signaling and plant defense. The most abundant polyenoic fatty acids of higher plants, αlinolenic and linoleic acids, are the major lipoxygenase substrates and oxylipin precursors. Many plant species which are called “ 16 : 3 plants ” possess another <b>trienoic</b> <b>acid,</b> namely (7 Z, 10 Z, 13 Z) hexadeca <b>trienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (16 : 3) [3, 4]. As reported previously, the hexadecatrienoic acid is converted in some plants through the lipoxygenase pathway into the jasmonate congener dinor 12 oxo 10, 15 phytodienoic acid [5], as well as into the divinyl ether dinor(ω 5 Z) etherolenic acid [6].

Infants fed by age 2 d had a normal mean linoleate level at 7 d and none showed detectable 20 : 3 w 9 by 10 d. In contrast, infants who were not fed until 7 d showed a very high incidence of abnormal fatty acid status.

40|$|F ROM time to {{time during}} the past few years current {{knowledge}} of the metabolism of the polyunsaturated acids has been reviewed. Each time there have been included bits of information gathered since the last review which bring us somewhat nearer our goal: the complete elucidation of the formation and fate of these acids. Although it cannot truth-fully be said that we have achieved this goal, still, with a little speculation, we can at last begin to see the whole picture rather clearly. Most of the early evidence on the transfor-mnations of the polyunsaturated acids was ob-tamed with the technic of alkaline isomeriza-tion. This technic gave an indication of the alterations in the unsaturated centers of the fatty acids of various tissues but gave little or no information on the alterations of the fatty acids themselves or their transformation to one another. However, interesting and provoca-tive evidence was obtained. For example, it was found that when a dienoic acid (linoleic) was fed to rats on a fat-free diet, the body fatty acids showed an in-crease in diene and tetraene;’ 2 when a <b>trienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (linolenic) was fed, there was an increase in triene, pentaene and hexaene acids in the body fat: 23 when the fat-free diet was con...|$|E
40|$|Coagulation and {{platelet}} aggregation induced by thrombin, ADP, adrenaline, and collagen were studied in three contrasted groups, each of 20 to 22 middle-aged male farmers. Serum lipids {{were similar in}} the three groups. In the west of Scotland group, however, platelet reactivity was significantly greater than in the east of Scotland. This {{was associated with a}} dietary intake, evaluated by three different techniques, higher in saturated fat but also lower in polyunsaturated fat and alcohol. Platelet function in the southern England group also correlated with dietary fats and in addition inversely with calcium intake. On an individual basis in the 63 farmers, all the platelet function tests were significantly correlated with the intake of saturated fat regulated by that of calcium and alcohol. The dietary effects on platelets appear to be mediated by the fatty acid composition of plasma lipids and of platelet phospholipids. In that fraction, the fatty acids 20 : 3 omega 9, 22 : 3 omega 9 and 20 : 4 were the most closely related to the platelet function tests. the <b>trienoic</b> <b>acid</b> 20 : 3 omega 9, identified with essential fatty acid deficiency, was also correlated with the intake of saturated fat and calcium.

40|$|The {{chloroplast}} membranes of all higher plants contain {{very high}} proportions of <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acids.</b> To investigate how these lipid structures {{are important in}} photosynthesis, we have generated a triple mutant line of Arabidopsis that contains negligible levels of <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acids.</b> For mutant plants grown at 22 °C, photosynthetic fluorescence parameters were indistinguishable from wild type at 25 °C. Lowering the measurement temperature led to a small decrease in photosynthetic quantum yield, ΦII, in the mutant relative to wild-type controls. These and other results indicate that low temperature has only a small effect on photosynthesis in the short term. However, long-term growth of plants at 4 °C resulted in decreases in fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, and thylakoid membrane content in triple-mutant plants relative to wild type. Comparisons among different mutant lines indicated that these detrimental effects of growth at 4 °C are strongly correlated with <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> content with levels of 16 : 3 + 18 : 3, approximately one-third of wild type being sufficient to sustain normal photosynthetic function.

Megachile rotundata prepupae possessed copious quantities of internal lipids (20 % of the fresh weight) that were extracted with CHCl 3 /methanol (2 : 1). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that lipids were stored within very large intracellular vacuoles. Separation by silica chromatography revealed that 88 % of the internal lipids were triacylglycerols. Ester derivatives of fatty acids from triacylglycerol components were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 15 fatty acid constituents were identified. The majority (76 %) of the triacylglycerol fatty acids were unsaturated fatty acids. The major triacylglycerol fatty acid constituent (30 %) was the C 16 monounsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (16 : 1, hexadec- 9 -enoic acid), with substantial amounts of linolenic acid (18 : 3, octadec- 9, 12, 15 - <b>trienoic</b> <b>acid,</b> 15 %), palmitic acid (16 : 0, hexadecanoic acid, 14 %) and oleic acid (18 : 1, octadec- 9 -enoic acid, 13 %).

40|$|Temperature {{affects the}} growth and {{productivity}} of plants, but its effect depends on nature of plant species i. e. warm season or cool season plants. Increased temperature, increases rate of photosynthesis and respiration but only up to certain levels of increased temperature; there after it will reduce both photosynthesis and respiration. Increased temperature {{is not only a}} problematic factor for vegetative growth but also for reproductive development like flowering, pollen development, fruit set and finally total yield of the crop plants. The negative effect of high temperature is becoming a major problem because of predicted increase of 2 °C of earth surface temperature by 2050. In present days due to increasing threat of global warming to horticultural crop production, research on high temperature stress in relation to plant productivity becomes important and urgent. Exposure to high temperature causes reduced yields in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The level of proline content of anthers plays important roles in acquiring heat tolerance in tomato but this proline transport to anthers is seriously impaired by heat stress leading to increased level of proline accumulation in leaves (source) instead of developing pollen grains (sink) during heat stress. We made an attempt to develop tomato plants expressing the proline transporter to anthers gene LePROT 1 under the control of HSP 18. 2 promoter from Arabidopsis to increase supply of proline to developing anthers of tomato plants under heat stress. Here we got total six transformed plants after confirmation by PCR. We treated all transformed plants with high temperature at 38 °C for 2 hours along with controls at 3 days before anthesis and then grew at normal temperatures after heat treatment. All transformed plants performed far better than control plants; pollen stainability averaged 93. 98 % in transformed plants and 81. 1 % in untransformed control plants, pollen germinability averaged 91. 55 % in transformed plants and 74. 6 % in untransformed control plants. There was a significant difference in yield between untransformed control plants and plants transformed with LePROT 1 gene. All these differences in pollen stainability, germinability and in total yields were positively correlated with proline content in their developing anthers at 3 days before anthesis stage. Proline quantity is significantly different between untransformed control plants (860. 87 !M/g FW) and plants transformed with LePROT 1 gene (2117. 74 !M /g FW). In this same experiment we also did attempt to screen drought and salt tolerance in plants transformed with LePROT 1 and untransformed control plants in early seedlings stage by artificial invitro stress II treatments. Seeds from T 1 generation plants and control plants were germinated and allowed to grow on artificial medium supplemented with 50 g/l PEG to induce drought stress conditions and grown at 38 °C for one week. Plants transformed with LePROT 1 gene showed higher growth rate than untransformed control plants in terms of root length. Transformed plants had higher root length (9. 19 cm) than control plants (6. 66 cm) and {{there was no significant difference}} between control and transformed plants in hypocotyl length under drought stress. This increased root length in transformed plants than control plants is in accordance with their higher proline accumulation. Untransformed control plants accumulated less proline content (6. 82 !g /g FW) and transformed plants accumulated more proline (11. 94 !g/g FW) under artificial drought conditions. Seeds from T 1 generation plants and control plants were germinated and allowed to grow on artificial salt stressed medium supplemented with 100 mM NaCl to induce salt stress conditions and grown at 38 °C for one week. Plants transformed with LePROT 1 showed significant differences in both root length (9. 42 cm) and hypocotyl length (4. 74 cm) than the root length (6. 16 cm) and hypocotyl length (1. 66 cm) of untransformed control plants. These differences in root and hypocotyl lengths of control and transformed plants was positively correlated with their proline content i. e. control plants accumulated less proline (17. 3 !g/g FW) than LePROT 1 transformed plants (25. 16 !g/g FW). Proline content in all three treatments i. e. heat stress, salt and drought stress is higher in heat stress and then followed by salt and drought stresses. Plants can acquire inducible environmental stress resistance by remodeling of membrane fluidity. Plants ability to adjust membrane lipid fluidity, achieved by changing levels of unsaturated fatty acids through fatty acid desaturase genes, is a feature of stress acclimation. Modification of membrane fluidity results in an environment suitable for the function of critical integral proteins. Membrane fatty acids play main important role in tolerance to high temperature. Plastid omega- 3 fatty acid desaturase catalyzes the conversion of dienoic fatty acids (16 : 2 and 18 : 2) to trienoic fatty acids (16 : 3 and 18 : 3) in glycerolipids which are the main constituents of chloroplast membranes. Exposure to high temperature causes reduced yields in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). We produced transgenic tomato plants that express the transcript of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of tobacco plastid omega- 3 fatty acid desaturase gene Nt FAD 7 to induce post transcriptional gene silencing. The steady state messenger-RNA level of targeted gene was low in transformed plants. Under the heat stress III these transformed plants silenced for this gene showed higher number of viable pollen grains (92. 79 %) and higher yields (90 fruits/ 6 plants) when compared to the viable pollen (74. 6 %) and yield (25 fruits) untransformed plants. These results indicated that post transcriptional gene silencing of omega 3 fatty acid desaturase gene is useful to increase tolerance to high temperature in plants. In this experiment trienoic fatty acids quantity in transformed plants was from 10 to 45 % less than the trienoic fatty acid composition of control plants and correspondingly increased dienoic fatty acids in transformed plants. Transformed seedlings growing under heat stress at 32 °C for one week performed far better than the untransformed seedlings in terms of hypocotyl length (3. 6 cm) than the control plant hypocotyl length (1. 5 cm). These results indicate that down-regulation of the transcript level in the NtFAD 7 by introduction of NtFAD 7 dsRNA constructs is useful to decrease the trienoic fatty acid contents of the vegetative tissues in higher plants and give tolerance for higher temperature. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the accumulation of proline through proline transporter in relation to heat stress under the control of heat inducible promoter and decrease of <b>trienoic</b> <b>acid</b> formation through gene silencing could be useful methods to increase heat tolerance in tomato and it could be a solution to increase crop yields under this present arena of global warming.

In Arabidopsis, and other species, the levels of <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> decline substantially at higher temperatures. Several genetic studies indicate that reduced unsaturation improves photosynthetic function and plant survival at high temperatures. Here, these studies are extended using the Arabidopsis triple mutant, fad 3 - 2 fad 7 - 2 fad 8 that contains no detectable <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acids.</b> In the short-term, fluorescence analyses and electron-transport assays indicated that photosynthetic functions in this mutant are more thermotolerant than the wild type.

Screening of an M 2 population derived from the fad 7 - 1 line led to the identification of a line, SH 1, in which the proportion of <b>trienoic</b> <b>acids</b> was much less than in fad 7 plants. The segregation pattern of F 2 progeny from a cross between SH 1 and wild type indicated that the additional fatty acid mutation in SH 1 is at a new locus, designated fad 8. In a genetic background that was wild type at the FAD 7 locus, the fad 8 mutation had no detectable effect on overall leaf fatty acid composition irrespective of the temperature at which plants were grown. However, fatty acid analyses of individual leaf lipids revealed small decreases in the levels of 18 : 3 in two chloroplast lipids.

40|$|The biophysical {{reactions}} of light harvesting and electron transport during photosynthesis {{take place in}} a uniquely constructed bilayer, the thylakoid. In all photosynthetic eukaryotes, the complement of atypical glycerolipid molecules that form the foundation of this membrane are characterised by sugar head-groups and a very high level of unsaturation in the fatty acids that occupy the central portion of the thylakoid bilayer. alpha-linolenic (18 : 3) or a combination of 18 : 3 and hexadecatrienoic (16 : 3) acids typically account for approximately two-thirds of all thylakoid membrane fatty acids and over 90 % of the fatty acids of monogalactosyl diacylglycerol, the major thylakoid lipid [1, 2].

Similar results were obtained with pea (Pisum sativum cv. Victory Freeze), linseed (Linum usitatissimum cv. Punjab), and wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Karamu). With these species, a greater proportion of the label was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine and less into diacylgalactosylglycerol than with spinach. The data indicate that trienoate synthesis uses diacylgalactosylglycerol as substrate. BASF 13 - 338 appears to act at that step, and seems to cause in spinach a shift in polyenoate synthesis from the pathway involving microsomal phosphatidylcholine to the pathway operating inside the chloroplast...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project mainly focused on developing air drying alkyds with 65 % oil length which offer superior film properties using locally available a suitable fatty oil and also developing {{a mathematical model}} to predict the gel point acid value in manufacturing alkyd resins. Analysis of seed oil of 'Karawila' MC 43 indicated {{that it was a}} fatty oil rich in conjugated <b>trienoic</b> <b>acids</b> with moderate amount of saturated fatty acids. The oil content of seed of MC 43 was about 24 % and the weights of dried seeds were in the range 2. 98 - 7. 93 g with weight ratio of kernel to seed in dry basis of about 0. 6. Acid value of the oil was 2. 73 mg g", saponification value was 190. 70 mg g-l and iodine value was 115. 96 cg g". The seed oil of MC 43 showed better drying properties compared to common drying oils. A simple mathematical model was developed to predict the iodine value of fatty oils based on the total number of pi-bonds in the fatty acid profile (π) as Iodine value equals 0. 8683 x π Since the acid value of seed oil of MC 43 was comparatively low, monoglyceride process was selected in manufacturing alkyd resins. The optimum heating rate, mixing speed and the volume ratio were first established for the laboratory reactor used in the experiment. Better film properties could be obtained when a mixture of glycerol and pentaerythritol was used as polyols with excess OH. Film properties were compared by gradually increasing the pentaerythritol content while keeping oil length at 65 % until the industrial specifications for film properties were obtained. Excellent film properties were obtained when the minimum ratio of pentaerythritol/glycerol was 0. 33 and the OHICOOH ratio was in the range of 1. 23 to 1. 4. Satisfactory film properties were obtained when OHICOOH ratio was in between 1. 23 to 1. 48 with pentaerythritol / glycerol ratio within 0. 23 to 0. 33. When pentaerythritol / glycerol ratio was lower than 0. 2, hardness was not acceptable. The results of kinetic studies on polyesterification of monoglyceride mixture based on seed oil ofMC 43 with pthalic anhydride suggested that the way of assigning order to the reaction based on correlation coefficient was unsatisfactory. This was mainly due to the simultaneous occurrence of several reaction mechanisms associated with steric hindrance of reacting molecules. A new mathematical model was developed to predict the acid value at gel point based on the statistical approach of proposing the growth pattern of alkyd molecules during the polyesterification reaction. Proposed model was compared with the existing models using the actual data recorded in literature. The predicted acid values from the proposed model gave minimum deviation from actual data compared to existing models. However, the predicted acid values of alkyd resins based on MC 43 seed oil deviated significantly from the experimental data due to the presence of conjugated <b>trienoic</b> <b>acids</b> in the fatty oil of MC 43. Hence, a modification was introduced to incorporate the effects of dimerization reactions and the predicted results were then closely agreed with the actual dat...|$|R

Under conditions specifically designed to stabilize the oligomeric form in vitro, we show that the oligomeric form of dicot light-harvesting complex II is twice as stable to solubilization in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) than that observed for monocots. This decreased stability of monocot light-harvesting complex II is associated with a twofold increase in the <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> level of thylakoid phosphatidylglycerol but with no significant changes in the <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> levels in the major galactolipids. In addition, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analyses with monoclonal antibodies indicated that monocots exhibited greater heterogeneity in the polypeptide complements associated with subfractions of light-harvesting complex II than the dicots examined. The data indicate that the oligomeric form of the light-harvesting complex II is not the result of a simple oligomerization of a common monomeric unit. We suggest that the difference in stability of the oligomeric form of light-harvesting complex II in isolated thylakoids of monocots and dicots is probably due to a differential accessibility to SDS. The differential SDS accessibility may be due to differences in thylakoid protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions...|$|R

Triglycerides and free fatty acids were the most abundant lipid classes in 32 hour cultures of both species. In A. niger, total lipid of dry weight varied from 2. 7 % to 6, 1 % while P. chrysogenum ranged from 1. 1 % to 2, 2 %. The per cent water in the wet mycelium varied from 97. 1 % to 97. 7 i% for A. niger and ranged from 94. 4 % to 95, 1 % in P. chrysogenum. In A. niger, saturated fatty acids from octanoic (C 8) to behenic (C 22) were found with palmitic (C 16) being the most abundant. No cyclopropane structures {{were found on the}} saturated acids present, Monoenoic acids from dodecenoic acid (C 12 : 1) through oleic acid (C 18 : 1) were found.

40|$|Conjugated {{fatty acids}} have {{attracted}} much attention as a novel type of biologically beneficial functional lipid. Some isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduce carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis and body fat. Considering the use of CLA for medicinal and nutraceutical purposes, a safe isomer-selective process of production is required. The introduction of biological reactions for CLA production could be an answer. We screened microbial reactions useful for CLA production and found several unique reactions in microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria produced CLA from linoleic acid. The CLA, which was obtained as the free fatty acid form, comprised a mixture of cis- 9, trans- 11 - octadecadienoic acid (18 : 2) and trans- 9, trans- 11 - 18 : 2. Furthermore, lactic acid bacteria transformed ricinoleic acid [12 -hydroxy-cis- 9 - octadecenoic acid (18 : 1) ] to CLA (a mixture of cis- 9, trans- 11 - 18 : 2 and trans- 9, trans- 11 - 18 : 2). Castor oil, rich in the triacylglycerol form of ricinoleic acid, was also found {{to act as a}} substrate for CLA production by lactic acid bacteria with the aid of lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Filamentous fungi transformed trans-vaccenic acid (trans- 11 - 18 : 1) to cis- 9, trans- 11 - 18 : 2 by Δ 9 desaturation. This CLA was obtained as a triacylglycerol.

Fluorescence polarization measurements indicated that the fluidity of the thylakoid membranes was not significantly altered by the mutation. Similarly, on the basis of temperature-induced fluorescence yield enhancement measurements, there was no significant effect on the thermal stability of chlorophyll-protein complexes in the mutant.

We now show that treatment of cultured parsley cells with a defined peptide elicitor of fungal origin causes rapid and large changes in the levels of various unsaturated fatty acids. While linoleic acid decreased and linolenic acid increased steadily for several hours, comparatively sharp increases in oleic acid followed a biphasic time course. In contrast, the overall level of stearic acid remained unaffected. Using a PCR-based approach, a parsley cDNA was isolated sharing high sequence similarity with ω- 3 fatty acid desaturases. Subsequent isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA enabled its functional identification as a plastid-localized ω- 3 fatty acid desaturase by complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana fad 7 / 8 double mutant which is low in <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acids.</b> ω- 3 Fatty acid desaturase mRNA accumulated rapidly and transiently in elicitor-treated cultured parsley cells, protoplasts, and leaves, as well as highly localized around fungal infection sites in parsley leaf buds.

Abstract A new cold-inducible genetic construct was cloned using a chloroplastspecific omega- 3 -fatty acid desaturase gene (FAD 7) {{under the control of}} a cold-inducible promoter (cor 15 a) from Arabidopsis thaliana. RT-PCR confirmed a marked increase in FAD 7 expression, in young Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Havana) plants harboring cor 15 a-FAD 7, after a short-term exposure to cold. When young, cold-induced tobacco seedlings were exposed to low-temperature (0. 5, 2 or 3. 5 o C) for up to 44 days, survival within independent cor 15 a-FAD 7 transgenic lines (40. 2 to 96 %) was far superior to the wild type (6. 7 to 10. 2 %). In addition, the major <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> species remained stable in cold-induced cor 15 a-FAD 7 N. tabacum plants under prolonged cold storage while the levels of hexadecatrienoic acid (16 : 3) and octadecatrienoic acid (18 : 3) declined in wild type plants under the same conditions (79 % and 20. 7 % respectively).

40|$|Reduced {{levels of}} <b>trienoic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> (TAs) in {{chloroplast}} membranes induce thermotolerance in several plant species, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} remain unclear. TA peroxidation in plant cell membranes generates cytotoxic, TA-derived compounds containing alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl groups. The relationship between low TA levels and the amounts of cytotoxic TA-derived compounds was examined using thermotolerant transgenic cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum Mill.) with low TA contents. Changes in the levels of the cytotoxic TA-derived acrolein (ACR), methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), (E) - 2 -hexenal, 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal, and malondialdehyde were analysed in the leaf tissues of wild-type (WT) and thermotolerant transgenic cyclamen under heat stress. Levels of ACR and MVK in the WT increased in parallel with the occurrence of heat-induced tissue damage, whereas no such changes were observed in the thermotolerant transgenic lines. Furthermore, exogenous ACR and MVK infiltrated into leaves to concentrations similar to those observed in heat-stressed WT leaves caused similar disease symptoms. These results suggest that thermotolerance in transgenic cyclamen depends on reduced production rates of ACR and MVK under heat stress, due to {{the low level of}} TAs in these plants.

Here, we describe a Thr residue located in the fourth transmembrane domain of fatty acid desaturase 7 (FAD 7) that {{is essential for the}} biosynthesis of ω- 3 fatty acids in C. reinhardtii. The ω- 3 fatty acid deficiency in strain CC- 620, which contains a putative missense mutation at Thr 286 of CrFAD 7, was recovered by the overexpression of CC- 125 CrFAD 7. A Ser substitution in position 286 was able to partially complement the phenotype of the ω- 3 fatty acid deficiency, but other substitution variants, such as Tyr, His, Cys, and Gly, failed to do so. Prediction of the phosphorylation target site revealed that Thr 286 may be phosphorylated. Analysis of the structural conformation of CC- 620 CrFAD 7 via topology prediction (and bends in the helix) shows that this missense mutation may collapse the catalytic structure of CrFAD 7.

However, the precise contribution of the other plastidial ω- 3 desaturase, FAD 8, is poorly understood. Fatty acid and lipid analysis of several ω- 3 desaturase mutants, including two insertion lines of AtFAD 7 and AtFAD 8, showed that FAD 8 partially compensated the disruption of the AtFAD 7 gene at 22 °C, indicating that FAD 8 was active at this growth temperature, contrasting to previous observations that circumscribed the FAD 8 activity at low temperatures. Our data revealed that FAD 8 had a higher selectivity for 18 : 2 acyl-lipid substrates and a higher preference for lipids other than galactolipids, particularly phosphatidylglycerol, at any of the temperatures studied. Differences in the mechanism controlling AtFAD 7 and AtFAD 8 gene expression at different temperatures were also detected. Confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis of FAD 8 -YFP over-expressing lines confirmed the chloroplast envelope localization of FAD 8. Co-localization experiments suggested that FAD 8 and FAD 7 might be located in close vicinity in the envelope membrane. FAD 8 -YFP over-expressing lines showed a specific increase in 18 : 3 fatty acids at 22 °C.
