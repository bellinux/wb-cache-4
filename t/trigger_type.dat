50|$|Failure in {{regulating}} glyceroneogenesis {{may lead to}} Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by high level of blood glucose and blood lipid. Type2 diabetes {{can be caused by}} over production of triglycerides in liver due to excessively active glyceroneogenesis, or excess release of fatty acids from adipose tissues. Since the activity of glyceroneogenesis is mostly dependent on PEPC-K, fluctuating the expressions for PEPC-K will dramatically influence the activity of glyceroneogenesis. Over expressing PEPC-K in liver will eventually result in over production of triglycerides which can elevate the lipid level in the bloodstream. Conversely, in adipose tissue, down regulated glyceroneogenesis may <b>trigger</b> <b>Type</b> 2 diabetes. Suppressed glyceroneogenesis will result in increase of free fatty acids in the adipose tissues, because re-esterification of free fatty acid will not occur. Therefore, glyceroneogenesis overly induced in liver and reduced in adipose tissues may be the trigger for Type2 diabetes.|$|E

50|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I - IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues <b>trigger</b> <b>Type</b> III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop.

These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} allocation {{system is}} capable of dynamically reallocating functions between different agents. In adaptive allocation, the need for reallocation can be determined using different parameters (trigger mechanisms) such as fluctuation in workload or changes in physiology of the human agent. The adaptation strategy can {{determine the amount of}} reallocation and set the new level of the automated agent. The first experiment evaluated the effects of <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> (performance or heart rate) and adaptation strategy (complete reallocation or partial transformation) on the number of errors made. The presence of adaptive allocation reduced the number of errors. The ANOVA results indicate interaction effect between the <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> and adaptation strategy. Due to the presence of an interaction effect, interpretations of the main effects of <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> or adaptation strategy type are difficult. The combination of a partial transformation strategy and heart rate trigger mechanism resulted in substantially more (nearly 114 %) errors than other combinations. The errors made in the other combinations were not significantly different. The second experiment monitored the level of automation over time for presence of stabilization. There is no strong evidence to indicate that the time to stabilization is less than 30 minutes. As the time to stabilization is more than 30 minutes, inferences about main effect of <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> or adaptation strategy could not be made. Based on the contingency table analyses, there appears to be an effect of adaptation strategy on the mean level of automation and the effect of <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> on the time of onset of stabilization. Based on the post-hoc ANOVA analyses, there appears to be an interaction effect between the trigger types and adaptation strategy type on the number of reallocations and the probability of a change in level of automation being observed. ...|$|E

40|$|Males {{and females}} differ in both {{parasite}} load {{and the strength}} of immune responses and these effects have been verified in humans and other vertebrates. Sex hormones act as important modulators of immune responses; the male sex hormone testosterone is generally immunosuppressive while the female sex hormone estrogen tends to be immunoenhancing. Different sets of T-helper cells (Th) have important roles in adaptive immunity, e. g. Th 1 cells <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> 1 responses which are primarily cell-mediated, and Th 2 cells <b>trigger</b> <b>type</b> 2 responses which are primarily humoral responses. In our review of the literature, we find that estrogen and progesterone enhance type 2 and suppress type 1 responses in females, whereas testosterone suppresses type 2 responses and shows an inconsistent pattern for type 1 responses in males. When we combine these patterns of generally immunosuppressive and immunoenhancing effects of the sex hormones, our results imply that the sex differences in immune responses should be particularly strong in immune functions associated with type 2 responses, and less pronounced with type 1 responses. In general the hormone-mediated sex differences in immune responses may lead to genetic sexual conflicts on immunity. Thus, we propose the novel hypothesis that sexually antagonistic selection may act on immune genes shared by the sexes, and that the strength of this sexually antagonistic selection should be stronger for type 2 - as compared with type 1 -associated immune genes. Finally, we put the consequences of sex hormone-induced effects on immune responses into behavioral and ecological contexts, considering social mating system, sexual selection, geographical distribution of hosts, and parasite abundance...|$|E

Among the induced target genes, type I interferons (IFNs) are central to the antiviral response of the host. The receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the strong induction of the synthesis of these cytokines have long remained elusive. In the past few years, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) emerged as important sensors of infections. Several TLRs participate in the recognition of virus infection, interacting in particular with viral nucleic acids. Upon activation, TLRs interact with different cytosolic adapter molecules and activate transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor families that concur to mediate induction of IFN-alpha/beta and other inflammatory cytokines.

Our calculations indicate that the existence of circumbinary disk can enhance the mass transfer rate and cause secular orbital shrinkage.
