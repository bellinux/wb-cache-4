5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook <b>Touch</b> series has <b>touch</b> screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook <b>Touch</b> series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but with a <b>touch</b> enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a <b>touch</b> enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the <b>touch</b> screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook <b>Touch</b> at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E

The Music <b>Touch</b> special series was also added to the C4 Picasso, C4 Aircross and Berlingo Multispace vehicles.|$|E

30|$|Making use of {{the machine}} {{learning}} technique becomes a standard way to classify intended <b>touches</b> and unintended <b>touches.</b> In general, the technique is used to reject all unintended <b>touches</b> which are considered as unnecessary. Most unintended <b>touches</b> are generated by a writing hand, and thus, those <b>touches</b> indicate where the writing hand itself is. This means that the information of unintended <b>touches</b> enables the production of the dynamical occlusion area.|$|R
5|$|The royal <b>touch</b> (also {{known as}} the king's <b>touch)</b> {{was a form of}} laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic <b>touch</b> was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's <b>touch</b> cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E

40|$|I {{introduce}} a puzzle about contact and de re temporal predication in relativistic spacetime.

In the case I present, the most that A is ever in a position to say is: ‘I am now <b>touching</b> B, but this is the only instant at which this will ever be so’. B, on the other hand, can say: ‘I was formerly <b>touching</b> A, I am currently <b>touching</b> A, and I will in the future be <b>touching</b> A’. (And neither object is a time traveler. ...|$|R
