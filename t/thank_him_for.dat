They fly to Paris, where the other soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski {{can get into the}} Louvre. Just before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> getting her as far as he did. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he manages to drop a belt of grenades, killing the Omega.|$|E
5|$|Winding {{down his}} tour, Kalākaua's {{schedule}} became less hectic. He {{spent most of}} August 27 relaxing in his hotel suite in Paris, and attending to his personal correspondence. A little sightseeing was done {{over the next two}} days: Napoleon's tomb at Les Invalides, Bal Mabille, the Louvre, and Palais Bourbon. Dutch heir-apparent Alexander, Prince of Orange, visited the King to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the Grand Cross of the Order of Kalākaua. The King spent his remaining day in the city, August 30, in his hotel suite, saying his farewells.|$|E
5|$|Having secured patent {{protection}} for his designs and general adoption by the Brandywine millers, Evans now {{turned his attention}} outside Delaware. His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans's work, and according to some sources, by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery. When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence, he saw Evans's technology {{at work in the}} mills in Brandywine Village and was so impressed that had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791, the completion of which was overseen by Evans's brothers. In 1793, Evans sold his share in the Red Clay Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia, where he opened a store for milling supplies.|$|E

5|$|When mysterious shadow monsters begin {{attacking the}} SSS, Takamatsu gets devoured by one, only to {{reappear}} as an NPC. Otonashi reasons {{with the other}} SSS members {{and many of them}} agree to pass on in lieu of becoming an NPC, including the rest of Girls Dead Monster, Chaa of the Guild, and several unnamed members. Yuri destroys the computers responsible for the shadow program, which was programmed to activate when love was detected in the world, to prevent it from becoming a true paradise and maintain its limbo state. Those who are left—Otonashi, Yuri, Kanade, Hinata and Naoi—hold a graduation ceremony where they thank each other for their support. After Naoi, Yuri and Hinata pass on, Otonashi learns that Kanade's regret was not being able to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the heart she received from Otonashi after his death. Otonashi is heartbroken after she thanks him and passes on, as he has fallen in love with her. In the epilogue, two people resembling Otonashi and Kanade meet each other on the street in the real world. In an alternative epilogue, Otonashi is shown to have stayed behind in the afterlife to help people pass on.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, {{for the first time in}} its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before Disneyland opened for the day, a private {{ceremony}} was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of Disneyland. The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named Marie E. and a caboose, rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used to run it on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was Pixar film director John Lasseter, who had brought the train to Disneyland in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the Marie E., and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the Marie E., the caboose, and an assortment of train cars on his private Justi Creek Railway, which is complemented by the depot building and water tower from Ward Kimball's former Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{working for}} Leyla and {{develops}} feelings for David, who pays her attention. Amy sleeps with Cain {{and tries to}} make David jealous. When Alicia steals £500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her.

Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but at the clinic, learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption.

Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship.|$|E

25|$|After the Second Restoration, {{in order}} to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his loyalty Louis XVIII named him State Councillor on the spot, and, on 27 December 1815, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. In July, he sent him to Marseilles to be Prefect of Bouches-du-Rhône, and to {{liberate}} five to six hundred Bonapartist prisoners, a surprising act which was appropriate under the circumstances (Marseilles being under English control, and convulsed by anti-Bonapartist violence).|$|E
25|$|U.S. President George W. Bush called Sullenberger to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{saving the}} lives of the passengers, as did President-elect Barack Obama, who also invited him and the crew to join the presidential inauguration ceremony.

25|$|White has {{provided}} {{financial support to}} institutions {{in his hometown of}} Detroit. In 2009, White donated almost $170,000 towards the renovation of the baseball diamond in southwest Detroit's Clark Park. The Detroit Masonic Temple was nearly foreclosed on in 2013 after it was revealed that owners owed $142,000 in back taxes. In June 2013, it was revealed that White had footed the entire bill. To <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the donation, the temple has decided to rename its second largest theater the Jack White Theater.|$|E
25|$|The consuls swore their oath {{of office}} in Jupiter's name, and honoured him on the annual feriae of the Capitol in September. To <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his help (and to secure his {{continued}} support), they offered him a white ox (bos mas) with gilded horns. A similar offering was made by triumphal generals, who surrendered the tokens of their victory {{at the feet of}} Jupiter's statue in the Capitol. Some scholars have viewed the triumphator as embodying (or impersonating) Jupiter in the triumphal procession.|$|E

25|$|A month later, 25 October, at Stuttgart, Richard Strauss {{conducted}} the première of his Ariadne auf Naxos. The {{first and third}} performances were with the élite soloists Maria Jeritza, Margarethe Siems, Herman Jadlowker: the second was the Stuttgart team, Erb as Bacchus. In May 1913 at the Imperial performance at Wiesbaden he sang Hüon in Oberon. The Kaiser said to him, 'You must be a good Lohengrin. Tell Baron von Putlitz I <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> having sent such a good performer of Huon.' Erb's farewell to Stuttgart after his six years there was as Lohengrin.|$|E
25|$|At 9pm on 10 May, Chamberlain {{announced}} {{the change of}} Prime Minister over the BBC. Churchill's first act as Prime Minister was to ask Attlee {{to come to the}} Admiralty to see him. Next, he wrote to Chamberlain to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his promised support. He then began to construct his coalition cabinet: before he went to bed at 3 am on Saturday, 11 May, six hours after Chamberlain's original announcement, Churchill had established the composition of the new War Cabinet, including the heads of the Service Ministries.|$|E
25|$|Ottoman {{immigration}} {{had been}} defended by La Rioja Senator Joaquín V. González. The Senate session was on 12 September 1910, {{few days before}} Arslan's arrival to Buenos Aires, on 29 October 1910. Since Arslan was aware {{of that kind of}} criticism, right from his first press interviews he announced {{that he was going to}} favor the dedication of his fellows to agriculture. Short after his arrival he visited Senator González to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his defense of the Syro-Ottoman community. Since they were both fluent in French they could communicate without a translator. They became close friends until González's demise in December 1923.|$|E

25|$|When {{the kidnappers}} finally reduced their demands to $3 million, Getty senior {{agreed to pay}} no more than $2.2 million—the maximum that would be tax deductible. He lent his son the {{remaining}} $800,000 at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a filling station of Lauria, {{in the province of}} Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed {{for the rest of his}} life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011 at the age of 54.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1940, {{hours before}} the German {{invasion}} of France by a lightning advance through the Low Countries, it became clear that, following failure in Norway, the country had no confidence in Chamberlain's prosecution {{of the war and}} so Chamberlain resigned. The commonly accepted version of events states that Lord Halifax turned down the post of prime minister because he believed he could not govern effectively {{as a member of the}} House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Although the prime minister does not traditionally advise the King on the former's successor, Chamberlain wanted someone who would command the support of all three major parties in the House of Commons. A meeting between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill and David Margesson, the government Chief Whip, led to the recommendation of Churchill, and, as constitutional monarch, George VI asked Churchill to be prime minister. Churchill's first act was to write to Chamberlain to <b>thank</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his support.|$|E
