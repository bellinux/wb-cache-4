Typically, wide, straight grooves {{have a low}} noise level and good water removal. More lateral grooves usually increase traction. Sipes are small grooves that are cut across larger <b>tread</b> <b>elements.</b> Up to a point, more sipes give more traction in snow or mud.|$|E
5000|$|The UTQGS {{traction}} rating procedure specifies {{that the}} traction coefficients for asphalt and for concrete {{are to be}} calculated using the locked-wheel traction coefficient on the tire, or sliding coefficient of friction. More specifically, upon application of the brakes, the tire is subjected to shear between the wheel and the road surface, and deforms towards {{the rear of the}} vehicle. This generates a traction force to oppose the motion of the vehicle. As braking torque increases, the tire deforms more and <b>tread</b> <b>elements</b> near the rear of the contact patch with the road begin to slip rather than grip. The coefficient of friction rapidly reaches a maximum value at about 10-20 percent slip, and then declines as the longitudinal slip values increase to 100 percent, which represents a fully locked tire. The maximum coefficient of friction in the 0-100 percent slip range is termed “peak” coefficient of friction, and the lower coefficient value for the fully locked tire is termed “slide” coefficient of friction.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a comprehensive analytical tire model for both vehicle dynamic simulation and tire design. The model {{is composed of}} two parts [...] modeling of the contact mechanism and determination of the tire forces/moments. A static circular beam model is introduced for the contact mechanism, in which a tire is modeled with three compliance components [...] 6 -DOF spring/damper elements for the sidewall and the internal pressure, a flexible circular beam for the belt layers, {{and a series of}} radial springs for the tread. This contact model can estimate the 2 -D contact shape and the contact pressure distributions for even or uneven road surfaces. The tire forces and moments are represented with the deformation of the <b>tread</b> <b>elements.</b> Two different methods are introduced to estimate deformations of <b>tread</b> <b>elements</b> [...] -direct measuring method and integrating deformation rate method. In the former, the deformations of <b>tread</b> <b>elements</b> are directly measured by monitoring their displacements. In the latter, a tread deformation is obtained by integrating the slip velocity over the contacting time. By employing a rigid ring concept, the transient characteristics of the tire can also be examined in low frequency ranges. The ideas that are presented in this study are verified with a set of measurement data. For example, the tire forces/moments for various driving conditions such as combined slip conditions as well as pure lateral and longitudinal slip conditions. Also, the simulation results of 2 -D contact pressure distributions are given for straight running and severe slip angle conditions...|$|E
5000|$|A non-zero {{slip angle}} arises because of {{deformation}} in the tire carcass and tread. As the tire rotates, the {{friction between the}} contact patch and the road results in individual tread 'elements' (finite sections of tread) remaining stationary {{with respect to the}} road. If a side-slip velocity u is introduced, the contact patch will be deformed. When a <b>tread</b> <b>element</b> enters the contact patch, the friction between the road and the tire causes the <b>tread</b> <b>element</b> to remain stationary, yet the tire continues to move laterally. Thus the <b>tread</b> <b>element</b> will be ‘deflected’ sideways. While it is equally valid to frame this as the tire/wheel being deflected away from the stationary <b>tread</b> <b>element,</b> convention is for the co-ordinate system to be fixed around the wheel mid-plane.|$|R

The present paper presents a numerical model aimed at investigating tire performance and soil compaction under different conditions, considering effects due to tangential and normal compliance of the terrain surface as well as tread design and inflating pressure. In particular, the ground has been modelled as a deformable springs layer and the tire as a flexible ring reproducing the tread geometry.

In this work, the physical mechanism of the generation of the two-dimensional contact pressure distribution for a non-rolling tyre is studied. Towards this aim, a physical tyre model is constructed, consisting of an analytical ring under pretension, a non-linear sidewall foundation, and a discretised foundation of viscoelastic elements representing the tread. Tread behaviour is examined first, with focus on the development of shear micro-slip. The tread simulation is enhanced with the combination of radial and tangential <b>tread</b> <b>elements</b> and the benefits of such an approach are identified. Subsequently, the contact of the complete model is examined by implementing an algorithm for transient simulations in the time domain. The effects of the imposed vertical load and sidewall non-linearity on the contact stress and strain fields are identified. The modelling approach is validated by comparison with published experimental results. The physical mechanism that couples the torsional and horizontal/vertical deformations of the carcass with the frictional forces at the tread is identified and discussed in detail. The proposed modelling approach is found appropriate for the description of the development of the two-dimensional contact pressure field {{as a function of the}} frictional potential of the contact...|$|E

40|$|Two {{algorithms}} {{for obtaining}} static contact solutions {{are described in}} this presentation. Although they were derived for contact problems involving specific structures (a tire and a solid rubber cylinder), they are sufficiently general {{to be applied to}} other shell-of-revolution and solid-body contact problems. The shell-of-revolution contact algorithm is a method of obtaining a point load influence coefficient matrix for the portion of shell surface that is expected to carry a contact load. If the shell is sufficiently linear with respect to contact loading, a single influence coefficient matrix can be used to obtain a good approximation of the contact pressure distribution. Otherwise, the matrix will be updated to reflect nonlinear load-deflection behavior. The solid-body contact algorithm utilizes a Lagrange multiplier to include the contact constraint in a potential energy functional. The solution is found by applying the principle of minimum potential energy. The Lagrange multiplier is identified as the contact load resultant for a specific deflection. At present, only frictionless contact solutions have been obtained with these algorithms.

40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} one of the main sources of {{acoustic}} pollution, with an ubiquitous presence in anthropised environments. Therefore, it is a constant component of residual noise during every noise measurement. The generation and propagation of traffic noise is governed by three main different mechanisms: vehicles' power unit (i. e. the engine, gearbox and cooling system), vehicles' profile aerodynamics and tyre-road interaction. While engine noise is the main source up to 35 km/h, for higher speeds propulsion noise is negligible over noise due to tyre/road interaction. For heavy vehicles, like lorries, the contribution of propulsion noise cannot be neglected even at higher speeds. Tyre/road interaction depends greatly on the characteristics of road surfaces: a subtle difference in road surfaces may yield a large variation in noise levels. This idea has lead to a series of studies that focused on providing theoretical and phenomenological analysis of the influence of road profile on noise emission. The characterisation of a road surface requires the measurement of its profile: the device used to carry out these measurements is known as profilometer; modern road profilometry is based on laser triangulation sensors, which allow a simple and direct measurement of road texture. The purpose of this work, carried out at the CNR spin-off company iPool srl, was to develop a laser profilometer focused on measuring the macrotexture and megatexture of road pavements, which cover wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as the size of tyre <b>tread</b> <b>elements</b> and of the tyre/road interface and to verify some of the existing models to predict tyre rolling noise based on road texture knowledge. This work confirms the importance of macrotexture (MaTx) and part of megatexture (MeTx) in the generation of rolling noise. The profilometer, mounted on a vehicle, is composed of a laser displacement sensor, an accelerometer, known in jargon as inertial unit and a rotary encoder attached to a wheel, which provides the horizontal travelled distance. This profilometer presents many strong points, viz. a simple usage and relative low cost compared to other laser profilometers; moreover it presents a new procedure to obtain the road profile by combining the information provided by the laser output, a time-domain displacement signal and a record of the distance travelled by the vehicle, measured by the angular encoder. Chapter 1 provides a description of the main terminology and devices used in profiling, while chapter 2 deals the essential theoretical background of the dominant phenomena involved in the generation of rolling noise and describes the main models that correlate rolling noise and road texture. Chapter 3 accurately explains every component the profilometer; it is roughly divided in two main parts, the first one outlines the hardware components specifications and limits, while the second part overviews the signal processing. An algorithm in Matlab environment for data processing was also developed, dealing with the re-mapping of the time-domain vertical displacement signal with a constant sampling frequency to a space-domain profile, sampled every 0. 5 mm, and subsequent evaluation of road texture parameters has been conducted on different sites. A simple mathematical model of road texture enveloped by the tyre has also been used during data analysis, simulating the actual road surface that is in contact with the tyre. The following chapter addresses the possible sources of uncertainty of profiling operations. A theoretical model of the response of the laser sensor at different wavelengths has also been developed, taking into account the finite spot size of the laser and the finite exposure time of the pixel array. These two factors contribute to the identification of the working range of the sensor. Chapter 5 presents a calibration of the device and consequent assessment of reproducibility and repeatability of measurements. Calibration has dealt with every component singularly through specific measurements, such as measurements of the lateral profile of a rotating disc with cogs of different sizes, calibration of the accelerometer with a B&K calibrator and an oscillating bar, and the measurement of the profile of a surface with known characteristics. Repeatability of measurements has been thoroughly verified, via repetitions of measurements of the same road profile; reproducibility has been checked by measuring the same road profile with another profilometer already available on the market, and owned by the Department of Civil Engineering of Università di Pisa. Finally, an evaluation of the correlation between rolling noise and road texture is presented in chapter 6. Measurements of road texture provided by the profilometer are correlated with rolling noise emission on six different kinds of pavements: again, the chapter can be divided in two main sections. The former deals with the calculation of the correlation coefficient between parameters related to road texture, such as third-octave bands texture spectrum and rolling noise measured by CPX method, while the latter deals with the comparison of two existing models and the elaboration of a simple model to obtain the mean CPX broadband level of a road surface based the knowledge of its texture spectrum. The model uses two bands of the octave band texture spectrum, to predict rolling noise: the octave band centred at 5 mm, related to air pumping, is negatively correlated to sound generation, while the band at 80 mm shows a positive correlation, related to tyre vibrations. One of the main innovations of this model, despite the limited number of samples, is the usage of enveloped texture, which distinguishes road surfaces with sharp edges and deep grooves. The correlations found confirm the theoretical knowledge of tyre/road noise, but also underline that a complete description of rolling noise must take into account not only road texture, but also the tyre itself. In fact, a resonance in the CPX noise spectrum at 80 km/h was also successfully identified. The further perfectioning of the profilometer will permit deeper studies of the correlation between properties of road texture and rolling noise, and to develop a comprehensive model of tyre/road interaction noise: possible improvements are the simultaneous usage of two or more displacement sensors that profile adjacent lines, in order to reduce uncertainty in the evaluation of texture spectrum and the substitution of the current sensor with one that has a smaller spot size...|$|E
50|$|The tire <b>tread</b> and {{sidewall}} <b>elements</b> undergo deformation {{and recovery}} {{as they enter}} and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV) and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, Hunter Engineering introduced the GSP9700 Road Force balancer, which is equipped with a load roller similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity. This machine can find the best position for the tire on a given wheel so that the over-all assembly is as round as possible.|$|R
