5|$|The {{paintings}} on the back wall are recognized as representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and <b>the</b> <b>dreadful</b> consequences. One scholar {{points out that the}} legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is {{on the same side of}} the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.|$|E
5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him not guilty of personally killing anyone and not guilty of overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for <b>the</b> <b>dreadful</b> conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

However, he took eight wickets at Lord's and made his only Test fifty at the Oval.

The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture.

Aṣṭāvakra is constantly worried about how he would liberate his father from the bondage of Bandī. He realises that his pointing out of Kahola's mistakes and arguing with Kahola was not his prerogative, even though Kahola was wrong. He concludes that his arguments ended up angering Kahola which led to the unfortunate curse, anger being <b>the</b> <b>dreadful</b> enemy of man. Aṣṭāvakra decides to perfect the scriptures – the Vedas, Upavedas, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, Dharma, Āgama and other texts. He entreats Uddālaka for instruction in the scriptures. In a short time, Aṣṭāvakra masters all that Uddālaka teaches, helped by his Ekaśruti (ability to forever remember everything that one has heard even once). Uddālaka calls Aṣṭāvakra to give him a final instruction about the Ātman, and orders him to go to the assembly of Janaka with the goal of liberating his father. Uddālaka decides to send the now-repentant Śvetaketu with Aṣṭāvakra, even though the former had insulted the latter in the past. Aṣṭāvakra determines that this task will be his Gurudakṣiṇā, and bows down to Uddālaka. Uddālaka blesses him to be victorious, and so does Sujātā. Aṣṭāvakra undertakes the ambitious journey to Mithilā, along with his uncle Śvetaketu.|$|E
