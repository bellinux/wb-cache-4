5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him not guilty of personally killing anyone and not guilty of overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for <b>the</b> <b>dreadful</b> conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra is constantly worried about how he would liberate his father from the bondage of BandÄ«.

Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra decides to perfect the scriptures â the Vedas, Upavedas, NyÄya, MÄ«mÄá¹sÄ, Dharma, Ägama and other texts. He entreats UddÄlaka for instruction in the scriptures. In a short time, Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra masters all that UddÄlaka teaches, helped by his EkaÅruti (ability to forever remember everything that one has heard even once). UddÄlaka calls Aá¹£á¹­Ävakra to give him a final instruction about the Ätman, and orders him to go to the assembly of Janaka with the goal of liberating his father.
