5|$|The War Memorial and {{the parks}} in the plaza are {{an example of the}} City Beautiful movement, which {{supported}} classical, uniform, and beautiful public architecture. The plaza covers a five-block strip north of Monument Circle between St. Clair, Pennsylvania, New York, and Meridian Streets. In 1989, the plaza was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it was named a National Historic Landmark District in 1994. The Historic District includes the plaza as well as the Indianapolis Public Library, immediately north of the plaza, and the Birch Bayh Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, immediately south. The Scottish Rite Cathedral is across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> {{the west side of the}} plaza, and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> the east side.|$|E

Around 1751-2, a court house was built at the western end of <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>on</b> the corner of what is now Piccadilly Place.

5|$|A {{week after}} the {{non-stop}} protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests began {{on the evening of}} 26 April in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire. Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying a large portion of <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>On</b> the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident {{was the first one to}} happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters.|$|E

5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was {{a relic of the}} merger of two railway schemes. The station building is close to the Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Santos visited {{some friends}} in New York City's Barrio Latino, during this visit Santo's was walking through <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> a Saturday evening when he fainted and collapsed. He was {{attended}} by some bystanders and residents of the neighborhood who called the New York City Police Department. When the police arrived at the scene they transported him to a local hospital, Santos was released two days after. During this time Santos was also suffering from mental illnesses, including memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease. Despite his health he made final presentations in some of Puerto Rico's municipalities where he received recognitions in San Juan and Ponce. Santos was also {{invited to participate in}} a music festival in Cuba, where he was supposed to receive a homage, but he was unable to attend.|$|E

Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E

He {{was buried}} in Rookwood Cemetery in a grave which was unmarked until 1971, when the Mount Druitt sub-branch of the Returned Services League of Australia paid for a headstone. The Blacktown City Council also renamed <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> which {{he lived in the}} suburb of Minchinbury to John Hines Avenue, and a {{monument}} commemorating him was built at the nearby Mount Druitt Waterholes Remembrance Garden in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a reading list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
5|$|The Whitehall Theatre {{opened in}} 1930 {{at the north}} west end of <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>on</b> a site that had {{previously}} been Ye Old Ship Tavern in the 17th century. The revue Whitehall Follies opened in 1942, which drew controversy over its explicit content featuring the stripper and actress Phyllis Dixey. The theatre became known for its farces, reviving a tradition on Whitehall that had begun with court jesters at the palace during the 16th century. These included several plays featuring actor-manager Brian Rix throughout the 1950s and 60s, and 1981's satirical Anyone for Denis, written by John Wells and Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams. The venue was Grade II listed in 1996, and renamed the Trafalgar Studios in 2004.|$|E

Church is seen throughout the video either playing with his band in a garage, {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> a piano, or walking through the streets with an American flag around his shoulders while singing. The video ends without showing whether the girl and boy ended up together.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury Castle was {{designed}} by Jeter O. Frye and constructed between 1929 and 1931. Immediately following construction, Frye was unable {{to sell the house}} and left Portland in bankruptcy to resume his career in California. Visitors immediately showed interest in touring the house. The castle attracted paying tourists and school groups, became a stop on the Washington Park bus tour and hosted Halloween parties for a local radio station. The house became known as Canterbury Castle over time due to the plat and name of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> which it was situated. The terraced garden was eliminated in the 1950s when a portion of the land was sold. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under the ownership of Dale and Karen Bernards, who had submitted an application for listing one year prior.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>on</b> or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>On</b> the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
