500|$|In 1994, Fleury {{joined a}} group that {{involved}} his former junior coach, Graham James, fellow NHL player Joe Sakic, and professional wrestler Bret Hart as a minority owner of the expansion Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League. He sold {{his share of the}} team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James' conviction for sexually abusing Sheldon Kennedy and another player. After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009. He filmed a pilot episode in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid: [...] "We want to show people <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dream, anything is possible with a little ambition," [...] Fleury said of the show. It was not picked up by any network.|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E

60|$|Him and {{the mate}} 'elped the silly old {{thing to the}} ship, and, arter I 'ad been round to the Bear's Head and fetched a pint for the police-man, I locked up {{and sat down to}} think things out; and the more I thought the worse they seemed.

"I mean," [...] replied Val Dor, [...] "that {{you are not}} of Manator {{and that}} {{if you wish to}} hide the fact it is well that you speak not to a Manatorian as you did just speak to me of--Fliers! There be no Fliers in Manator and no piece in their game of Jetan bearing that name. Instead they call him who stands next to the Chief or Princess, Odwar. The piece has the same moves and power that the Flier has in the game as played outside Manator. Remember this then and remember, too, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> secret it be safe in the keeping of Val Dor of Helium." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{sounds a}} big thing," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "but {{there was nothing in}} it, and the whole thing was over in less time than it takes to talk about it. Well, I hope I shall either get off to Portsmouth again to-morrow or go down to the dear old pater. I wish this dinner was over. No doubt there will be some more of these old admirals there, and they will be wanting to learn all the ins and outs, just as if twenty words would not tell them how it was we thrashed them so easily. They know well enough <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> quick handy craft, and get her under the weather quarter of a slow-moving frigate the latter hasn't a shadow of a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the only}} thing that struck him as being at all in his way was his wife. In her cap and apron, or her Sunday print she had always looked as dainty and {{fetching}} a little piece of goods as a man could wish to be seen out with. Dressed according to the advice of his new-found friends, of course she looked like nothing else so much as a barn-yard chicken in turkey-cock's feathers. He was shocked to find that her size in gloves was seven-and-a-quarter, and in boots something over four, {{and that sort of thing}} naturally irritates a woman more even than finding fault with her immortal soul. I guess for about a year he made her life pretty well a burden for her, trying to bring her up to the standard of the Saturday- to-Monday-at-Brighton set with which he had surrounded himself, or which, to speak more correctly, had got round him. She'd a precious sight more gumption than he had ever possessed, and if he had listened to her instead of insisting upon her listening to him it would have been better for him. But there are some men who think <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> taste for champagne and the ballet that proves you are intended by nature for a nob, and he was one of them; and any common-sense suggestion of hers only convinced him of her natural unfitness for an exalted station.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{we shall}} do awfully badly in Syracuse {{the last half}} of this week. And why? For one thing, because the show isn't a show at all at present. Why should people flock to pay for seats for what are {{practically}} dress-rehearsals of an unknown play? Half the principals have had to get up in their parts in two weeks, and they haven't had time to get anything out of them. They are groping for their lines all the time. The girls can't let themselves go in the numbers, because they are wondering {{if they are going to}} remember the steps. The show hasn't had time to click together yet. It's just ragged. Take a look at it in another two weeks! I know! I don't say musical comedy is a very lofty form of art, but still there's a certain amount of science about it. If you go in for it long enough, you learn the tricks, and take it from me <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good cast and some catchy numbers it's almost impossible not to have a success. We've got an excellent cast now, and the numbers are fine. I tell you--as I tried to tell Pilkington, only he wouldn't listen--that this show is all right. There's a fortune in it for somebody. But I suppose Pilkington is now sitting in the smoking-car of an east-bound train, trying to get the porter to accept his share in the piece instead of a tip!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You mean, why do I {{not deny}} what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no doubt heard?" [...] he said. [...] "What could one gain by <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> heard the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{plenty of}} money. It {{all depends on}} <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> plenty of money, and your fancy goes that way, it is all very well. Come, we'll go upstairs." ...|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, it {{is proper}} {{to add that}} the {{principle}} of influencing human character and action by noticing and commending what is right, rather than finding fault with what is wrong, is of universal application, with the mature {{as well as with}} the young. The susceptibility to this influence is in full operation in the minds of all men everywhere, and acting upon it will lead to the same results in all the relations of society. The way to awaken a penurious man to the performance of generous deeds is not by remonstrating with him, however kindly, on his penuriousness, but by watching his conduct till we find some act that bears some semblance of liberality, and commending him for <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> neighbor who is surly and troublesome--tell him that he is so, and you make him worse than ever. But watch for some occasion in which he shows you some little kindness, and thank him cordially for such a good neighborly act, and he will feel a strong desire to repeat it. If mankind universally understood this principle, and would generally act upon it in their dealings with others--of course, with such limitations and restrictions as good sense and sound judgment would impose--the world would not only go on much more smoothly and harmoniously than it does now, but the progress of improvement would, I think, in all respects be infinitely more rapid.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "you've {{changed a}} lot in three months. I always thought <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a chance, there'd be no telling where you'd end up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How clever!" [...] {{said the}} merry old gentleman, [...] "I knew <b>you</b> would do <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done any {{differently}} {{there would have}} been no point to the fable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{examples}} of flat morphisms {{can be found}} using [...] "miracle flatness" [...] which states <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> morphism [...] between a cohen-macaulay scheme to a regular scheme with equidimensional fibers, then it is flat. Easy {{examples of}} this are elliptic fibrations, smooth morphisms, and morphisms to stratified varieties which satisfy miracle flatness {{on each of the}} strata.|$|E
50|$|In the finite-length situation, {{decomposition}} into indecomposables {{is particularly}} useful, {{because of the}} Krull-Schmidt theorem: every finite-length module can be written as a direct sum of finitely many indecomposable modules, and this decomposition is essentially unique (meaning <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different decomposition into indecomposable, then the summands of the first decomposition can be paired off with the summands of the second decomposition so {{that the members of}} each pair are isomorphic).|$|E
5000|$|Much of the show's humour {{derived from}} {{political}} incorrectness and black humour. For example: Penne explains that roadside tributes are an ideal {{place to get}} fresh flowers; Dr Rudi endorses fattening up one's daughter to prevent boys from wanting {{to have sex with}} her because [...] "It's better to have a fatty boombah in the family than a filthy slut"; Sigourney recommends <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bad haircut, shave your head and tell your friends that you have had chemotherapy.|$|E

5000|$|Popular music {{historian}} Colin Larkin {{wrote that}} [...] "Another Day in Paradise" [...] had been widely criticised. Collins addressed the {{criticism from the}} English rock press {{at the time of}} its release, who found him unqualified to sing about the poor due to his wealth, by saying: [...] "When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It's a misconception <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of money you're somehow out of touch with reality." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{premiere of}} the work in the Soviet Union is also worth noting since it was given just three days after the Paris premiere by two 19-year-olds, Nathan Milstein and Vladimir Horowitz. Horowitz played the orchestral part on the piano. Milstein later wrote in his memoirs, From Russia to the West, [...] "I feel <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great pianist like Horowitz playing with you, you don't need an orchestra." [...] Milstein and Horowitz also {{introduced}} Karol Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto at the same concert.|$|E
50|$|Mark Regev, {{spokesman}} for the Prime Minister of Israel, referring to the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, said:The San Remo memorandum states, specifically 67A, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> boat that is charging a blockaded area you are allowed to intercept even prior to it reaching the blockaded area if you've warned them in advance, and that we did a number of times, {{and they had a}} stated goal which they openly expressed, of breaking the blockade.
