5|$|Phoenixs {{first call}} to action came on April 2, 1955. A four-alarm blaze at <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building</b> greatly damaged {{the north end of}} the building; losses came to $750,000. Other notable fires that Phoenix fought include Pier 70 burning in 1980, and a lengthy battle at Piers 30–32 {{throughout}} the night of May 9–10, 1984—a five-alarm explosive conflagration which destroyed the piers and caused an estimated $2.5million in damage.|$|E

Across The Embarcadero is <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building,</b> and the eastern end of the California Street cable car line is on the other side of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, the Market Street Cable Railway {{opened its}} first line. This company was {{controlled}} by the Southern Pacific Railroad and was to grow to become San Francisco's largest cable car operator. At its peak, it operated five lines all of which converged into Market Street to a common terminus at <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building.</b> During rush hours, cars left that terminus every 15 seconds.|$|E

25|$|The F Market Line (historic {{streetcar}} service) in San Francisco, {{opened in}} 1995, runs along Market Street from The Castro to <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building,</b> then along the Embarcadero {{north and west}} to Fisherman's Wharf. This line {{is run by a}} mixture of PCC cars built between 1946 and 1952, and earlier pre-PCC cars. Due to its success, a second heritage line was inaugurated in 2015, the E Embarcadero, which serves to facilitate a one-seat ride from the Caltrain San Francisco Station to Fisherman's Wharf. Although San Francisco had removed PCCs from revenue service when the city's light rail was transformed into the Muni Metro system in 1980, they had made occasional festival trips in the ensuing years before being returned to full-time service. Car 1074 is painted in the livery of the Toronto Transportation Commission, but this car was never in the TTC roster.|$|E
25|$|From 1989 until January 2008, KRON-TV {{produced}} a countdown program called New Year's Live, which aired on New Year's Eve (sometimes beginning at 11 p.m.) and continued into New Year's Day (sometimes ending at 1 a.m.). Events in San Francisco were {{the focal point}} of KRON's coverage, especially the midnight fireworks show near <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building.</b> Other West Coast television stations joined KRON in some years (including KCAL-TV/Los Angeles, KING-TV/Seattle, KCRA/Sacramento, KNSD/San Diego and KLAS-TV/Las Vegas in December 1990), featuring midnight countdown events in other cities, such as Las Vegas casinos and at the Seattle Space Needle. Former KRON weather anchor Mark Thompson served as the host during the program's early years. New Year's Live returned to KRON in December 2010 as an hour-long broadcast, hosted by Catherine Heenan and George Rask in-studio, with live reports from Henry Tenenbaum at Pier 39 and Vicki Liviakis at Waterbar on the Embarcadero. Starting in 2011, Gary Radnich joined Heenan as host at various locations in San Francisco each year.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{urbanization}} {{of the city}} due to the geographical feature of [...] "Cruesoe's Island" [...] and surrounding coal mining property created a density not seen in many cities of its size. The city at the time with a population nearing 10,000 was forced to tightly cram homes and businesses upon the sandstone outcropping less than a square mile in diameter leading many to build their buildings with multiple stories around the town square. The Saline County courthouse and square have gone through many transformations within the past 100 years. In the 19th century, the town had dirt streets with a large Greek Revival courthouse with Doric columns built by Swiss-born, Evansville, Indiana Architect J. K. Frick & Co in 1861. The courthouse was then replaced in 1906 with a larger building designed by then well-known architect John W. Gaddis of Vincennes, Indiana. The structure was an identical model to the Perry County Courthouse at Perryville, Missouri, both built the same year. A smaller version of the central clock tower of the courthouse, including the original clock, manufactured by the Howard Clock Company, of Boston Massachusetts in 1904 was recreated in 1996, {{and placed in a}} small lot behind the Clearwave Building's parking lot. The Howard clock company was notable for manufacturing large clocks in such buildings as the Wrigley Building in Chicago, and <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building</b> in San Francisco, California. The town square was completely surrounded by brick streets in 1906. Harrisburg had [...] of brick streets, but now only a few blocks are left.|$|E

2500|$|Transbay Ferries: Ferry service between San Francisco and Oakland, {{which had}} ended decades before, was revived during the month-long {{closure of the}} Bay Bridge as an {{alternative}} to the overcrowded BART. A ferry terminal was put together in Alameda, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged a suitable ferry dock at the Berkeley Marina. Additionally, the demolition of the quake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway led to <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building</b> Terminal renovation, increasing the efficiency of ferry service to the peninsula. The passenger-only service proved popular and continues to expand its service. [...] The need for a robust ferry system in the event that the region's roads and tunnels become impassable in an emergency led to the creation of the San Francisco Bay Ferry system.|$|E

6000|$|They had dined {{together}} in San Francisco, and were at <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building,</b> returning to Oakland, when the whim {{came to him}} to show Martin the [...] "real dirt." [...] He turned and fled across the water-front, a meagre shadow in a flapping overcoat, with Martin straining {{to keep up with}} him. At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of old port, and with one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car, Martin at his heels burdened with several quart-bottles of whiskey.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not much}} of a blow at first. A Christian Endeavor {{convention}} being held in San Francisco, a row was started by Express Drivers' Union No. 927 over the handling of a small heap of baggage at <b>the</b> <b>Ferry</b> <b>Building.</b> A few heads were broken, a score of arrests made, and the baggage was delivered. No one would have guessed that behind this petty wrangle was the fine Irish hand of Hegan, made potent by the Klondike gold of Burning Daylight. It was an insignificant affair at best--or so it seemed. But the Teamsters' Union took up the quarrel, backed by the whole Water Front Federation. Step by step, the strike became involved. A refusal of cooks and waiters to serve scab teamsters or teamsters' employers brought out the cooks and waiters. The butchers and meat-cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants. The combined Employers' Associations put up a solid front, and found facing them the 40,000 organized laborers of San Francisco. The restaurant bakers and the bakery wagon drivers struck, followed by the milkers, milk drivers, and chicken pickers. The building trades asserted its position in unambiguous terms, and all San Francisco was in turmoil.|$|E
