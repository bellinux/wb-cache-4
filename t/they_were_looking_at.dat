In December 2009, Halcyon {{issued a statement saying}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> various options including sale and refinancing of the rights with an announcement on the outcome no later than February 1, 2010. On February 8, 2010, an auction was held to determine the owner of the Terminator rights. After studios Sony Pictures and Lionsgate bid separately, Pacificor, the hedge fund that pushed Halcyon into bankruptcy, made a deal for $29.5 million. Pacificor hired an agency to sell off the rights to the franchise.|$|E

25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b> Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E
25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located {{at the tip of}} a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E

500|$|David Crane and Marta Kauffman began {{developing}} {{three new}} television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom Family Album was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about [...] "six {{people in their}} 20s making their way in Manhattan" [...] to NBC, since {{they thought it would}} fit best there. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a time when the future was [...] "more of a question mark." [...] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed [...] "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time.

500|$|An initial study {{published}} in 1988 by a researcher from Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrated the then-current population of 180 horses was over-grazing the island. The researcher recommended reducing the herd size to between 49 and 73 animals, which she contended was the maximum size that the island could support without environmental damage. The study showed that the horses were significantly reducing plant stocks on the island, and reducing future plant production due to trampling. A 1991 study of genetic variation in feral horse herds on eastern US barrier islands was conducted by researchers from the University of Georgia and University of Kentucky. The study concluded that a herd of 122 was the minimum size necessary to prevent inbreeding. The researchers noted that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> herd size solely as it related to genetic variation, and did not take environmental damage into consideration. In addition, {{it was found that}} due to the large amount of introduced blood from outside horses, the Cumberland Island horses were not genetically unique. Due to this, and the ongoing environmental damage, it was concluded that the horses met neither the genetic nor the environmental requirements for feral horses on public lands, and that the herd should be reduced or removed completely. The researchers conceded, however, that their analysis did not take [...] "local historical and cultural elements" [...] into consideration, only environmental and genetic.|$|E

500|$|After {{their first}} trip to the Himalaya and {{subsequent}} labor problems, the Workmans hired Matthias Zurbriggen, the best and most experienced mountain climbing guide of the time. Thus, in 1899, with 50 local porters and Zurbriggen, the Workmans began to explore the Biafo Glacier in the Karakoram, but dangerous crevasses and poor weather forced them instead to shift to the Skoro La Glacier and the unclimbed peaks around it. They reached Siegfriedhorn, an 18,600-foot (5,700 m) summit that she named after her son, giving Fanny an altitude record for women at the time. They next camped at [...] and climbed a higher peak of , naming it Mount Bullock Workman. Admiring the view of a far-off mountain, they commented on the grand view: <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> K2, the second-highest mountain in the world. Fanny Workman may have been the first woman recorded to have seen it. Finally, they climbed Koser Gunge (...) , giving Fanny her third successive altitude record. It was very challenging: they had to hire new porters, establish a new base camp, and remain overnight at around [...] In the morning, they climbed a wall that measured , and were buffeted by winds. During the summit push, Fanny's fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her ice ax and one of the porters abandoned them. Pauly writes, [...] "propelled to the summit by adrenalin and desperation, the foursome lingered only long enough for their instruments to assess that the temperature was ten degrees Fahrenheit [...] and their elevation was 21,000 feet." [...] Fanny was a [...] "slow, relentless, and intrepid" [...] climber; [...] "bearlike, she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another secure grip with the other". Climbing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, she did not have specialized equipment like pitons or carabiners. She was able to climb to such heights, Pauly argues, because of [...] "her dauntless persistence and her immunity to altitude sickness".|$|E
500|$|Films {{are a major}} form of entertainment, {{although}} not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: [...] "The Lumière brothers {{were the first to}} send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public." [...] In 1908, Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. [...] "In {{the first decade of the}} [...] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms." [...] The Americans first [...] "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," [...] but [...] "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle". Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. Animation, for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences. The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 21st century made it [...] "possible to do spectacle" [...] more cheaply and [...] "on a scale never dreamed of" [...] by Cecil B. DeMille. From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the [...] "only mass entertainment" [...] but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced. Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and fantastic) but also to animate non-living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form. Creators of The Lego Movie [...] "wanted the audience to believe <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer." [...] The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre, recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.|$|E
