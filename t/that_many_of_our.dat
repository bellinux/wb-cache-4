I ask forgiveness {{for the fact that}} I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

American economist Steven Rosefielde noted the doctrine's influence on current U.S. policy: [...] "Our nation seeks coalitions and alliances with other nations for tactical purposes when at war, and reserves our overall strategy-making to ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{editorial}} of The News International {{noted that}} the attack [...] "is {{a reminder that the}} internal challenges we face are even greater and cannot be blamed on other countries". An editorial in The Nation also mentioned that [...] "the narrative will soon turn towards blaming the 'foreign hand' that feed terrorists in Pakistan, it must be remembered <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> terrorist groups are entities that are very much based in Pakistan". The editorial in Dawn also echoed that [...] "the country's civil and military leaderships will unite to condemn the attacks and bemoan them as an attempt to sabotage CPEC by outside forces. While there may be some truth to those allegations, the twin attacks in Mastung and Gwadar almost certainly have very local roots".|$|E
2500|$|HaKohen {{argued that}} [...] "both {{narratives}} are equally valid and {{so long as}} they seek to negate or eclipse one another, both peoples will continue to suffer." [...] "Even if one narrative were to finally win out over the other, it would lead to injustice for at least one of us. The sad truth is that Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank actually undermines the Jewish people's legitimate right to Judea and Samaria. The Jews in Judea are not the Americans in Afghanistan. We don’t occupy some foreign people’s homeland. The problem is <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> political and military leaders behave like the Americans in Afghanistan, bestowing credibility on claims we don’t belong in our own country. ... The bottom line is that in order for both peoples to achieve justice without creating any new injustices for either of us, we need to collectively arrive at a larger narrative big enough to encompass both seemingly rival narratives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because Althusser {{held that}} a person's desires, choices, intentions, preferences, judgements, and so forth are the {{products}} of social practices, he believed it necessary to conceive of how society makes the individual in its own image. Within capitalist societies, the human individual is generally regarded as a subject endowed with the property of being a self-conscious, [...] "responsible" [...] agent whose actions {{can be explained by}} his or her beliefs and thoughts. However, for Althusser, a person's capacity to perceive himself or herself in this way is not innate or given. Rather, it is acquired within the structure of established social practices, which impose on individuals the role (forme) of a subject. Social practices both determine the characteristics of the individual and give him or her an idea of the range of properties that he or she can have, and of the limits of each individual. Althusser argues <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> roles and activities are given to us by social practice: for example, the production of steelworkers is a part of economic practice, while the production of lawyers is part of politico-legal practice. However, other characteristics of individuals, such as their beliefs about the good life or their metaphysical reflections {{on the nature of the}} self, do not easily fit into these categories.|$|E

In mercantile language, the person who thus acquires is commonly said to have [...] "made a profit;" [...] and I believe <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> merchants are seriously under the impression that it is possible for everybody, somehow, to make a profit in this manner. Whereas, by the unfortunate constitution of the world we live in, the laws both of matter and motion have quite rigorously forbidden universal acquisition of this kind.
