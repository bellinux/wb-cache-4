5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father {{suggested that he}} {{take a break and}} play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who suggested that he <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour.

25|$|When Mohammad Khodabanda was crowned shah, the Safavid aristocracy, officers, {{and provincial}} {{governors}} wanted approval from Pari Khan Khanum {{to give him}} a congratulating visit. Pari Khan Khanum's sphere of influence and authority was so dimensional that no one had the courage to visit Shiraz without her unambiguous approval. From the day Mohammad Khobanda was appointed shah, his wife Khayr al-Nisa Begum, who was better known by her title of Mahd-e Olya, took control of his affairs.

25|$|In 1960, the U.S. {{government}} uncovered {{an attempt}} to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including {{the largest in the}} industry (Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis-Chalmers), with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis-Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy-electrical cartel was that it was a desperate (and foolish) attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.|$|E
25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, they walked into a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E

500|$|The {{track was}} refined with {{remixing}} and additional parts added on 20 January and 3 February. During the latter session, McCartney and Starr re-recorded their contributions on bass guitar and drums, respectively. Starr later highlighted his fills on the song as typical of an approach whereby [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> an instrument; play {{the mood of}} the song. For example, 'Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire,' – boom ba bom. I try to show that; the disenchanting mood." [...] As on the 1966 track [...] "Rain", music journalist Ben Edmonds recognises Starr's playing as reflective of his empathy with Lennon's songwriting. In Edmonds' description, the drumming on [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] "transcends timekeeping to embody psychedelic drift – mysterious, surprising, without losing sight of its rhythmic role".|$|E
500|$|Concerned {{about the}} children's education, Ms. Ellen reveals she will buy {{dinner for the}} winner of a {{spelling}} test.

500|$|He {{continued}} {{for several years}} to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a published author. His diaries, which he began in 1923 and {{continued for}} the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write. The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold) forced him to take jobs as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested. He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt. During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany. He also began to study the [...] "social question" [...] and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske. According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels' diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied by [...] "religious-philosophical" [...] issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the völkisch nationalist movement.|$|E
