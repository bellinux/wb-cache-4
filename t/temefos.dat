50|$|Vector control measures, {{especially}} mosquito control, {{are essential}} to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining swamps and removal of other pools of stagnant water (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Insecticides can be applied in rural and urban areas, inside houses and other buildings, or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use {{of some of these}} chemicals is controversial, and some organophosphates and organochlorides (such as DDT) have been banned in many countries. Infertile male mosquitoes have been introduced in some areas {{in order to reduce the}} breeding rate of relevant mosquito species. Larvicides are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. <b>Temefos</b> is a common mosquito larvicide.People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing personal protective measures such as sleeping under mosquito nets, wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellents such as permethrin and DEET to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: personal protective measures and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas. Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill juvenile (larvae) and adult mosquitoes.|$|E

Utilizaram-se 44 béqueres de 1. 000 ml (8 para cada apresentação e 4 controles). Em cada béquer introduziram-se diariamente 25 larvas. Após 24 horas, contavam-se as larvas mortas, esvaziavam-se os béqueres até 200 ml, repunha-se o volume original e acrescentavam-se novas larvas. A duração do efeito residual máximo (100 % de mortalidade) foi: A- 19; B- 39; C- 40; D- 8; E- 19 dias. A razão de mortalidade permaneceu equivalente entre todos os larvicidas durante 25 dias; B e C mostraram RM 2, 40 vezes maior do que E entre 46 - 95 dias; B, comparado com A, mostrou RM 1, 90 - 7, 51 vezes maior entre 26 - 95 dias. Conclui-se pela maior eficácia de duas apresentações do <b>temefos,</b> mesmo em uma situação epidemiológica de longa exposição ao produto e com renovação de água dos recipientes. The {{residual effect}} of <b>temefos</b> (commercial applications A, B and C) and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (D and E) on Aedes aegypti larvae was evaluated, in recipients with water renewal. Forty-four beakers of 1, 000 ml each (8 for each application and 4 controls) were used. In each beaker, 25 larvae were introduced daily. After 24 hours, the dead larvae were counted, the beakers emptied to 200 ml and refilled to original volume, with addition of new larvae. The {{duration of the}} maximum residual effect (100 % of mortality) was: A- 19; B- 39; C- 40; D- 8; E- 19 days. The mortality ratio of all applications remained equivalent for 25 days; B, C and E maintained MR equivalent up to 45 days; B and C showed MR 2. 40 times greater than E, between 46 - 95 days; B, compared with A, showed MR 1. 90 - 7. 51 times greater between 26 - 95 days.

40|$|Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is a {{dangerous}} infectious disease caused by the dengue virus and is transmitted through the bite of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. DHF control depends on controlling mosquitoes and larvae. Currently larvicidal control still uses <b>temefos,</b> although some studies have reported the presence of resistance. Larvicides that WHO recommended as a substitute <b>temefos</b> is permethrin. In addition there are some new larvicides derived from the class of insect growth regulator (IGR) which contain active pyriproksifen and active ingredients methopren. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of larvicides and effective concentration to kill 50 % of larvae of Aedes aegypti from the sub Banjarmasin West. This study is an experimental study design with Posttest-Only Control Group Design with permethrin dose group was 0. 0015 g / l; 0. 0018 g / l; 0. 002 g / l; 0. 0022 g / l; 0. 0025 g / l; and 0. 0030 g / l, for pryriproksifen use dose groups of 0. 5 ppm, 0. 1 ppm, 0. 05 ppm, 0. 01 ppm, 0. 008 ppm, 0. 005 ppm, and methopren with dosis 0 group g / l, 0, 0063 g / l, 0. 0025 g / l, 0. 005 g / l, 0. 01 g / l, and 0. 1 g / l. Each treatment group was exposed to larvae of Aedes aegypti larvae and change shape {{as well as the}} deaths were followed for 10 days. The results showed that the effective dose of permethrin kills 50 % of larvae (Lethal Concentration / LC 50) 24 hours ranged from 24 hour LC 50 0. 01439 - 0. 01829 mg / l, with an average of 0. 01671 mg / l and 24 -hour LC 99 ranged from 0. 02856 - 0. 03852 mg / l with an average of 0. 03196 mg / l. This study showed that the larvae of Aedes aegypti in the district of West Banjarmasin are resistant to permethrin. As for pyriproksifen larvicides effectively killed larvae by 70 % after seven days of exposure, and for larvicidal with active methopren killed 50 % of larvae on the eighth day. This study shows that larviciding of IGR group can be an alternative in the area that has been declared resistant to abate as in the sub-district of West Banjarmasin...|$|E
40|$|Three organophosphorus compounds- malathion, folithion and temephos- and two {{synthetic}} pyrethroids- alphamethrin and deltamethrin- {{were used}} for monitoring the susceptibility status of larvae and adults of six vector mosquitoe species: Culex quinquefasciatus (Filariasis) and Aedes albopictus (Dengue) (both laboratory and field strains); laboratory strains of Aedes aegypti (Dengue), Anopheles slephensi and Anopheles culicifacies (Malaria), and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (Japanese encephalitis) in India. From the LC 50 values obtained for these insecticides, {{it was found that}} all mosquito species including the field strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus were highly susceptible Except for Cx. quinquefasciatus (field strain) against malathion, 100 % mortality was observed at the discriminating dosages recommended by World Health Organization. The residual effect of alphamethrin, deltamethrin, malathion and folithion at 25 mg (ai) /m² on different surfaces against six species of vector mosquitoes showed that alphamethrin was the most effective on all four treated surfaces (mud, plywood, cement and thatch). Nevertheless, residual efficacy lasted longer on thatch than on the other surfaces. Therefore, synthetic pyrethroids such as alphamethrin can be effectively employed in integrated vector control operations. Três compostos organo-fosforados - malation, folition e <b>temefos</b> -e dois piretroides sintéticos - alfametrina e deltametrina - foram usados para controlar o estado da susceptibilidade das larvas e adultos de seis mosquitos vetores na Índia. Foram utilizadas cepas de laboratório e área de Culex quinquefasciatus (filariasis) e Aedes albopictus (Dengue) e cepas de laboratório de Aedes aegypti (Dengue), Anopheles stephensi e Anopheles culicifacies (Malária) e Culex tritaenorhynchus (encefalite japonesa). Os valores de C 1 (50) obtidos para esses inseticidas mostram que todas as espécies incluindo as cepas de área foram muito susceptíveis. Nos mosquitos adultos das referidas espécies salvo na cepa da área de Culex quinquefasciatus com o malathion, observou-se 100 % da mortalidade às doses discriminatórias recomendadas pela Organização Mundial de Saúde. O efeito residual da alfametrina, deltametrina, malation e folition a 25 mg (ai) /m² em diversas superfícies contra seis espécies de mosquitos vetores evidenciou que a alfametrina foi a mais efetiva em todas as superfícies tratadas (argila, "plywood", cimento e palha) ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the present}} study was to verify the {{coexistence}} between Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus populations in municipalities of the States of Paraná and Santa Catarina with different urbanization profiles where dengue occurs and evaluate their susceptibility to the organophosphate temephos. METHODS: The number of eggs per ovitrap were counted and incubated for hatching to identify the species. Data analysis of the populations was conducted to determine randomness and aggregation, using the variance-to-mean ratio (index of dispersion). Susceptibility to temephos was evaluated by estimation of the resistance ratios RR 50 and RR 95. Aedes aegypti samples were compared with the population Rockefeller and Aedes albopictus samples were compared with a population from the State of Santa Catarina and with the Rockefeller population. RESULTS: Coexistence between Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and the aggregation of their eggs were observed at all the sites analyzed in the State of Paraná. CONCLUSIONS: All the Aedes aegypti populations from the State of Parana showed alteration in susceptibility status to the organophosphate temephos, revealing incipient resistance. Similarly, all the Aedes albopictus populations (States of Paraná and Santa Catarina) presented survival when exposed to the organophosphate temephos. INTRODUÇÃO: O presente estudo teve como objetivo verificar a coexistência de populações de Aedes aegypti e de Aedes albopictus em municípios do Estado do Paraná e Santa Catarina com diferentes formas de urbanização, onde ocorrem casos de dengue, e avaliar a susceptibilidade ao organofosforado temephos. MÉTODOS: O número de ovos por ovitrampa foram contados (sem distinguir a espécie) e colocados para eclosão e posterior identificação das espécies. A análise das populacões foi conduzida para determinar aleatoriedade e agregação usando a razão variância/média (índice de dispersão). A susceptibilidade ao temephos foi avaliada para determinar e estimar as razões de resistência RR 50 e RR 95. As amostras de Aedes aegypti, obtidas do Estado do Paraná, foram comparadas com a população Rockefeller e as amostras de Aedes albopictus foram comparadas com a população do Estado de Santa Catarina. RESULTADOS: Coexistência entre Aedes aegypti e Aedes albopictus, e a agregação de seus ovos foram observados em todos os locais analisados. CONCLUSÕES: Todas as populações de Aedes aegypti do Estado do Paraná demonstraram alteração no status de susceptibilidade ao organofosforado temephos, evidenciando resistência incipiente.
