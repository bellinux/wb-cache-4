It represents two major initiatives by the mayor: to promote cycling and to make the city greener. By supporting cycling as an alternate form of transportation, it will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and promote <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> cycling.|$|E

5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

25|$|In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's {{phenolic}} content {{falls under}} the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking. There is on-going study into <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.|$|E
25|$|Although {{numerous}} {{claims have}} been made for <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> green tea, human clinical research has not provided conclusive evidence of any effects.

Although the mean content of flavonoids and catechins in a cup of green tea is higher than that in the same volume of other food and drink items that are traditionally considered to promote health, flavonoids and catechins have no proven biological effect in humans.|$|E

Although the Lebanese cuisine has a recent popularity throughout the world, its history dates back to pre-biblical times.

Nowadays, Lebanese cuisine is known throughout the world, especially with the recent emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> Mediterranean cuisine.

In comparison to other Western countries, Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%), probably thanks to <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean diet. The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24.4% in 2000 but still slightly above the OECD average. Smoking in public places including bars, restaurants, night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005.

25|$|Decades before {{health and}} fitness began being {{promoted}} by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons, LaLanne was already widely recognized for publicly preaching <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> regular exercise and a good diet. He published numerous books on fitness and hosted the fitness television program The Jack LaLanne Show between 1953 and 1985. As early as 1936, at age 21, he opened one of the nation's first fitness gyms in Oakland, California, which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms bearing his name. One of his 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women, whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs. He invented a number of exercise machines, including the pulley and leg extension devices and the Smith machine. Besides producing his own series of videos, he coached the elderly and disabled not to forgo exercise, believing it {{would enable them to}} enhance their strength.|$|E
25|$|Spinach is {{packaged}} in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. Some packaged spinach {{is exposed to}} radiation to kill any harmful bacteria that {{may be on the}} leaves. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys; however, using radiation to sanitize spinach is of concern because it may deplete the leaves of their nutritional value. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service experimentally tested the concentrations of vitamins C, E, K, B9, and four carotenoids in packaged spinach following irradiation. They found with increasing level of irradiation, four nutrients showed little or no change. Those nutrients include vitamins B9, E, K, and the carotenoid neoxanthin. This study showed the irradiation of packaged spinach to have little or no change to the nutritional value of the crop, and <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> irradiating packed spinach to reduce harmful bacteria seem to outweigh the loss of nutrients.|$|E

Recent research indicates that infection transmission dynamics influence <b>the</b> public <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> water treatment interventions, although some risk assessments currently in use do not fully account for those dynamics. This chapter models <b>the</b> public <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> two interventions: improvements to centralized water treatment facilities, and localized point-of-use treatments {{in the homes of}} particularly susceptible individuals. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the best option is not as obvious as that suggested by an analysis that ignores infection dynamics suggests. Deterministic and stochastic dynamic systems models prove to be useful tools for assessing the dynamics of risk exposure...|$|R
