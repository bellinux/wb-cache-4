This paper presents three <b>traffic</b> <b>re-routing</b> strategies designed to be incorporated in a cost-effective and easily deployable vehicular traffic guidance system that reduces the effect of traffic congestions. This system collects real-time traffic data from vehicles and road-side sensors and computes proactive, individually-tailored re-routing guidance which is pushed to vehicles when signs of congestion are observed on their route. Extensive simulation results over two urban road networks show that all three strategies, namely multipath load balancing considering future vehicle positions (EBkSP), random multipath load balancing (RkSP), and dynamic shortest path (DSP), significantly decrease the average travel time. EBkSP is the best, with as much as 104 % improvement compared to the "no re-routing" baseline. Additionally, it lowers with 34 % the re-routing frequency {{compared to the other}} strategies.

This view is seriously incomplete; re-routing practices ultimately may favor monopolists.

(2) Gaming the ISP harms not only other carriers but typically also callers. (3) Proportional return creates distortions even without foreign gaming: it penalizes larger carriers; and because of it, callback from the US can reduce US welfare even when callback is motivated by "innocent" arbitrage. We present a simple linear-pricing alternative to the ISP that eliminates these distortions, yet benefits both countries. International Telecom, Termination Payments, Alliances...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCentralized {{solutions}} for vehicular <b>traffic</b> <b>re-routing</b> to alleviate congestion suffer from two intrinsic problems: scalability, {{as the central}} server has to perform intensive computation and communication with the vehicles in real-time; and privacy, as the drivers have to share their location {{as well as the}} origins and destinations of their trips with the server. This article proposes DIVERT, a distributed vehicular re-routing system for congestion avoidance. DIVERT offloads {{a large part of the}} re-routing computation at the vehicles, and thus, the re-routing process becomes practical in real-time. To take collaborative re-routing decisions, the vehicles exchange messages over vehicular ad hoc networks. DIVERT is a hybrid system because it still uses a server and Internet communication to determine an accurate global view of the traffic. In addition, DIVERT balances the user privacy with the re-routing effectiveness. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with a centralized system, the proposed hybrid system increases the user privacy by 92 percent on average. In terms of average travel time, DIVERT’s performance is slightly less than that of the centralized system, but it still achieves substantial gains compared to the no re-routing case. In addition, DIVERT reduces the CPU and network load on the server by 99. 99 and 95 percent, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Next {{generation}} optical networks {{will evolve}} from static to dynamically reconfigurable architectures {{to meet the}} increasing bandwidth and service requirements. The benefits of dynamically reconfigurable networks (improved operations, reduced footprint and cost) have introduced new challenges, in particular the need for complex management which has {{put pressure on the}} engineering rules and transmission margins. This has provided the main drive to develop new techniques for optical performance monitoring (OPM) without using optical-to-electrical-to-optical conversions. When considering impairments due to chromatic dispersion in dynamic networks, each channel will traverse a unique path through the network thus the channels arriving at the monitoring point will, in general, exhibit different amounts of residual dispersion. Therefore, in a dynamic network it is necessary to monitor all channels individually to quantify the degradation, without the requirement of knowing the data path history. The monitoring feature can be used in conjunction with a dispersion compensation device which can either be optical or electrical or used to trigger real-time alarms for <b>traffic</b> <b>re-routing.</b> The proposed OPM technique is based on RF spectrum analysis and used for simultaneous and independent monitoring of power, chromatic dispersion (CD), polarisation mode dispersion (PMD) and optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) in 40 Gbit/s multi 0 channel systems. An analytical model is developed to describe the monitoring technique which allows the prediction of the measurement range. The experimental results are given for group velocity dispersion (GVD), differential group delay (DGD) and OSNR measurements. This technique is based on electro-optic down-conversion that simultaneously down-converts multiple channels, sharing the cost of the key components over multiple channels and making it cost effective for multi-channel operation. The measurement range achieved with this method is equal to 4742 ± 100 ps/nm for GVD, 200 ± 4 ps for DGD and 25 ± 1 dB for OSNR. To the knowledge of the author, these dispersion monitoring ranges are the largest reported to date for the bit-rate of 40 Gbit/s with amplitude modulation formats. ...|$|E

40|$|Revitalization and Rehabilitation Project for SADDAR - KARACHI A {{research}} to formulate alternatives for Revitalization of Saddar and Rehabilitation of its Hawkers, Encroachers and Leased Markets. By Arif Hasan, Asiya Sadiq Polack, Christophe Polack Karachi’s Saddar, once {{the pride of}} the city, is now a mess and becoming worse day by day. It is congested and environmentally degraded. In an attempt to solve its problems, Architect Arif Hasan, Chairman of the Urban Resource Centre (URC), prepared a development plan for Saddar in 1986. The plan included partial pedestrianisation and the rehabilitation of hawkers. When the plan was presented to the hawkers, they rejected it outright as they considered it an attack on their livelihoods. In the mid-’ 90, the URC carried out surveys in an attempt to understand the sociology and economy of the Saddar hawkers. Based on this understanding a research has been carried out by architects Arif Hasan, Asiya Sadiq Polack, Christophe Polack and researchers Muhammad Jameel and Muhammad Nazeer, both of the URC. The outcome of the research is an analysis of Saddar’s degradation, documentation of the existing situation and proposals for a rehabilitation plan along with financial and institutional details for its implementation and sustainability. The study was carried out in consultation with Mr. Malik Zaheerul Islam Director of the Transport and Communication Department and other concerned government officials. An introduction of the ongoing work was made to the previous City Government (formerly known as KMC) in 2001 and in 2002 to the present Karachi city and Saddar town nazims. A more elaborate presentation will be made to them in the coming weeks. It is hoped that the study will help the city government in its attempts to overcome the problems of Karachi’s Saddar. Background to the area of Study Saddar Bazaar area was once considered to be the cultural hub of Karachi. It was the geographic, economic and socio-cultural centre of Karachi and it was cherished by the citizens for its exquisite architecture, environment and services. In the last 30 years the culture of Saddar and its environs has changed dramatically due to the influence of an enormous population increase and resultant growth of the city. Saddar being centrally located in Karachi has turned into the largest transit area, catering to thousands of buses, other public transport vehicles and the commuting population. Surveys on schoolchildren and policemen point out that the lead content in blood has reached alarming levels and many psychiatric ailments in the area have proven to be directly linked with noise and air pollution. Many of the residential buildings having retail shops on the ground floor have been replaced by godowns and storage spaces or are lived in by male day wage labourers. This has obviously changed the character of the streets from lively down town shopping to deserted and unfriendly at night. More then 3000 semi-permanent cabins, hawkers and vendors catering to the transit population have sprung up lining almost all the streets in Saddar. They are a product of the process in which the mafia, supported by corrupt officials, form a party to extort money from them. The hawkers and encroachers pay to middlemen, known as ‘beaters’. These beaters are in touch with the hawkers’ associations on daily basis for collecting the bribe money (bhatta) which is proportionate to the commercial value of the encroached piece of land. In turn for the ‘bhatta’ provided, they keep their eyes closed to the activities of the hawkers and encroachers. Operation clean-ups and regular evictions are carried out to help keep the status quo. There are no attempts to regularise the hawkers and encroachers as it means loosing an easy source of income. Moreover, due to Saddar’s new type of transit clientele, there is a genuine demand for hawkers and encroachers, which promotes their growth and interest in the area. Saddar, being the geographical centre of the city {{and in the absence of}} a ring road, became the place where the interchange of buses had to occur. According to a recent survey done by the former Traffic Engineering Bureau (TEB), approximately 3, 50, 000 buses, mini-buses and cars are entering and exiting Saddar daily, which is an increase of 40. 7 percent in the last 6 years. This excludes all other modes of transport such as, bicycles, motorbikes, donkey and horse driven carts. No proper bus terminal has been allocated or provided in Saddar although transporters have been requesting it for many years. The ad-hoc bus terminal near Empress Market is a result of this. Secondly, the bus drivers, being under the influence of the power which is exerted by their owners, pick up or drop passengers anywhere along their route, sometimes stopping in the street far from the curb disturbing traffic or causing accidents. Myths and realities concerning hawkers, vendors and encroachments The middle and lower income groups visiting Saddar have a cultural and economic need in them. Hawkers and vendors provide services as well as entertainment to the transit and shopping population. For the lower income people, shops hold very little attraction due to their formal nature and high prices. They visit Saddar primarily for shopping from the hawker’s or just for an outing. Saddar still offers more than shopping possibilities for its regular visitors. The cultural aspect of wandering and browsing through merchandise, leafing through a newspaper, sitting with a palmist, having the shoes polished add flavour to the trip made by a regular visitor. Standing and applauding the medicine man, who is selling to a large audience by putting on an act provides a source of entertainment as well as parallel medicine to the lower income groups. In addition, the large variety of cheap food items, available with hawkers, is an added attraction to the visitors. The labourers, shopkeepers and office employees working in Saddar or in transit also use these eateries for their daily afternoon meals Old hawkers are usually those, who have been working in Saddar for the past 2 to 3 generations. They occupy the first row along the footpaths by de-facto status. New hawkers and encroachers are often recent arrivals in Saddar, usually employed by the police and city government officials to run their businesses. They usually occupy the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th row on the streets on the basis of official support. There are many hawkers, encroachers and shopkeepers’ organisations working for the social welfare and security of their respective members. However, they are not technically equipped nor organised enough to hold talks for rehabilitation with the government. These organisations charge a fee of between Rs. 50 - 100 per month per member. This money is used to pay guards at night who watch over the parked carts or locked cabins. It is also used for paying the sweepers who manage the solid waste and sometimes it is given as a welfare loan to hawkers, encroachers and shopkeepers in need of financial assistance. Contrary to the popular belief that shopkeepers cannot coexist with hawkers, being their competitors, an informal working relationship has been discovered. Hawkers serve as a source of attraction for their potential clients. When people see a large number of other people in front of the shops they are attracted to the liveliness and activity. Secondly, hawkers often sell products of the shops, at a slightly lower price but sharing the profit with the shopkeepers. This, of course, with the exception of upmarket shops or service based institutions such as jewellers, banks and upmarket restaurants who would much rather get rid of any form of encroachment in front of their premises. It is also a misconception that hawkers and vendors contribute to the littering of Saddar with solid waste. Although, part generators of both organic and inorganic waste, solid waste collection and disposal at street level is well taken care of by hawkers’ associations, hawkers, encroachers and shop keepers of leased markets. It does not, in any way, add to the environmental degradation of Saddar. The heaps of garbage, which are usually seen lying around, are a result of bad management and disposal at area level by the city government. Extensive interviews have been held with hawkers, encroachers and leased markets as well as the shoppers they serve. 86 Percent of the shoppers buying from them is in transit and do not have the time to go into the shops. This is also why cross sections and main roads are most attractive for hawkers, as there, they are visible to the pedestrian traffic. The poverty level of hawkers, encroachers and shopkeepers is not as high as expected, however, being evicted several times a month is not contributing to the stability of the financially weak. At an average hawkers and encroachers earn a net income of Rs. 100 per day. The remaining earnings of Rs. 200 is spent on the purchase of goods, bribes, storage and security of carts, association fee’s, solid waste disposal and transport. As long as a bus interchange in Saddar will remain, the need for hawkers will remain as well. Being an active part of the economy of Karachi, hawkers and encroachers are interested in lease, permit or any type of legal document, which would grant them security of tenure. In July 2001, 20 hawkers belonging to the Preedy Hawkers’ association came together and applied to the KMC for regularisation and permits for a permanent cabin. Once the money was deposited they were allotted 20 cabins. The other members of the organisation were encouraged by this attempt and within 2 months, 3000 more hawkers had applied to the association for regularisation. However, no further rehabilitation could take place as after 14 th August 2001, KMC ceased to exist and the new City Government revoked the previous orders and evicted all of them by force without returning the payments. The hawkers showed resistance on which they were threatened and asked to pay bribes by some of the officials. The Hawkers associations have lost all trust in the government agencies but understand that there is no other way out. They are not technically equipped to neither make alternative plans for rehabilitation nor negotiate with the government. They request the City Government to issue the permit or lease in advance. The same goes for the construction of new shops and related services in appropriate areas, which should be handed over before vacating the existing ones. The negotiation over this demand and its acceptance would be essential in order to reinstate a sense of trust in the hawkers, encroachers and shop keepers of leased markets vis a vis the city government for the success of the proposed scheme. Legalizing the hawkers and encroachers will also give an opportunity to the City Government to have control on their number. Traffic Planning and Management is closely related to the hawkers phenomena and is a planning issue to be dealt with on city scale. Saddar being the geographic centre of Karachi and serving the main living and work areas, any change in it, affects the larger traffic patterns of the city and vice versa. Also the sheer number of people living and working in the city and its increase in the past 50 years play a crucial role on their movement pattern. No substantial improvement can be achieved in Saddar before larger issues on City scale have been solved or at least dealt with in a constructive way. The high potential given by professionals to the Northern Bye pass and the Karachi Circular Railway have never really been taken seriously by the various government agencies. A rationalisation of routes and interchanges through a revised bus routing plan on city scale together with the creation of inter and intra-bus terminals is needed in order to reduce the number of vehicles going through Saddar. If a revitalization of the Karachi Circular Railway could be achieved, a simple shuttle service, bicycle and pedestrian access would be needed to connect the Cantonment station to Empress market and Saddar. The major issue which arose out of the study was traffic rerouting as a priority to relieve Saddar from its traffic congestion, making its commuting patterns for the vehicles and pedestrians more efficient and safer. Although officially no public transport vehicle can be on the roads without an official permit, almost 50 percent of the public buses in Karachi do not have a valid permit and each year new buses are added to the numbers. Out of 2282 issued permits only 16 percent of the buses actually terminate in Saddar, while 84 percent of the buses and mini-buses of Karachi are using Saddar as a thoroughfare. With such concentration of transit population and transport, which has no direct interest in the upkeep of Saddar, the idea of Saddar, the traditional and cultural centre of the city seems a far-fetched dream. As a response, a set of ring roads is proposed by the study around Saddar which would help relieving Saddar of through traffic but also improve the commuting efficiency. A ring road for fast-moving cars has been proposed following Abdullah Haroon Road and Mansfield road. Street parking would still be allowed but would only be accessible through a service lane. Similarly, a ring road for fast-moving buses has been proposed along Dr. Daud Pota Road with a left turn on Preedy street and the street along the Students’ Byriani restaurant. To facilitate the segregation of through and local traffic the next step has been the provision of infrastructure catering to transit traffic in the form of a bus terminal which could be located on the site where the weekly Sunday Bazaar is currently held Increasing the number of charged parking places in Saddar and have it operated under the management of the city government would give more revenues than the present system of contractors. Presently approximately 2, 500 parking spaces are available in Saddar. After adopting the proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>re-routing</b> plan this could be increased to 3, 313 parking spaces which would mean a monthly revenue of Rs. 33, 13, 000 to the City Government. The total number of parking spaces required to revitalise retail shopping and make Saddar more accessible cannot only be accommodated in streets. It will also require the provision of single and multi-storied parking lots. In 1986, 32 potential sites for multi storied- parkings lots and bus terminals have been selected by the former Traffic Engineering Bureau but due to various reasons none of these have been implemented. Relocation of Hawkers, Encroachers and leased markets. In the absence of pedestrian areas in Saddar, thousands of pedestrians are forced to mix with the vehicular traffic (100, 000 pedestrians cross Preedy Street everyday). Because of the encroachments on the footpath these pedestrian have no other choice then to risk their lives on the streets. Therefore, pedestrian zones have been provided with vendor stalls to complement the two activities. An overall connection with the bus terminal and bus stops has been established. The proposed pedestrian areas consist of Bohri Bazaar and portions of Zaibunissa Street, Sharah-e-Iraq, Dr. Daud Pota Road and Preedy street (refer map for details). Additional to this, some of the leased markets will be relocated on the land reserved for the Preedy Street extension. This location has been chosen due its close vicinity to both the proposed bus terminal and Empress Market which on their turn form the main attraction for the transit population. The proposals of the study have suggested that a transparent process of rehabilitation will have to be held through dialogues, mobilisation of the stakeholders and incremental development. Only this can ensure that all spatial and socio-economic concerns are addressed and provide a more realistic platform for the revitalization of Saddar and the rehabilitation of its hawkers and encroachers.   Photo 1 : Traffic congestion on Mansfield Street Photo 2 : Traffic and hawkers on Preedy Street Photo 3 : Hawkers on Preedy Street Photo 4 : Condition of Preedy Street extension All photographs taken by Arif Hasan & Partners/URC Table 1 : List of Average Earning and Expenditures of Hawkers Earning	Expenditures	Net Income for House Hold p. d 	p. m.

The {{highways}} that run through these passes are important northwest-southeast lines of communication through the Alps. The Pyrhn highway has been nicknamed the Fremdarbeiterweg ("foreign workers' route") because millions of Gastarbeiter ("guest workers") in Germany use it {{to return to their}} homes in the Balkans and Turkey for vacation. Many Germans and northern Europeans also use it in the summer months to reach the Adriatic coast.

5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That <b>traffic</b> was <b>re-routed</b> via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|R
