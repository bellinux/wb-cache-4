[...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune." [...] Although stating that it was very cliche, a writer for Popjustice said that the song [...] "seems like a boundary-smashing avant garde curiosity when you put it alongside most other Hollywood Records output."

2500|$|Piece by Piece {{fulfilled}} the recording contract Clarkson had signed {{as part of}} winning American Idols first season in 2002 with 19 Recordings and RCA Records, making her a free agent and the first American Idol contestant to successfully complete the feat. In a report published by Billboard, it was stated that Clarkson was currently in early stages to directly sign a contract with RCA in contrast to her previous arrangement where 19 Recordings kept phonographic rights licensed to RCA. Despite RCA's advantage, Billboard argued that the Big Machine Label Group could be a serious contender following Clarkson's history with Clive Davis, RCA's former chief executive and Sony's current chief creative officer. Billboard also reported that Piece by Pieces debut {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 earned Clarkson a leverage, with one prominent talent manager saying: [...] "That's a good time to mention you're a free agent, when you have a No. 1 album." [...] Music industry analysts also divulged that compared to her previous contract with a US $500,000 (US $ adjusted for inflation) advance per album, Clarkson could receive up to US $1–3 million advance per album in a new term. However, Clarkson's manager, Narvel Blackstock, asserted that the probability of Clarkson re-signing with RCA was <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> In an interview with Billboard, RCA executives Peter Edge and Tom Corson stated that Clarkson had entered negotiations for directly signing a multi-album record contract with RCA. However, on June 24, 2016, Clarkson announced she had signed a long-term worldwide deal with Atlantic Records.|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the whole story, but someday I will <b>tell</b> it <b>to</b> you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|R
