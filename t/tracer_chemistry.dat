40|$|Our main {{objectives}} {{are derived from}} {{an awareness of the}} very important role modern nuclear medicine is playing, as expressed explicitly in the synonym in vivo biochemistry. Radiopharmaceuticals are the molecular probes used for the diagnosis and cure of disease. For full exploitation of its potential, this discipline of in vivo biochemistry requires great commitment to interdisciplinary research into tracers. The emphasis is on fundamentals on the molecular level, leading to new approaches in tracer design: the <b>tracer</b> <b>chemistry</b> and structure-biodistribution relationships. The goals imply exploiting technetium coordination chemistry. New classes of complexes of technetium or thenium, the convenient model nuclide for radioactive technetium, have been synthesized and characterized. Technetium has an intricate coordination chemistry that does not go well with the organic nature of biochemical substrates. One of the main achievements of the year was the successful approach to make complexes of technetium biochemically reactive by functionalization of a coordinate ligand. Functionalization is focused on two areas. The first is specific binding, as in ligand-receptor interactions. The second is enzymatic hydrolysis in the target or a nontarget. The studies also constitute a contribution to applied bio-inorganic chemistry. (orig.)

IGY 4 was first surveyed in 1957, so this repeat gives a 40 –year look at decadal variability in the North Atlantic from the eastern boundary regime via the junction of subtropical and subpolar gyres to the western boundary regime. Additional short sections were measured (a) midway between Cape Farewell and Denmark Strait, (b) across Denmark Strait and (c) from Iceland to Scotland in order (i) to assess the spatial variability of the western boundary regime up the east Greenland coast to Denmark Strait, (ii) to assess the exchange between the northern North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas, (iii) to create a large scale North Atlantic closed box for evaluation of the circulation, and (iv) to continue the long time series of Rockall Trough sections. Sections were measured with stations for CTD, LADCP and <b>tracer</b> <b>chemistry</b> (CFCs, oxygen, nutrients, CO 2). Continuous measurements of high precision position and heading navigation data were made; also of VM–ADCP, depth and TSG.

The extent of horizontal flow component {{and the response}} of drip water chemistry to recharge events were examined in the Moravian Karst (Czech Republic), while the character of water flow and its chemistry were studied in salt diapirs in southeastern part of the Zagros mountains (Iran). Under the conditions of well-developed epikarst, the horizontal flow component, defined as Hmax/T (Hmax = horizontal migration component, T - thickness of VZ) typically reaches values of 0. 1 - 0. 6 (Moravian and Slovenian Karst). However, in areas where epikarst was stripped off by glacial or human activity, the proportion of horizontal flow component is far greater (Hmax/T 1. 6 - 24).

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I explore various {{influences on}} the surface chemistry in the United States. The research is in three parts: (1) the influence of emissions from Asia on surface ozone mixing ratios in the US using a <b>tracer</b> <b>chemistry</b> scheme; (2) a diagnostic analysis of surface ozone chemistry simulations using a Global Climate Chemistry Model (GCCM) in the US; and (3) {{an examination of the}} changing freight transportation patterns and its influence on Black Carbon (BC) surface chemistry in the Midwestern and Northeastern US. For the first part, we find that the Asian influence on US surface ozone chemistry is maximum in the springtime and a minimum in the summertime. This springtime maximum is a result of a low, dispersed plume of Asian pollution entering the air space over North America in the springtime. In contrast, the plume of Asian pollution crosses North American air space in a tighter and higher plume and is inaccessible to surface dynamics which could impact surface ozone. For the second part, we find that overall the CESM CAM-Chem GCCM is capable of capturing many aspects of surface ozone chemistry in the US, especially in the Southeastern and Western US. However, biases result under different sets of paramaterizations in model configurations, which must be accounted for in interpretation of GCCM results, including: (1) a large positive ozone bias when a 26 -layer configuration is used and a reduced, but still positive, bias when a 56 -layer configuration is chosen; and (2) utilizing online meteorology performs as good as or better when simulated a variety of ozone metrics than a simulation using forced meteorology. In the third part find that although the overall demand for transportation is increasing due to globalization and a fragmentation of the production process, the increases in technological efficiencies and emission factor regulations have resulted in a regionally averaged leveling-off or decrease in BC emissions from 1977 - 2007. The fabricated metal and construction sectors, with generally heavy freight, dominate the emission of BC. Finally, increases in BC emissions in urban centers are increasing as they continue to develop into production and transportation nodes...|$|E

This work uses spaceborne observations made with the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System instrument on the Odin satellite to retrieve the near-global K layer for the first time. The satellite data (2004 to mid- 2013) are used to validate {{the implementation of a}} recently proposed potassium chemistry scheme in a whole atmosphere chemistry climate model, which provides a chemical basis for this semiannual seasonal behavior.

The published article is copyrighted by Taylor & Francis {{and can be found}} at: [URL] calcifiers as a plankton functional type (PFT) are a crucial part of the global carbon cycle, being responsible for much of the carbon export to the deep ocean entering via biological pathways. Deep ocean carbon export through calcifiers is controlled by physiological, ecological and biogeochemical factors. This paper describes the implementation of a calcifying phytoplankton PFT in the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model version 2. 9 (UVic ESCM), and mechanistic improvements to the representation of model carbon export (a full calcite <b>tracer,</b> carbonate <b>chemistry</b> dependent calcite dissolution rates, and a ballasting scheme). An iterative method for stabilising and tuning the biogeochemistry is furthermore described. The UVic ESCM now fills a niche in Earth system modelling that was previously unoccupied in that it is relatively inexpensive to run, yet resolves the complete Earth system carbon cycle including prognostic calcium carbonate and a separate phytoplankton calcifier PFT. The model is now well suited to test feedbacks between the carbonate and carbon cycles and the climate system as transient simulations. The described modifications improve the UVic ESCM’s mechanistic realism without compromising performance with respect to observed carbon and nutrient fluxes.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for identifying groundwater discharge chemistry and quantifying spatially distributed groundwater discharge into rivers based on longitudinal synoptic sampling and flow gauging of a river. The method is demonstrated using a 450 km reach of a tropical river in Australia. Results obtained from sampling for environmental tracers, major ions, and selected trace element chemistry {{were used to}} calibrate a steady state one-dimensional advective transport model of tracer distribution along the river. The model closely reproduced river discharge and environmental <b>tracer</b> and <b>chemistry</b> composition along the study length. It provided a detailed longitudinal profile of groundwater inflow chemistry and discharge rates, revealing that regional fractured mudstones in {{the central part of}} the catchment contributed up to 40 % of all groundwater discharge. Detailed analysis of model calibration errors and modeled/measured groundwater ion ratios elucidated that groundwater discharging in the top of the catchment is a mixture of local groundwater and bank storage return flow, making the method potentially useful to differentiate between local and regional sourced groundwater discharge. As the error in tracer concentration induced by a flow event applies equally to any conservative tracer, we show that major ion ratios can still be resolved with minimal error when river samples are collected during transient flow conditions. The ability of the method to infer groundwater inflow chemistry from longitudinal river sampling is particularly attractive in remote areas where access to groundwater is limited or not possible, and for identification of actual fluxes of salts and/or specific contaminant sources...|$|R

Understanding the chemical and physical evolution of the matter leading to the formation of protoplanetary disks is an important step for this. We provide some new clues to this long-standing problem using three-dimensional chemical simulations of the early phases of disk formation: we interfaced the full gas-grain chemical model Nautilus with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamic model RAMSES, for different configurations and intensities of magnetic field. Our results show that the chemical content (gas and ices) is globally conserved during the collapsing process, from the parent molecular cloud to the young disk surrounding the first Larson core.

Spectral line observations at sub-mm and far-infrared wavelengths provide information on the physics and chemistry of PDRs, and therefore help us to understand the impact of young massive stars on their surrounding interstellar medium.

Methyl nitrate was the dominant species during both campaigns accounting for on average {{about one third}} of the total measured alkyl nitrates. High mixing ratios (> 50 pptv) and variability of methyl nitrate were observed at the near urban site (TORCH 1) that were not seen at the rural site (TORCH 2) and which could not be explained by local photochemical production or direct emissions. The diurnal variation of methyl nitrate during TORCH 1 showed a morning maximum that would be consistent with nighttime chemistry followed by transport to the surface by boundary layer dynamics. Similarly, elevated morning mixing ratios were also observed during TORCH 2 although the magnitudes were much smaller. As a result, methyl nitrate could represent a <b>tracer</b> for nighttime <b>chemistry</b> seen at the ground the following day. At both campaigns, the dominant source of short chain alkyl nitrates and carbonyl precursor radicals (=C 4) were from decomposition of larger compounds.

40|$|Present {{and future}} {{changes to the}} ocean organic carbon and {{carbonate}} pumps are {{and will continue to}} affect ocean ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. In this thesis, the ocean organic and carbonate cycles are modelled with a variety of parameterisations and complexity and used to simulate both pre-industrial as well as future hypothetical states. The models produce similar pre-industrial states but very different transient behaviours. A simplistic Biogeochemistry-Ocean Model, the CSIRO-Mk 3 L, demonstrates a large future ocean saturation state sensitivity to enhanced organic carbon export and reduced carbonate export, though sedimentary carbonate compensation is not considered. A more complex Earth System Model, the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM), is improved with the inclusion of a calcifying phytoplankton functional type, a full calcite <b>tracer,</b> carbonate <b>chemistry</b> dependent calcite dissolution rates, and a ballasting scheme. These modifications slightly improve UVic ESCM performance with respect to observed carbon and nutrient fluxes and greatly improve the mechanistic realism of the model. Addition of a carbonate chemistry dependency on calcifier microbial recycling rates improves calcifier biogeography, but produces mixed results with respect to observed carbon and nutrient fluxes. Greenhouse gas forcing of four variations of the UVic ESCM (1 : without calcifiers, 2 : with calcifiers, 3 : with calcifiers and prognostic CaCO 3, and 4 : with calcifiers, prognostic CaCO 3, and chemistry-dependent calcifier microbial recycling) show a common response of a transition between two globally dominant biogeochemical feedbacks. The first is a physically driven one that dominates at lower changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and is sensitive to phytoplankton community composition. The second dominant feedback is biologically driven and overtakes the first at higher SST changes. The deep ocean carbon export and oxygen response is found to be highly sensitive to the inclusion of a prognostic calcite tracer for higher SST changes under this second dominant feedback. This thesis underscores the importance of accurate representation of phytoplankton physiology and ecology in climate models, as well as inclusion of prognostic calcite that accounts for organic carbon ballasting. It also highlights the potentially under-appreciated role of microbial processes under both ocean warming and acidification...|$|R

The detection of the hydrocarbons c-C 3 H 2 and CH 3 C 2 G ∼ 104 H 0 in the nucleus of M 82 suggests that a complex carbon chemistry is developing in this giant PDR.

The existing national facilities are at OVRO, the 12 -meter at Kitt Peak, UC array at Hat Creek, the Caltech CSO on Mauna Kea, and the 14 -meter at the Univ. of Massachusetts, near Amherst. The group used {{all of these}} instruments {{in the last year}} except the Univ. of Massachusetts 14 -meter. This wavelength range (0. 3 to 3 mm) is about to enjoy an explosion of interest as submillimeter receivers become better and easier to use. This region of the spectrum is rich in transitions of molecules that exist in the planetary atmospheres which can be studied for temperature-pressure profiles, wind <b>tracers,</b> and atmospheric <b>chemistry.</b> The list of solar system objects that have been recently addressed with these techniques include: (1) Venus: CO studies of T-P profiles, winds, and photochemistry; SO 2 detections; Continuum mapping remains to be done at 1 mm; (2) Earth H 2 O, CO, NO, NO 2, O(18) O, etc. as a test bed for other atmospheres; (3) Mars: H 2 O, CO, O(18) O studies of T-P profiles, winds (fall of 1990), and photochemistry; (4) Saturn: Same as Jupiter plus submillimeter and millimeter mapping of the ring system; (5) Uranus and Neptune: Continuum thermal mapping; and (6) Titan: CO, HCN, and HC 3 NT-P information and photochemistry.

40|$|Megacities, with a {{population}} exceeding ten million inhabitants, represent hot spots of emissions {{that need to be}} correctly quantified in order to evaluate their effects at the local, regional and global scale. Within the 7 th Framework European project CityZen (Megacity - Zoom for the Environment), the impact of changes in emissions on the global distributions of chemical compounds is being assessed, with a focus on the impact of megacities in Europe, Northern Africa and China. The goal of the project is to comprehend the feedbacks between climate change and air quality from the largest world cities at the global and regional scales. In order to simulate the changes in the distribution of gaseous compounds as well as aerosols we have used the MOZART (Model for OZone And Related chemical <b>Tracers)</b> global <b>chemistry</b> transport model. This model is driven by offline meteorological fields: for the present study we have used the meteorological fields provided by the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The focus of the study is the 1996 - 2007 period, during which the changes in the distribution of the chemical compounds related to changes in emissions during that period will be discussed. The global emissions {{used in the present study}} are derived from the new dataset developed in support of the next IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) AR 5 report under discussion. We will discuss the methodology we have used to update the IPCC anthropogenic emissions up to year 2007. The new emissions inventory for Europe developed within CityZen for the 1996 - 2007 period will be discussed and compared with the emissions provided by other inventories. Furthermore, we will discuss the biomass burning inventory used in this work, which provides monthly averaged emissions for the full period of the study. Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds are derived from the most recent version of the MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) model. Simulations covering the considered period will be performed using different combinations of the emissions of the datasets being performed. We will discuss the results of the simulations, focusing more particularly on the simulations using either IPCC dataset or a combined IPCC / European emissions dataset, or different Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds emissions. We will discuss the changes in the distribution of tropospheric chemical species from the different simulations, considering both gaseous compounds and different types of aerosols...|$|R
40|$|The coastal aquifer of Bou-Areg (Morocco) {{has been}} studied to {{identify}} the main processes causing groundwater salinization, using a multi <b>tracer</b> (general <b>chemistry</b> and isotopes - delta H- 2, delta O- 18, delta C- 13, delta N- 15 (NO 3), delta O- 18 (NO 3)) geochemical approach. Groundwater {{is characterized by the}} widespread occurrence of brackish waters (TDS < 500 mg L- 1) with high cation contents, which are balanced by elevated dissolved NO 3 - (reaching a maximum of 208 mg L- 1) and Cl-. Lagoon samples represent a mixture of fresh water and sea water, showing a Na/Cl ratio in agreement with that of sea water and an excess of Ca. The high Ca values represent the main peculiarity of the groundwater-lagoon water system. Two types of groundwater could be identified: (i) freshwater, separated from the whole system and located at the limit of the irrigated area, characterized by low TDS, depleted isotopic composition and relatively high quality; and (ii) water mainly recharged by mountain runoff, interacting with local recharge and acquiring salinity from different sources, thus creating a complex system of dilute waters. Hydrochemical results confirm that the high salinity of the aquifer is caused by the coexistence of dissolution of evaporate rocks and carbonates from Miocene strata, water-rock interaction, and human impacts due to agricultural return flows. The latter represents the main contribution to groundwater salinization, especially in {{the central part of the}} aquifer, as well as one of the main causes of the general increase in NO 3 - concentrations. Only locally, in the southern part of the aquifer, close to the city of Kariat Arkmane, the high salinization observed may be attributed to the presence of lagoon water intrusion. The isotopic composition of dissolved NO 3 - indicates manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas and in the central part of the plain, and synthetic fertilizers in the agricultural zone as the main drivers for human induced pollution. The study shows that agricultural return flow has significantly modified the chemistry of the system and it is a prime example of the human-induced changes over coastal environments. Saline water intrusion from the lagoon in the shallow aquifer is negligible, while discharge of polluted groundwater into the lagoon has been found to partially alter its qualit...|$|R

The system includes tracers representing biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions from different geographical emissions source regions, as well as air mass age indicators. We demonstrate how this forecasting system was used in flight planning and {{in the interpretation of}} the experimental data obtained through the case study of the summer mission ARCTAS DC- 8 flight executed on July 9 2008 that sampled near the North Pole. The comparison of predicted meteorological variables including temperature, pressure, wind speed and wind direction against the flight observations shows that the WRF model is able to correctly describe the synoptic circulation and cloud coverage in the Arctic region The absolute values of predicted CO match the measured CO closely suggesting that the STEM model is able to capture the variability in observations within the Arctic region. The time–altitude cross sections of source region tagged CO tracers along the flight track helped in identifying biomass burning (from North Asia) and anthropogenic (largely China) as major sources contributing to the observed CO along this flight. The difference between forecast and post analysis biomass burning emissions can lead to significant changes (∼ 10 – 50 %) in primary CO predictions reflecting the large uncertainty associated with biomass burning estimates and the need to reduce this uncertainty for effective flight planning...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify environmental <b>tracers</b> using water <b>chemistry</b> and stable isotopes in the Moulton Road area adjacent to the Yankee Doodle tailings impoundment north of Butte, Montana. The water level of the tailings lake is being raised as tailings slurry is pumped up to the impoundment, and numerous residential wells are located in close proximity. Although it has an alkaline pH (3 ̆e 9), the water in the tailings lake is much higher in some chemical constituents than the wells and some of these constituents could be used as tracers to determine if lake water is migrating out of the impoundment due to the rising level. Tracers examined in this study include the O- and H-isotopic composition of water and the concentration and S- and Oisotopic compositions of dissolved sulfate. Although water in the tailings lake is partly evaporated, the contrast between the isotopic signature of the lake and the groundwater wells is relatively small, making it a less powerful tracer. On the other hand, sulfate concentrations are more than an order of magnitude higher in the lake than in the groundwater. Whereas the Sisotope compositions of dissolved sulfate in lake and groundwater samples are similar, the Oisotope compositions of sulfate for the two end members are very different (- 2. 8 and - 14. 0 ‰, respectively). A conservative mass balance model was used to predict changes in the concentration and isotopic composition of sulfate in background groundwater as water sourced from the tailings lake is mixed in.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} element exists {{naturally in}} the form of three isotopes, sharing the same number of proton and electron, which is equal to one, but not that of neutrons, which ranges from zero to two. In order, these isotopes are: protium, commonly said light hydrogen and indicated with (_ 1 ^ 1) H or simply H; deuterium, commonly heavy hydrogen indicated with (_ 1 ^ 2) H or D; and tritium, (_ 1 ^ 3) H or T. Naturally, deuterium abundance is 0. 0115 per cent, while tritium is rare and radioactively unstable. Protium, deuterium and tritium form diatomic molecules bonding together, which can be homonuclear, H_ 2, D_ 2 and T_ 2, or heteronuclear, HD, HT and DT. Homonuclear molecules can exists in either a ortho modification, oH_ 2, oD_ 2, oT_ 2, or a para modification, pH_ 2, pD_ 2, pT_ 2. Hydrogen has the largest isotope effects principally due to the largest differences in the relative mass of its isotopes. Isotope effects are differences in chemical and physical properties arising from differences in the nuclear mass. In particular, lighter hydrogen molecules are characterized by higher vapour pressures than heavier ones; in other words, lighter molecules are more volatile. Among the isotope separation techniques, distillation is adopted in industrial applications because of the advantages of achieving high separation degrees and of processing large quantities of fluids. Distillation is based on the different vapour pressures of the components to be separate and, hence, it requires the coexistence of liquid and vapour phases. Coexistence occurs in the cryogenic range 10 - 40 K for molecular hydrogen. The number of cryogenic distillation plants constructed for deuterium and tritium separation is small due to their limited market. One example is the deuterium plant built in Germany in the late 1960 s, and another the tritium plant in Canada in late 1980 s. Both plants proved the possibility to achieve high purities, exceeding 99. 8 per cent, as well as high separation factors. Today, deuterium is employed mostly as constituent of heavy water as neutron moderator for a number of nuclear fission reactors; it is also utilized for the preparation of nuclear weapons or as a non-radioactive tracer in chemical and metabolic reactions. Tritium is used instead as a radioactive <b>tracer</b> in <b>chemistry</b> and biology. Both deuterium and tritium are adopted for the research on the physics of matter and, notably, they have been selected for the future ITER nuclear fusion reactor...|$|R
40|$|Metal-poor {{stars in}} the Milky Way are local relics of the epoch of the first stars and the first galaxies. However, a low {{metallicity}} does not prove that a star formed in this ancient era, as metal-poor stars form over a range of redshift in different environments. Theoretical models of Milky Way formation have shown that at constant metallicity, the oldest stars are those closest {{to the center of}} the Galaxy on the most tightly bound orbits. For that reason, the most metal-poor {{stars in the}} bulge of the Milky Way provide excellent <b>tracers</b> of the <b>chemistry</b> of the high-redshift universe. We report the dynamics and detailed chemical abundances of three stars in the bulge with [Fe/H] ≲ - 2. 7, two of which are the most metal-poor stars in the bulge in the literature. We find that with the exception of scandium, all three stars follow the abundance trends identified previously for metal-poor halo stars. These three stars have the lowest [Sc ii/Fe] abundances yet seen in α-enhanced giant stars in the Galaxy. Moreover, all three stars are outliers in the otherwise tight [Sc ii/Fe]–[Ti ii/Fe] relation observed among metal-poor halo stars. Theoretical models predict that there is a 30 % chance that at least one of these stars formed at z ≳ 15, while there is a 70 % chance that at least one formed at 10 ≲ z ≲ 15. These observations imply that by z ~ 10, the progenitor galaxies of the Milky Way had both reached [Fe/H] ~ - 3. 0 and established the abundance pattern observed in extremely metal-poor stars.

40|$|International audienceThe {{origin of}} {{chemically}} and isotopically enriched basalts along mid-ocean ridges (E-MORB) {{has been the}} subject of recent interest, particularly in cases where they are not related to a specific mantle plume. We present new isotope dilution analyses for Th, U, La, Ce, and Pb in 26 mostly glassy tholeiite samples dredged from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) between 10 ° and 24 °N. We interpret these data in combination with other previously published trace element data and isotope ratios for the same samples. We focus on the region at 14 °– 15 °N, where incompatible trace element abundances are enriched by as much as factors of 40, relative to the depleted basalts found to the north and the south of this region. We invoke simple recycling of alkali basalts found on oceanic islands and seamounts as an alternative E-MORB origin to a recently published metasomatic enrichment model. A small amount of recycled alkali basalt is added to the local depleted mantle peridotite. Melting of such mixed sources can produce the observed E-MORB at 14 °– 15 °N MAR and elsewhere. The bulk partition coefficients of Nb, Ta, K, and Pb (relative to other trace elements) are geochemically important because these elements are widely used as <b>tracers</b> of source <b>chemistry.</b> We evaluate their partitioning using simple log-log plots, and we compare the 10 °– 24 ° MAR basalts with a similar suite from the CIR 18 °– 20 °S. In both suites, Nb (bulk) partitioning is close to Th, and Pb is close to Pr. Tantalum partitioning is also very close to Nb in the MAR setting but between U and K in the CIR setting. Potassium is slightly more compatible than U in the MAR suite but less compatible in the CIR setting. Thus, although the bulk partition coefficients of these elements do vary slightly in different regions, their overall consistency is remarkable considering that the partitioning of the individual elements is governed by different mineral phases...|$|R
