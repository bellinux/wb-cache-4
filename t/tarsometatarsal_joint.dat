2500|$|Anaesthesia of an {{affected}} joint {{is a more}} definitive way of {{confirming the}} presence of pain arising from that joint. Introduction of local anaesthetic into a joint should abolish or at least significantly lessen the lameness. [...] This technique is not absolutely specific, as the distal pouches of the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> are immediately adjacent to the suspensory ligament. This means that anaesthetic in the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> can occasionally desensitize pain arising from suspensory ligament, giving the false impression that joint pain has been abolished.|$|E
50|$|Other {{proximal}} fifth metatarsal fractures exist, {{although they}} are not as severe as a Jones fracture. If the fracture enters the intermetatarsal joint, it is a Jones fracture. If, however, it enters the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> then it is an avulsion fracture caused by pull from the peroneus brevis. An avulsion fracture is sometimes called a Pseudo-Jones fracture or a Dancer's fracture.|$|E
50|$|Peroneal group: peroneus longus arises on the {{proximal}} {{aspect of the}} fibula and peroneus brevis below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral malleolus. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> while peroneus brevis reaches {{the proximal}} part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.|$|E

50|$|Extensor group: tibialis {{anterior}} originates on {{the proximal}} {{half of the}} tibia and the interosseous membrane and is inserted near the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> of the first digit. In the non-weight-bearing leg tibialis anterior flexes the foot dorsally and lift its medial edge (supination). In the weight-bearing leg it brings the leg towards {{the back of the}} foot, like in rapid walking. Extensor digitorum longus arises on the lateral tibial condyle and along the fibula to be inserted on the second to fifth digits and proximally on the fifth metatarsal. The extensor digitorum longus acts similar to the tibialis anterior except that it also dorsiflexes the digits. Extensor hallucis longus originates medially on the fibula and is inserted on the first digit. As the name implies it dorsiflexes the big toe and also acts on the ankle in the unstressed leg. In the weight-bearing leg it acts similar to the tibialis anterior.|$|E

30|$|Soft tissue {{releases}} {{were always}} performed using loops magnification (× 4.5). An extended posteromedial incision was used, often {{in line with}} a previous posteromedial incision.

The Achilles tendon was approached medially and in most cases, scaring was present between the Achilles tendon sheath and Achilles tendon itself. Posterior and medial dissection allowed visualization of the posteromedial aspects of the ankle joint, subtalar joint, and the medial and plantar and dorsal aspect of the talonavicular, navicular-cuneiforn and first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints.</b> Complete release by capsulotomies of the ankle, subtalar, talonavicular and first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> until mobilization of the ankle, hindfoot, and midfoot was obtained. In all cases, irrespective of the presence of a cavus deformity, a plantar fascia release was performed near its origin. Flexor digitorum brevis and hallux abductus muscles were also released from their proximal insertions to allow forefoot correction. The ankle joint posterior capsule release was necessary to correct hindfoot equinus. Medial releases were used to correct varus of the hindfoot and adduction of the midfoot. Calcaneocuboid release was used in two cases to realign the lateral border of the foot. After the release had been completed, the foot and the ankle were partially corrected and the Achilles, TP, FHL and FDL tendons were lengthened and repaired.|$|R

5000|$|The human foot has two {{longitudinal}} arches and a transverse arch {{maintained by}} the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity.
