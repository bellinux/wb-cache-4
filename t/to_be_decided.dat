5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up {{now for the first}} time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> by this Court, we consider it as having been long since settled in public opinion.

5|$|In 1947, a {{trusteeship}} {{was established}} by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees. Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia and New Zealand were a joint administering authority.

However, in practice, administrative power was exercised by Australia alone.|$|E

5|$|After {{seeing the}} {{preliminary}} pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers {{realized there was}} no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided,</b> Knauf contested plans to make him a Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> by the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. President of the DPJ, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the route}} that {{eventually}} became the Victoria line {{date from the}} 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking north-east London with the centre {{was included in the}} County of London Plan in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and north or north-east London. Each of these connected the three main line termini at King's Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962.|$|E

QPR were appearing in their first final, while Albion were appearing in their second after winning the previous final in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Toronto went five games, but is {{remarkable}} as each game required overtime <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided.</b> In the third game, with the series tied at one game a piece, Kennedy both saved {{the game for}} the Leafs and won it. First, he prevented a goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net, then, just fifty seconds later {{at the other end}} of the rink, he intercepted a clear-out pass from Montreal's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game. The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.|$|E

5|$|A {{proposal}} for a new underground railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party {{set up by the}} British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. Cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.|$|E

On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of the}} House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public {{a referendum on the}} original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> by referendum.|$|E
