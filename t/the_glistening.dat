500|$|Sound {{effects were}} {{generated}} {{with a variety}} of sources including Pop Rocks—a brand of popping candy—and a parrot. <b>The</b> <b>glistening</b> ice forming on the stone cylinders discovered in the film was created by applying the popping candy to materials such as wet metal and stone that was then sprayed with water to produce the [...] "popping, cracking" [...] sound. Sound designer Ann Scibelli's parrot was recorded over several weeks to document her variety of vocalizations which were then used as beeps, alarms and the cries of Shaw's alien offspring.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes nicknamed El-Behdja (البهجة) or {{alternatively}} Alger la Blanche ("Algiers the White") for <b>the</b> <b>glistening</b> white of its buildings as seen rising {{up from the}} sea, Algiers is situated {{on the west side}} of a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, [...] above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.|$|E
2500|$|The protagonists of Kracht's fiction {{embark on}} {{journeys}} that {{take them in}} search of an elusive moment of immersive, utopian experience or spiritual enlightenment often located in a different nation or culture. Their journey usually, but not always, results in disappointment, failure or even death. The theme of travel was introduced in Kracht's debut novel Faserland (1995), a text that is often central in the discussion of German pop literature by literary critics and scholars. While the first wave of the novel's criticism identified Faserland as a novel about the affirmation of brand names and consumer culture, a second wave of criticism suggested rather that the novels evinces the protagonist's dissatisfaction with his lifestyle and existential [...] "ennui". Early criticism of the novel suggested the influence of Bret Easton Ellis on his work, with some commentators even accusing him of plagiarism. Since the critical revaluation of Faserland, however, critics have observed the potential influence of the novel on in work by younger German-language writers such as Leif Randt in his 2011 novel Schimmernder Dunst über Coby County (<b>The</b> <b>glistening</b> haze over Coby County).|$|E

2500|$|In-hye {{remains the}} only member of the family to support Yeong-hye after her mental and {{physical}} decline. She has separated from her husband after the events of the previous section, and is left to take care of their son in addition to her deteriorating sister. As Yeong-hye's behavior worsens, she is admitted to a mental hospital at Mount Ch'ukseong, where, despite receiving high-level treatment for mania, she behaves gradually more plant-like. One one occasion she escapes the hospital and is found standing in a forest [...] "soaked with rain as if she herself were one of <b>the</b> <b>glistening</b> trees." [...] In-hye, who constantly ruminates about the pain of dealing with her divorce and the care of her child and who throughout the chapter shows signs of her own depression and mental instability, visits Yeong-hye regularly and continues to try to get her to eat. Yeong-hye has given up food altogether, and when In-hye witnesses the doctors force-feeding her and threatening sedation to prevent vomiting, In-hye bites the nurse holding her back and grabs her sister. In-hye takes Yeong-hye to a different hospital by train, and observes the trees pass by.|$|E
2500|$|About {{three days}} after the egg is laid, the free end of the egg becomes glassy white. The grub chews its way out with its tiny dark-tipped mandibles. Eventually, the eggshell splits, {{revealing}} <b>the</b> <b>glistening,</b> white, footless grub. The grub, still attached to the host tarantula by its tail end, arches over and digs into the tarantula’s skin, creating a perforation aided by a dissolving fluid. Now that the grub is firmly attached by both its tail and head to the tarantula, it begins to suck the juices out of the tarantula’s body. As it feeds, the larva grows, rapidly engorging itself on the tarantula and darkening in color. As it grows, it molts several times, casting off its head capsule and body skin. After each molt, it resumes feeding, often through a new perforation. By the fourth instar, the tarantula’s abdomen has collapsed slightly. At the fifth and last instar, the larva has developed a pair of stout three-toothed mandibles in order to keep up with its feeding habits. The larva has become muscular and mobile by this stage. [...] It will cut a hole into the tarantula’s carapace and thrust its head and thorax inside the host spider, continuing to feed ravenously. As it feeds, it hollows out the tarantula, up to the bases of the spider’s hairy legs. [...] At the beginning of this invasive assault, the tarantula finally expires. This entire process from egg to fifth instar takes around 35 days total.|$|E
