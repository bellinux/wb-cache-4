5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge.</b> If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... <b>To</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E

25|$|In his 1997 {{submission}} to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, General Malan described the CCB as follows:"15.1 Let me now {{deal with the}} matter of the CCB. The CCB-organisation as a component of Special Forces was approved in principle by me. Special Forces was an integral and supportive part of the South African Defence Force. The role envisaged for the CCB was the infiltration and penetration of the enemy, the gathering of information and the disruption of the enemy. The CCB was approved as an organisation consisting of ten divisions, or as expressed in military jargon, regions. Eight of these divisions or regions were intended to refer to geographical areas. The area of one of these regions, Region Six, referred to the Republic of South Africa. The fact that the organisation in Region Six was activated, came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{for the first time in}} November 1989. The CCB provided the South African Defence Force with good covert capabilities.|$|E
25|$|If {{the law is}} made as it {{now stands}} respectable {{families}} in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be {{denied the right to}} intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge.</b> They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{introduces}} the character Michonne, a protagonist in the comic {{series of the}} same name who is portrayed by Danai Gurira. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale. Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme. Rutina Wesley, who played Tara Thornton in True Blood, was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process. [...] "It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't know that she was even available; I think she's still on True Blood. I don't know where that rumor came from, but <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> she was never involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised {{me to get a}} little Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>Knowledge,</b> all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time.

[...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E

500|$|Throughout her life, Emma Smith {{frequently}} {{denied that}} her husband had ever taken additional wives. Emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to Smith by Mormons was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's periodical The Seer in 1853. Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy, and was the main signatory of a petition in 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy, and denying her husband as its creator or participant. Even on her deathbed, Emma denied Joseph's involvement with polygamy, stating, [...] "No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of... He had no other wife but me; nor did he <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> ever have".|$|E
500|$|... "Machinery {{was made}} for {{manufacturing}} percussion caps and small arms, and both were turned out in small quantity, but of excellent quality. Lead mines were opened and worked, and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the Ordnance Department and {{in the manufacture of}} calomel, castor oil, spirits of nitre, the various tinctures of iron, and other valuable medicines. Most of these works were located at or near Arkadelphia on the Ouachita River, 75 miles south from Little Rock. The tools, machinery, and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor. Nothing of this sort had been before attempted on Government account in Arkansas <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> except for the manufacture of small arms, the machinery for which was taken away by General Van Dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings� A further supply, along with lead and caps, was procured from the citizens of Little Rock and vicinity by donation, purchases, and impressments.|$|E
500|$|In March 1897 {{as members}} of the Household {{prepared}} to depart for Cimiez for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When Harriet Phipps, one of the Queen's maids of honour, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by [...] "race prejudice" [...] and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought [...] "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, [...] " [...] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can." [...] Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were [...] "Respectable and trustworthy... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded [...] "the Munshi has done nothing <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture... enquiries wd not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." [...] He did, however, authorise further investigation of the [...] "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed, who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was [...] "to put him [...] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".|$|E

500|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} aircraft were {{submitted to the}} BuAer and Grumman for study in 1942. The U.S. carrier-borne fighter plane that succeeded the Grumman [...] F4F Wildcat, the F6F, would be tested in its first experimental mode as the XF6F-1 prototype with an under-powered Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone 14-cylinder, two-row radial engine on 26 June 1942. Shortly before the XF6F-1's first flight, and based on combat accounts of encounters between the F4F Wildcat and A6M Zero, on 26 April 1942, BuAer directed Grumman to install the more powerful 18-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engine— already powering Chance Vought's Corsair design since its beginnings in 1940— in the second XF6F-1 prototype. Grumman complied by redesigning and strengthening the F6F airframe to incorporate the 2,000hp (1,500kW) R-2800-10 engine, driving a three-bladed Hamilton Standard propeller. With this combination Grumman estimated the XF6F-3's performance would increase by 25% over that of the XF6F-1. This first Double Wasp-equipped Hellcat airframe, bearing BuAer serial number 02982, first flew on 30 July 1942. [...] The F6F-3 subtype had been designed with specific [...] "Wildcat vs Zero" [...] input from Battle of the Coral Sea and Battle of Midway veteran F4F pilots such as Jim Flatley and Jimmy Thach, respectively, among several others, obtained during a meeting with Grumman Vice President Jake Swirbul at Pearl Harbor on 23 June 1942, with the first production F6F-3 making its first flight just over three months later, on October 3, 1942. While the captured Zero's tests did not drastically influence the Hellcat's design, they did give knowledge of the Zero's handling characteristics, including its limitations in rolling right and diving. That information, together with the improved capabilities of the Hellcat, were credited with helping American pilots [...] "tip the balance in the Pacific". American aces Kenneth A. Walsh and R. Robert Porter, among others, credited tactics derived from this knowledge with saving their lives. James Sargent Russell, who commanded the PBY Catalina squadron that discovered the Zero and later rose {{to the rank of}} admiral, noted that Koga's Zero was [...] "of tremendous historical significance." [...] William N. Leonard concurred, describing it thus: [...] "The captured Zero was a treasure. <b>To</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> no other captured machine has ever unlocked so many secrets {{at a time when the}} need was so great." ...|$|E
