5000|$|Adding {{a fourth}} {{transistor}} to the Wilson current mirror as in Fig. 4a equalizes the collector voltages of Q1 and Q2 {{by lowering the}} collector voltage of Q1 by an amount equal to VBE4. This has three effects: first, it removes any mismatch between Q1 and Q2 due to the Early effect in Q1. This is the only first order source of mismatch in the three-transistor Wilson current mirror Second, at high currents the current gain, , of transistors decreases and the relation of collector current to base-emitter voltage deviates from [...] The severity of these effects depends on the collector voltage. By forcing a match between the collector voltages of Q1 and Q2, the circuit makes the performance degradation at high current on the input and output branches symmetric. This extends the linear operating range of the circuit substantially. In one reported measurement on a circuit implemented with a <b>transistor</b> <b>array</b> for an application requiring 10 mA output, {{the addition of the}} fourth transistor extended the operating current for which the circuit showed less than 1 percent difference between input and output currents by at least a factor of two over the three transistor version.|$|E

The memory transistors have remnant current modulations of ∼ 105 with a retention time of more than 12 days. They can be switched in less than 1 μs at operating voltages of 25 V. Switching speed is strongly decreased with decreasing voltage: at ∼ 10 V the transistors do not switch within 10 s. This difference in switching speed of more than 4 orders in magnitude when changing the electric field {{by a factor of}} only 2. 5 makes these memories robust towards disturb voltages, and forms the basis of integration of these transistors in passive matrix-addressable <b>transistor</b> <b>arrays</b> that contains only one (memory) transistor per cell.
