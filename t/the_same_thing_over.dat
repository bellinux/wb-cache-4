25|$|According to Yuji Horii, {{he wanted}} to have {{something}} the player went around collecting as the previous Dragon Quest games had crests and orbs respectively. However, {{he did not want to}} do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game. The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist Akira Toriyama, whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|In 1819 Passez {{offered to}} make Balzac his successor, but his {{apprentice}} {{had had enough}} of the Law. He despaired of being [...] "a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over again.... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.|$|E

Dishwashing almost drives me crazy." ...|$|R
50|$|Is there {{anything}} new I {{can say to}} express my love for you? No, sweet boy, there is nothing, but I must say <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> again, like prayers to God, {{in order to keep}} eternal love fresh. The agedness of love disappears as it looks back to when it was first created, even though the passage of time would suggest it should by now have died.|$|R
500|$|Grand Theft Auto Vs {{multiple}} protagonist {{design was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} series core mechanics. The team sought to innovate game storytelling and negate stale familiarity by not evolving the gameplay's core structure. [...] "We didn't want to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again", said Houser. The multiple protagonist idea was first raised during San Andreas development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible. Garbut explained, [...] "It didn't work from a tech point of view because the three characters need {{three times as much}} memory, three types of animation, and so on". After Grand Theft Auto IVs release, the team developed [...] and , episodic content packages that followed new protagonists. The three interwoven stories received positive remarks, so the team structured Grand Theft Auto V around this model.|$|E
2500|$|Between them, Homme and Oliveri had {{different}} {{opinions on the}} usage of fake radio excerpts between tracks on the album, the former believing it gave the album [...] "fluidity". According to Oliveri, they are a jibe at [...] "how a lot of stations play <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over. We don't get played on the radio, so I figure we should talk shit about them." ...|$|E
2500|$|NMEs Emily MacKay {{described}} The Fame Monster [...] "as pristine as you'd expect, {{but has a}} sub-zero core {{of isolation}} and fear". She went on to call the album's release as [...] "the moment Gaga cements herself as a real star". Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commended Gaga for being [...] "willing to try new things" [...] and felt that the album shows [...] "she's not complacent with doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again [...] Gaga is allowed {{to make a few}} mistakes on her way towards pop nirvana—and judging what she's aiming for with The Fame Monster, there's a good chance she's going to get there sooner than later." [...] Mikael Woods from Los Angeles Times felt that The Fame Monster continued to demonstrate Gaga's creative ambition and stylistic range.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the press}} conference of the comet’s discovery, Hale praised the {{reporting}} done by the “the very first reporter that broke {{the story of the}} comet’s discovery,” the Albuquerque Journal’s science reporter John Fleck: John spoiled me. The rest of the media... were mostly not like him. I would go round and round <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> {{and over and over again}} and they would still get it wrong.|$|R

"MY DEAR CARLYLE,--I {{have been}} writing a good many letters all in a batch, to go by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opportunity; and I am {{thoroughly}} weary of writing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> and over again to different people. My letter to you therefore, I fear, must have much {{of the character of}} remainder-biscuit.

2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you {{get caught up in the}} creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} crabs began {{performing}} their antics again, {{but they did}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> and over, so Cap'n Bill and Trot soon tired, as Merla said they would, and decided they had seen enough of the crab circus. So they proceeded to swim farther up the rocky canyon, and near its upper end {{they came to a}} lot of conch shells lying upon the sandy bottom. A funny-looking crab was sticking his head out from each of these shells.|$|R
40|$|Search {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} needs of problem solvers. Usually the problem solvers suffer from retracing conclusions. If a problem solver cached its inference, then it would not need to retrace conclusions that it had already derived earlier in the search.

6000|$|The queen {{asked him}} if he was happy, and {{he shook his head and}} replied, [...] "It isn't like Calcutta, where I used to work in gold before I was wrecked at sea and nearly drowned. Zog rescued me and brought me here a slave. It is a stupid life we lead, doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> and over every day, but perhaps it is better than being dead. I'm not sure. The only {{pleasure}} I get in life is in creating pretty things out of gold." ...|$|R
2500|$|The band plays music more {{oriented}} towards '70s guitar-driven {{rock bands}} because, as Wood stated, [...] "etal just becomes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over. Anyway, I'm {{not really a}} metal dude. None of us are. I'm sure if you studied pictures of 3 Inches of Blood you could pick us out as not really belonging there". Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E

5000|$|... "It {{was very}} strange for me, because my {{experience}} in this business has been with one band and one label. The last couple years I was not only on my own making {{a record of the}} magnitude that I committed myself to, but I was having to deal with being like a brand new artist going around to all these different labels and meeting with them and hearing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>over</b> and over: 'Yeah, we love it.
