5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|A major subplot {{involves}} George (Richardo Keens-Douglas), a French {{teacher and}} former intimate of Zero's. George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and {{is taking a}} drug that is manufactured by a company <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during {{the final days of}} his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E

5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions had written a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, recalled in 2013 <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms {{if it were to}} have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result {{he would have to}} redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

She won the support of UNISON after announcing her intention to enter the deputy leadership contest, and was also backed by the Communication Workers' Union, Unite, the GMB, and the Musicians' Union.|$|E

He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English).

Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
