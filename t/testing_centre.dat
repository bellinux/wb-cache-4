25|$|On Saturday 19 November 2011, Youth Challenge International (YCI), in {{partnership}} with local and international organizations celebrated International Men's Day {{for the first time}} in Arusha and Morogoro, Tanzania. In Arusha, YCI, The Umoja Centre, Support for International Change, UMATI, Initiative for Youth Organization and Global Service Corps hosted the event at the Mbauda Open Market Ground. This event was aimed to promote men and boys as positive role models and to educate the community on the role of males and females in health, education, family life, violence and life choices. The event included performances, games, and educational activities. Over 500 youth and other community members came together to acknowledge the roles and responsibilities of men and boys in creating a brighter future for all Tanzanians. To celebrate the event in Morogoro, volunteers, along with partner organization Faraja Trust Fund, held a soccer tournament on with 8 local teams. To qualify to participate in the tournament each team had to come to two information sessions on male sexual and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, gender roles and good governance. YCI and Faraja provided an on-site HIV <b>testing</b> <b>centre,</b> a DJ with music and dancing throughout the day, and drama group performances on the key objectives of International Men's Day. Plans exist for the Tanzanian Men's Rights Organisation (TAMRA) to celebrate International men's day in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|SPEAK, the Voice for the Animals is a British {{animal rights}} {{campaign}} founded in 2003 {{that aims to}} end animal experimentation in the UK. It has to date fought against two projects. The first was a proposed non-human primate research facility at the University of Cambridge, which was abandoned in 2004, {{in part because of}} the protests. Its current campaign is focused on a new animal <b>testing</b> <b>centre</b> at the University of Oxford, [...] the Biomedical Sciences Building, which SPEAK has opposed since it was first publicly proposed in 2004. The centre was officially opened on November 11, 2008 and was designed to house a variety of animals, mainly rodents, fish and ferrets, and will include non-human primates.|$|E
2500|$|The English {{statistician}} Francis Galton {{made the}} first attempt at creating a standardized test for rating a person's intelligence. A pioneer of psychometrics {{and the application of}} statistical methods to the study of human diversity and the study of inheritance of human traits, he believed that intelligence was largely a product of heredity (by which he did not mean genes, although he did develop several pre-Mendelian theories of particulate inheritance). He hypothesized that there should exist a correlation between intelligence and other observable traits such as reflexes, muscle grip, and head size. He set up the first mental <b>testing</b> <b>centre</b> in the world in 1882 and he published [...] "Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development" [...] in 1883, in which he set out his theories. After gathering data on a variety of physical variables, he was unable to show any such correlation, and he eventually abandoned this research.|$|E
