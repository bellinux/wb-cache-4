5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E
25|$|Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) visits Stan with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) {{as he is}} {{in desperate}} need of money. Stan forces Shirley, who he has been estranged from him the longest, to accept the money, and their angst is {{revealed}} to have started when Stan's drinking meant a young Mick and Tina went into care. Stan gives Shirley Deano's (Matt Di Angelo) mobile number, saying that he is now going by the name of Dean. A few weeks later, Shirley learns from her aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) that Dean has been staying with Stan. Shirley visits him, expecting to see Dean but Stan tells her that Dean went away a few days ago. A few weeks later, Mick receives news that Stan has been involved in an accident and broken his ankle. He visits him in hospital and Tina brings him to the pub, where they agree <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for three weeks. After Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) forbids Stan to smoke in the house, he secretly smokes out of the window whilst the family is out, accidentally causing a small fire when the cigarette is not stubbed out properly. He is rescued by his great-grandson Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) who {{the rest of the family}} believed was still serving in Afghanistan. It is revealed Lee has been staying with Stan for a week. After Mick believes Stan has been wetting the bed, a furious Stan demands to be taken back home. Whilst there, he is visited by Dean, who is in trouble with the law for handling stolen goods. When the police arrive, Stan takes the blame and is arrested. Mick later collects him and returns him to Walford.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, {{and he was}} [...] "reviled... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, {{many of those who}} decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front page article in The Daily Mirror stated that Wodehouse [...] "lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart,... was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts... even <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in the internment camp." [...] In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.|$|E

5000|$|Despite losing millions, Bernhard was {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>sticking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> There {{were a lot}} of reasons for optimism. In spite of the tremendous number of on field mistakes in 1983, the team had played with heart under Jauch, taking better teams down to the wire even {{at the end of the}} season. With just a few lucky breaks the Federals might have been almost a [...]500 team—and at best, a 12-6 team—in 1983. They had started the season 1-13, but had finished strongly going 3-1 in the last 4 games of the season. It appeared that the Federals had finally learned how to turn a close game into a win. With the league-wide talent pool expected to be stretched out due to expansion, the schedule seemed likely to be littered with a number of very winnable games. With McQuilken's post-season retirement, the team had an undisputed and seemingly capable starter at QB in Hohensee. The Birmingham Stallions' acquisition of Cliff Stoudt made their quarterback Reggie Collier available and the Federals added him for depth alongside Hohensee and rookie Lou Pagley. Star HB Craig James was healthy. It seemed like the pitfalls that Jauch had fallen into in the first season might be missed this time around. Player familiarity with the system and their teammates and having a proven winner like Jauch as a coach suggested the Federals were bound to deliver better results in 1984.|$|R

The next day, Mona is pleased, but Bob becomes {{depressed}} when he considers what his upper class friends and family will think, especially his father, Colonel Harrison (Henry Stephenson), and his fiancée and friend since childhood, Jo Mercer (Rosalind Russell). Though Jo welcomes Mona without resentment, the colonel {{and the rest of}} Bob's social circle are cold toward her.

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with both {{versions}} of the Wranglers, Phoenix-area fans largely viewed the Outlaws with indifference. For {{the second year in a}} row, attendance dropped -- from the 25,568 George Allen's Wranglers' drew the year before, to 17,881. [...] The crowds looked even smaller than that due to the spacious configuration of Sun Devil Stadium. [...] The Outlaws actually drew 4,000 fewer fans than they did in Tulsa, even though Sun Devil Stadium was almost double the size of Skelly Stadium. Despite this, the Tathams hoped <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> once the league won their lawsuit against the NFL.|$|E
2500|$|During the movie's {{production}} from June 2005 to July 2007, the filmmakers shot more than 250 hours of footage with exclusive, unprecedented access to Valentino and his entourage.

2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me." ...|$|E

5000|$|During the Silurian, [...] was readily available, {{so little}} water needed {{expending}} to acquire it. By {{the end of}} the Carboniferous, when [...] levels had lowered to something approaching today's, around 17 times more water was lost per unit of [...] uptake. However, even in these [...] "easy" [...] early days, water was at a premium, and had to be transported to parts of the plant from the wet soil to avoid desiccation. This early water transport took advantage of the cohesion-tension mechanism inherent in water. Water has a tendency to diffuse to areas that are drier, and this process is accelerated when water can be wicked along a fabric with small spaces. In small passages, such as that between the plant cell walls (or in tracheids), a column of water behaves like rubber - when molecules evaporate from one end, they pull the molecules behind them along the channels. Therefore, transpiration alone provided the driving force for water transport in early plants. However, without dedicated transport vessels, the cohesion-tension mechanism cannot transport water more than about 2 cm, severely limiting the size of the earliest plants. This process demands a steady supply of water from one end, to maintain the chains; to avoid exhausting it, plants developed a waterproof cuticle. Early cuticle may not have had pores but did not cover the entire plant surface, so that gas exchange could continue. However, dehydration at times was inevitable; early plants cope with this by having a lot of water stored between their cell walls, and when <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> the tough times by putting life [...] "on hold" [...] until more water is supplied.|$|R
