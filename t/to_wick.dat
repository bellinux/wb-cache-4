5|$|John flirts with Catherine at a ball, {{but she is}} more {{interested}} in meeting with Henry and his sister, Eleanor (Catherine Walker). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E

In contrast, reeds made from bamboo contain nodes which inhibit the passage of essential oils.|$|E

25|$|The {{branches}} from Muir of Ord to Fortrose {{closed in}} 1951 and the Dornoch Light Railway in 1960 {{as a result}} of competition from road transport. The former junction station at Stanley closed in 1956. In 1960 twenty stations closed on the line <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> and Thurso, resulting in significant time savings. The line was diverted on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line in 1954 to allow the level of Loch Luichart to be raised for a hydro-electric project.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War the British Navy's base at Scapa Flow, in the Orkney Islands, was {{serviced}} from Scrabster Harbour near Thurso. The Highland Railway provided transport, {{including a}} daily Jellicoe Express passenger special, which ran between London and Thurso in about 22 hours. In 1923, the company passed on approximately 494 miles (795km) of line {{as it became}} part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Although its shorter branches have closed, former Highland Railway lines remain open from Inverness <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> and Thurso, Kyle of Lochalsh, Keith (as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness Line), as well as the direct main line south to Perth.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{retired in}} 1896, after an {{accident}} testing a locomotive. He {{was replaced by}} Peter Drummond, who had worked at LB, North British and Caledonian Railways before joining the Highland. The first locomotives designed by Drummond were the 'Small Bens' that closely followed locomotive design on the NBR and CR. A total of 20 were built by Dübs & Co., Highland Railway at Lochgorm and North British Loco Co. in 1898–1901 and 1906, these were smaller than the Loch Class, and they normally worked on the line north <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> and Thurso and east to Keith. Drummond designed a 0-6-0 goods locomotive, and twelve were built between 1900 and 1907 by Dübs & Co. and the North British Loco Co. These had boilers and cylinders interchangeable with the 'Small Bens'.|$|E

2500|$|The bilingual {{road sign}} policy of Highland Region Council {{has led to}} some {{controversy}} in the region. [...] In 2008, eight of the ten Caithness representatives to the Highland Council tried to prevent the introduction of bilingual English-Gaelic road signs into the county. [...] The first bilingual sign in Caithness was erected in 2012. [...] In 2013, a bilingual road sign on the A99 road next <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> Airport was damaged by gunfire within 24 hours of it being placed. [...] Gaelic-speaking Councillor Alex MacLeod, at the time representing Landward Caithness in the Highland Council, {{referred to it as}} “an extreme anti-Gaelic incident”.|$|E
2500|$|Wargames have {{origins in}} ancient {{strategy}} games, particularly Chess. It originated as Chaturanga, created in ancient India as a simulation of Indian warfare, with pieces representing infantry, cavalry, chariots and war elephants. According to RPG designer John Wick, Chess {{can be turned}} into a role-playing game if chess pieces such as the king, queen, rooks, knights or pawns are given names, and decisions are made based on their motivations. According <b>to</b> <b>Wick,</b> Dungeons & Dragons was a [...] "sophisticated, intricate and complicated combat simulation board game that people were turning into a roleplaying game" [...] just [...] "like giving your rook a motive" [...] in Chess.|$|E
2500|$|A railway linking Thurso and Wick {{had been}} {{proposed}} in the 1860s and had the necessary authority in 1866, but had failed to raise the necessary funds. The Sutherland & Caithness was authorised {{to take over the}} route of the Thurso and Wick railway, and extend the line south to link up with the Duke of Sutherland's railway at Helmsdale. With the Duke of Sutherland subscribing £60,000 and the Highland railway £50,000, the railway opened on 28 July 1874. [...] Initially two trains a day covered the [...] from Inverness <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> in between 7 and [...] hours, by 1885 the fastest trains were taking 6 hours, and in 1914 the Further North Express took [...] hours.|$|E

2500|$|If the cathode and anode are {{connected}} by an external conductor, electrons would pass through that external circuit (light bulb in figure), while the ions {{pass through the}} salt bridge to maintain charge balance until such a time as the anode and cathode reach electrical equilibrium of zero volts as chemical equilibrium is reached in the cell. In the process the zinc anode is dissolved while the copper electrode is plated with copper. [...] The so-called [...] "salt bridge" [...] is not made of salt but could be made of material able <b>to</b> <b>wick</b> the cations and anions (salts) in the solutions, where the flow of positively charged cations along the [...] "bridge" [...] amounts to {{the same number of}} negative charges flowing in the opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|The Aberdeen to Inverness Line {{currently}} {{uses the}} line to Keith with stations at Nairn, Forres and Elgin. Eleven trains a day run between Aberdeen and Inverness, taking about [...] hours, supplemented {{by a couple of}} early morning trains from Elgin to Inverness. There are plans for a regular hourly Aberdeen to Inverness service with additional hourly trains between Inverness and Elgin and a new station at Dalcross, and Network Rail are evaluating what line upgrades are necessary. The Far North Line is served by four trains a day from Inverness <b>to</b> <b>Wick,</b> via Thurso, taking about [...] hours, supplemented by four services to Invergordon, Tain or Ardgay. The Kyle Line is served by four trains a day from Inverness that take about [...] hours.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{carriages}} {{used by the}} Inverness & Nairn Railway were of {{the short}} four-wheeled type and had accommodation for first and third class. A mail van made in 1858 for the Inverness to Keith route survived until 1903; this was [...] long, and fitted with Newall's chain brake. Luggage was carried on the roof, behind a railing, where {{there was also a}} seat for the guard, and dogs were placed in a boot. Later carriages did not have the seat for the guard and space for luggage on the roof. Longer carriages were ordered for the line <b>to</b> <b>Wick,</b> [...] long, and these seated 50 passengers in third class. Six-wheeled carriages were introduced in the late 1870s, the first class seating sixteen passenger with access to toilets and the third class seating fifty passengers; these were still lit by oil lamps. Second class accommodation was available after the direct line to Perth opened, but this was not popular as it offering little extra comfort over third class, and was abolished in 1893. A six-wheeled carriage built at Lochgram in 1909 has been preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Bozzle was, of course, {{convinced}} that the lady whom he was employed to watch was--no better than she ought to be. That is the usual Bozzlian language for broken vows, secrecy, intrigue, dirt, and adultery. It was his business to obtain evidence of her guilt. There was no question to be solved as to her innocency. The Bozzlian mind would have regarded any such suggestion {{as the product of}} a green softness, the possession of which would have made him quite unfit for his profession. He was aware that ladies who are no better than they should be are often very clever,--so clever, as to make it necessary that the Bozzles who shall at last confound them should be first-rate Bozzles, Bozzles quite {{at the top of their}} profession,--and, therefore, he went about his work with great industry and much caution. Colonel Osborne was at the present moment in Scotland. Bozzle was sure of that. He was quite in the north of Scotland. Bozzle had examined his map, and had found that Wick, which was the Colonel's post-town, was very far north indeed. He had half a mind to run down <b>to</b> <b>Wick,</b> as he was possessed by a certain honest zeal, which made him long to do something hard and laborious; but his experience told him that it was very easy for the Colonel to come up to the neighbourhood of St. Diddulph's, whereas the lady could not go down <b>to</b> <b>Wick,</b> unless she were to decide upon throwing herself into her lover's arms,--whereby Bozzle's work would be brought to an end. He, therefore, confined his immediate operations to St. Diddulph's.|$|E
60|$|Every {{moment of}} my life now I regretted the {{unguarded}} precipitancy with which I had saved this woman. What was it to me whether she had lived or died? I was no young, hot-headed youth to do such things. It was bad enough to be compelled to have Madge in the house, but she was old and ugly, and could be ignored. This one was young and lively, and so fashioned as to divert attention from graver things. Where could I send her, and what could I do with her? If I sent information <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> it would mean that officials and others would come to me and pry, and peep, and chatter--a hateful thought. It was better to endure her presence than that.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{operation}} {{was changed to}} multiple unit trains in the 1990s, using class 156 sets at first, and later class 158. The service pattern was altered so that trains <b>to</b> <b>Wick</b> ran from Georgemas to Thurso and back <b>to</b> <b>Wick,</b> saving operating costs.|$|E
