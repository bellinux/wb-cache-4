This part of the building has a flat ceiling lined with similar sheeting, which extends over part of the magazine.|$|E
40|$|During {{reconstruction}} of the vaults of the Lima’s cathedral, in the seventeenth century, master builders searched for construction systems that were more resistant to seismic activity. The original vaults, due to the earthquake of 1609, were extremely damaged. This situation motivated a discussion to analyze the causes of damages and the features that would require their reconstruction. It was thought desirable that the new construction would be Gothic-ribbed vaults, not as a return to an ancient aesthetic style, but because the masons thought this kind of vault could better resist the earthquakes than the existing barrel vaults. However the continuing damages and collapses prompted a second discussion, {{to determine the best}} way to rebuild these vaults. This time the problems of the ribbed vaults were discussed under horizontal loads, possible antiseismic solutions were adopted and the possibility of changing the masonry vaults for the nascent curved <b>timber</b> <b>plank</b> in the colonial lands, especially after the highly structural efficient response proven by the wooden vaults in some parish churches...|$|E

40|$|This entire {{research}} work is focused {{for the performance}} evaluation of an Innovative tea dryer using a technique of mathematical modeling. The innovative tea dryer was designed and fabricated targeting the group of farmers who cultivate bio tea /organic tea in few acres amidst of lot of constraints. Main challenge {{for the production of}} tea at small scale is consistent drying. Since drying is a key factor affecting the quality of the ultimate product of tea, the simulation results of the mathematical model explain the drying performance and how the physical model or the prototype could be scaled. The tea sector has always been a vital component of Sri Lanka’s economy. Sri Lanka as the third biggest tea producing country globally, has a production share of 9 % in the international sphere, and one of the world's leading exporters with a share of around 19 % of the global demand. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed at approximately 187, 309 hectares. Much of the growth boost in low grown tea production is attributed to the rise of the tea smallholders who are concentrated in the low-country. It is estimated that the smallholders occupy about 65 to 70 % of the tea extent in the country and their contribution to overall production has also now risen to around 65 to 70 %. Since the organic tea has an increasing demand and a good overseas market the tea cultivators of small holders are encouraged to produce organic tea. In the traditional or 'orthodox' procedure, the process used to make loose tea, the leaves must go through a process of Withering, Rolling, Oxidation /fermentation and Drying. Among these processes, withering and fermentation are taken place as a result of environmental conditions except rolling and drying. Rolling could be done manually on a serrated <b>timber</b> <b>plank</b> as the quantity is small. Dholes followed by the above three processes are fed into the innovative dryer for the making of tea. This dryer was completed as two stages with two cylinders having concentric perforated cylinders inside. Two hot air generators are being used to supply the hot air where saw dust is burnt for the supply of thermal energy for the first stage drying and the electricity is used in second stage drying, The cylinders are rotating at the same speed of about 12 rpm, and screw feeder is used for the feeding of material into rotating inner cylinder at a constant rate without the material being clogged at the entrance. Analyzing the direction of material and hot air flow inside the cylinder the dryer {{is said to be the}} type of cross-flow co-current. The two drums and the material feeder are powered by a single motor of ½ hp with a gearing ratio of 1 : 30. As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one. As per the raw material and other drying parameters, the dryer type for the innovative dryer has been selected as cross flow, co current rotary type considering physical properties of the drying materials. Testing of this innovative dryer under real conditions and its results are further illustrated in the report. Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details. The mathematical model and simulated results using Matlab show how far the model relate with the actual performance. The accuracy of simulation results of the mathematical model is highly depend upon the accuracy of the experiments carried out at various situations for finding out the dryer constant and the characteristic constants using physical models.

40|$|An {{increased}} demand for processed goods on the property market has contributed to investments within the Swedish sawmill industry. The purpose with {{this study is to}} make a market investigation of pre cut lengths within a defined geographic area. The constituent for this investigation is HAL (AB Hilmer Andersson) who invests in a new plane facility and two finger jointing machines in affiliation to their sawmill in Lässerud, the vest part of Värmland. To investigate the demand of pre cut lengths and identifies the value creating factors and cost factors which the customer within the segments industry and property market perceive, have different customer value theories been used. Theories of customer value and the theory about offering has been the source of creating the qualitative interview with a selection of current and new potential customers for HAL. The result of the study first gives an introduction of HAL’s new offering and a description of HAL’s current customers, which gives the reader an understanding of why searching for new customers is made in the defined area. The result of the visit interviews (which were made with a selection of current customers) concretises the value creating factors and cost factors which they perceive in current business relation with HAL. An analyse of the result were made with a customer-value-model. The just-in-time and product attribute together with a good personal relation was the main value creating factors, while the price of the product was the conclusive cost factor. A register of interesting Swedish and Norwegian customers were constituted. HAL made a selection of new potential customers from the register that I made visit interviews with. HAL also made a selection of new customers which was called to prove the reliability of the result. The customer which HAL didn’t select {{can be used as a}} future customer database. A match was made between the new potential customers and the value HAL has approved that they can deliver their customers. It was shown in the analyse that all the new potential customers in general matched the value HAL can deliver. Though one of the new potential customers demanded products that HAL cannot produce in their new facility, however there was other in the range of HAL’s products that could be of interest instead. Demanded assortment for the industry customers was pre cut (in millimetre precision) lengths which were direct adapted for their own production. The mostly demanded pre cut lengths of interest were approximately 2, 5 m for weathering and structural <b>timber.</b> <b>Plank</b> which are used for the course of logs or roof construction are demanded pre cut in longer lengths (more than 5, 4 m). However lengths up to 12 m are today (2010) low. This is mostly apparent in the property market where the most of their own customers are DIY (Do-It-Yourself) and pro customers and they often demand shorter lengths than 6 - 7 m. The roof truss manufacturer (which is a part of the industry segment, due to HAL’s definition) has neither stock capacity for lengths over 6 m nor handling capabilities in their own plants. They demanded timber package that were cut in module lengths which they cut with the angels needed for their own roof truss constructions. The conclusion is therefore that the demand seems to be highest both for pre cut lengths and lengths up to 12 m in the industry segment. Finally in the study there is a review of the usefulness of qualitative research methods for market investigations within the sawmill industry. If HAL takes part of understanding both value creating and cost creating factors the investment will be a successful choice at a customer perspective, because there is a demand big enough to reach HAL’s increase in production capacity in the geographic studied area...|$|E
