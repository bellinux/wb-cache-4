Our model allows to consider {{a certain kind of}} structural information: tags that represent logical structure (title, section, etc.) as well as tags related to formatting (bold font, <b>centered</b> <b>text,</b> etc.). We first take into account the tags influence by estimating the probability that tags distinguishes terms which are the most relevant. Then, these weights are impacted on terms weighting function using several combining schemes. Experiments on a large collection during INEX 2008 XML IR evaluation campaign (INitiative for Evaluation of XML Retrieval) showed that using tags leads to improvements on focused retrieval...|$|R

50|$|Word processors, by contrast, <b>center</b> <b>text</b> {{based on}} a {{computer}} algorithm using a fixed central reference point rather than the left margin on the typewriter as measured from the paper's edge. If the paper in a printer is flush {{to the left of}} the paper guide, then a word processor will achieve the same centering throughout a given page and on different pages. The bloggers asserted that it is unlikely that two documents produced 3 months apart by a manual centering process would exactly overlap. In the Killian memos the text matches perfectly when overlaid with a word processor-produced 3 line address block, and between the 3- and 2- line blocks of different memos.|$|R

Additional information such as [...] "photographs of investment properties or descriptions of the tax benefits of investments" [...] are not allowed in financial tombstones. However, another view is that in the 19th century, financial notices were published in newspapers alongside birth and death notices.|$|R
