5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
25|$|While Maddy {{gets out}} with her story, the two men set out for Captain Poison's encampment. Dia, {{stationed}} with the RUF garrison there, is confronted by Vandy, but having been brainwashed he refuses to acknowledge his father. Archer radios the site's coordinates to Coetzee, who directs a combined air and ground assault on the camp; Vandy finds Captain Poison and beats him {{to death with a}} shovel as the mercenaries overwhelm the RUF defenders. Coetzee then forces Vandy to produce the diamond, but is killed by Archer, who realizes Coetzee would eventually kill them both. Dia holds the pair briefly at gunpoint, but Vandy confronts him again and renews their bond. Pursued by vengeful mercenaries, Archer discloses he has been mortally wounded and entrusts the stone to Vandy, telling him to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with Archer's pilot, who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy; they share final farewells as he asks her to assist Vandy, and gives her permission to finish her article. Archer finally takes in the beautiful African landscape before dying.|$|E
25|$|In Chullin 92a-b Ulla {{says that}} here are 30 laws which {{the sons of}} Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion {{in the market and}} to respect the Torah. The rest of the laws are not listed. Talmud {{commentator}} Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to. Though the authorities seem to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted that Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.|$|E

25|$|Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th {{birthday}} in the Shire, reuniting {{with his old}} friend, Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals that he intends on leaving the Shire for one last adventure, and leaves his inheritance to his nephew, Frodo, including the Ring. Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted by the Ring and tries to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself, Gandalf intervenes. Telling Frodo to keep the Ring hidden, he investigates it, and discovers its true identity, returning to warn Frodo. Learning that Gollum was tortured by Orcs, {{and told them that}} Bilbo took the Ring, Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard, meeting fellow wizard Saruman the White, but learns that he is in cahoots with Sauron, who has unleashed the Ringwraiths to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf, but are instead aided by a ranger named Strider, a friend of Gandalf's, who escorts them to Rivendell.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} Jeff Simon described Hoffman as [...] "probably {{the most}} in-demand character actor of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted {{that he would}} be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, [...] "I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out." [...] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in [...] "a school-of-hard-knocks way", remarking that [...] "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, [...] "ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." [...] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.|$|E
500|$|Juxtaposed {{against the}} {{struggle}} to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood. The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of [...] "the great Secret (that) lurks in the story". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra [...] "Penny" [...] Baxter delivers to his son Jody {{at the end of}} The Yearling: [...] "Ever’ man wants life to be a fine thing, and [...] easy. ’Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but ’tain’t easy.

They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself. As you can imagine, something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, you can also lose -- or you can just lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E

500|$|In a {{collection}} of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71) represents the ultimate attribution, as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by Giorgione. [...] In his 1902 catalogue Charles Hercules Read mentions {{that many of the}} pendants had been attributed to Cellini, but refrains from endorsing the attributions. [...] A small silver hand-bell (WB.95) had belonged to Horace Walpole, who praised it extravagantly in a letter as [...] "the uniquest thing in the world, a silver bell for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini. It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself; indeed so does his Perseus. Well, my bell is in the finest taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, lizards, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that you would <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> one of the plagues of Egypt. They are all in altissimo, nay in out-issimo relievo and yet almost invisible but with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" [...] However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by Wenzel Jamnitzer, goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II, to whom it is still attributed. [...] Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door-knocker, with a figure of Neptune, 40cm high, and weighing over 11 kilos.|$|E
