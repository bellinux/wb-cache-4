5|$|Following the {{development}} of fabric structures expertise on the projects with Frei Otto, BuroHappold was instrumental in further developing the knowledge and technology of fabric structures. With Bodo Rasch, a protégé of Frei Otto, and drawing on experience from the Pink Floyd canopies, they designed folding, umbrella-like canopies <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> the courtyard of Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (The Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina, Saudi Arabia. They also designed the, at the time, largest fabric canopy in Europe at the Ashford Designer Outlet in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving <b>to</b> <b>shade,</b> standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important reason why {{it was able to}} play such a large role in the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E

5|$|Safety {{improvements}} {{continued in}} the 1990s. A five-mile (8km) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant treatment {{was added to the}} areas that receive no sun in the winter due <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen. At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen, a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips that {{emphasized}} mild sadomasochism and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up on trying <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> in his mouth and simply outlining it.|$|E
5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E

30|$|Here we {{have found}} that all shading {{treatments}} significantly increased the concentration of both 2 -AP and GABA in the grain of Yuxiangyouzhan than Nongxiang 18; furthermore, positive correlation between the accumulation of these compounds was observed in both varieties. Although GABA has been shown to accumulate in response to a range of stresses, direct assessment of the impact of shade on GABA accumulation appears limited; our results demonstrate that the conserved response of GABA to plant stress extends <b>to</b> <b>shading</b> in rice. Furthermore, our results indicate that the association between plant stress and accumulation of 2 -AP exists for <b>shading</b> in addition <b>to</b> drought and salt. We also assessed accumulation of proline in reponse <b>to</b> <b>shading</b> treatment. This was significantly increased in Yuxiangyouzhan by S 1 and S 2 treatment; in contrast, no significant effect was detected for any shading treatment in Nongxiang 18. This suggests that there may be substantial variation of proline accumulation in response <b>to</b> <b>shading</b> in fragrant rice varieties.|$|R

25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first game}} {{was at the}} MCG on New Year’s Day 1862, against a Victorian XVIII. The Englishmen also wore {{coloured}} sashes around their waists to identify each player and were presented with hats <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> them from the sun. Some estimates put {{the crowd at the}} MCG that day at 25,000. It must have been quite a picture with a new 6000 seat grandstand, coloured marquees ringing the ground and a carnival outside. Stephenson said that the ground was better than any in England. The Victorians however, were no match for the English at cricket and the visitors won by an innings and 96 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{rack and}} {{internal}} fuel lines for carrying a 300L (80US gal) under-fuselage drop-tank were widely used on G-2s, {{as were the}} underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas. Several G-2s were fitted with the ETC 500 bomb rack, capable of carrying one 250kg (550lb) bomb. The final G-2 production batches built by Erla and Messerschmitt Regensburg were equipped as tropical aircraft (often referred to as G-2 trop), equipped with a sand-filter {{on the front of}} the supercharger intake and two small, teardrop-shaped metal brackets on the left side of the fuselage, below the cockpit sill. These were used as mounts for specially designed sun umbrellas (called Sonderwerkzeug or Special tool), which were used <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|Although {{intertidal}} ecology {{has traditionally}} focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence that positive interactions are also important. Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of Juncus and Iva {{are unable to}} tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants <b>to</b> <b>shade</b> the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|PA 433 was {{designated}} in 1928 {{to run from}} US 11 near Red Bridge north to US 522 in Shade Gap, heading north along its present route and then heading northwest through Roxbury and Spring Run before reaching Shade Gap. PA 641 became concurrent with a portion of PA 433 west of Roxbury in 1937. In the 1960s, {{the north end of}} PA 433 was cut back to PA 997 in Lurgan Township, with the former alignment north of there becoming PA 997 to Roxbury, solely PA 641 to the west of Roxbury, unnumbered Cold Spring Road and Amberson Road (now PA 641 Truck), and an extended PA 641 west <b>to</b> <b>Shade</b> Gap.|$|E

Don Baylor became the first designated hitter to win the American League Most Valuable Player award. Other contributors to the team, which featured a powerful offense, were Bert Campaneris, Rod Carew, Dan Ford and Bobby Grich. However, the Angels lost what then was a best 3-out-of-5 American League Championship Series to the Baltimore Orioles, managed by Earl Weaver, 3 games to 1.
