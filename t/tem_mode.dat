500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences in the operation of waveguide filters compared to transmission line designs concerns the mode of transmission of the electromagnetic wave carrying the signal. [...] In a transmission line, the wave is associated with electric currents on a pair of conductors. [...] The conductors constrain the currents to be parallel to the line, and consequently both the magnetic and electric components of the electromagnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave. [...] This transverse mode is designated TEM (transverse electromagnetic). [...] On the other hand, there are infinitely many modes that any completely hollow waveguide can support, but the <b>TEM</b> <b>mode</b> is not one of them. Waveguide modes are designated either TE (transverse electric) or TM (transverse magnetic), followed by a pair of suffixes identifying the precise mode.|$|E

500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and {{stripline}} implementations but does not work so well in the now popular microstrip format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual <b>TEM</b> <b>mode</b> found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] A better solution for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6. [...] This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring. [...] The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main line power making the work of the detector diode easier.Vizmuller, pp.102–103 ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{performance}} issues addressed by the waffle-iron filter is that in many waveguide filters the attenuation {{is dependent on the}} transmission modes of the incident signal and some filters can be quite bad at suppressing spurious modes which may be contained in this signal. [...] For instance, with the corrugated waveguide filter, on which the waffle-iron filter is based, attenuation of TEn0 modes in the stopband is strongly dependent on the mode number. [...] This is not the case with the waffle-iron filter which attenuates all TEn0 modes nearly equally up to a certain frequency. [...] The limit is the frequency at which the distance between the metal teeth is greater than half the free-space wavelength of the signal. [...] The reason for the waffle-iron design's good performance in this respect is that the distance between the teeth is the same in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and nearly the same in all directions in between. [...] This makes the waffle-iron nearly isotropic to TEM waves in all these directions. [...] Since any TEn0 mode wave can be decomposed into two <b>TEM</b> <b>mode</b> waves travelling in different diagonal directions, all TEn0 modes are affected nearly equally.|$|E
