5|$|In {{reviewing}} <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> of botanical history it {{is evident}} that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 747 is a large, {{wide-body}} (two-aisle) airliner {{with four}} wing-mounted engines. The wings {{have a high}} sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise of Mach0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. <b>The</b> <b>sweep</b> also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.|$|E
5000|$|The ride {{starts off}} at a slow spin, {{propelling}} <b>the</b> <b>sweeps</b> upward due to both centrifugal force and a pneumatic cylinder housed in the center shaft. The speed is increased until the cars reach their maximum height propelled by the motor then pneumatics are engaged. The operator will then begin to ("bounce" [...] or [...] "pop") <b>the</b> <b>sweeps</b> by sending <b>the</b> ride into a freewheel mode then hitting a zoom button that fills the center cylinder with air yanking <b>the</b> <b>sweeps</b> upward, when <b>the</b> operator let's off the button air is rapidly blead resulting in <b>the</b> <b>sweeps</b> dropping until <b>the</b> operator zooms <b>the</b> <b>sweeps</b> upward again. This is repeated multiple times before the ride tops off to its max allowable height. The operator can do a reverse pop of <b>the</b> <b>sweeps</b> to rapidly stabilize the bounce and disengage rotation until the ride begins to slow down for landing on the tower rim.|$|R

25|$|The display {{shows the}} {{vertical}} signal {{in one of}} several modes: the main timebase, or the delayed timebase only, or a combination thereof. When <b>the</b> delayed <b>sweep</b> is active, <b>the</b> main <b>sweep</b> trace brightens while <b>the</b> delayed <b>sweep</b> is advancing. In one combination mode, provided only on some oscilloscopes, the trace changes from <b>the</b> main <b>sweep</b> to <b>the</b> delayed <b>sweep</b> once <b>the</b> delayed <b>sweep</b> starts, although less of <b>the</b> delayed fast <b>sweep</b> is visible for longer delays. Another combination mode multiplexes (alternates) the main and delayed sweeps so that both appear at once; a trace separation control displaces them.|$|R
5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} go-ahead {{was given}} at 14:00. At 15:30, some 58–80 Ju 88s from I., II., and III./LG 1, escorted by 30 Bf 110s of V./LG 1, took off to bomb Boscombe Down and Worthy Down. RAF Andover {{was to be}} bombed as well, {{with the support of}} 52 Ju 87s from StG 1 and StG 2 who were to strike at RAF Warmwell and Yeovil. I./JG 53 flew a fighter sweep ahead of the bombers from Poole to Lyme Regis in order to tempt the RAF into battle. I./JG 53 made landfall at 16:00. <b>The</b> <b>sweep</b> failed to attract and divert RAF squadrons. Instead, all it succeeded in doing was to alert the RAF defences a critical five minutes earlier. When the main wave of LG 1 and StG 2 arrived over the coast, they were greeted by 77 RAF fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} Prior Park was to {{construct}} five buildings along three {{sides of a}} dodecagon matching <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> {{of the head of}} the valley, with the main building being flanked by elongated wings based on designs by Andrea Palladio. The plans were influenced by drawings in Vitruvius Britannicus originally made by Colen Campbell for Wanstead House in Essex, which was yet to be built. The main block had 15 bays and each of the wings 17 bays each. Between each wing and the main block was a Porte-cochère for coaches to stop under. In addition to the stone from the local quarries, material, including the grand staircase and plasterwork, from the demolished Hunstrete House were used in the construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} month by taking {{two of a}} three-game series against the Giants, besting Jonathan Sánchez, who threw a no-hitter earlier in the 2009 season, and Tim Lincecum, who won the 2008 NL Cy Young Award. This was {{followed}} by a trip to Texas for a four-game series against the Houston Astros; the Phillies were unable to muster much offense during the series and were swept. On September 8, in {{the first game of the}} series against the Washington Nationals, Ibañez and Utley each hit their 30th home runs of the season, making them members of the 12th quartet of teammates in major league history to each reach 30 in a single season, joining Howard and Werth. The Phillies offense backed Lee to his sixth win the following night, with Madson earning his second consecutive save after assuming the de facto closer's role from Lidge. However, the Phillies could not overcome a pair of three-run home runs by Adam Dunn and Ian Desmond to secure <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> in the last game of the series, despite Stairs' grand slam; it was their third loss of the season to Washington in fifteen games. The Mets came to Philadelphia for their last series of the season, which began on September 11. The Phillies won game one, 4–2, but the Mets came from behind in the second game of the series, scoring five runs in the final two innings to win 10–9. Making up a postponed game from earlier in the season, the Phillies won the first game of a day-night doubleheader behind Kyle Kendrick's first major league victory in 13 months. Eight shutout innings from Martínez in the nightcap gave the Phillies a 1–0 win, a 3–1 win in the 4-game set, and a 12–6 win in the season series. Martínez' eight innings also began a streak of 26 consecutive scoreless innings by Phillies pitchers: Madson followed with a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season; Cliff Lee pitched a complete game shutout against the Nationals the following night; and Blanton, Park, and Madson combined for eight scoreless innings against Washington on September 16 until Tyler Walker allowed a run in the top of the ninth inning, an RBI single by Willie Harris which scored Justin Maxwell. Hamels closed out the series with a strong performance, perfect through his first five innings and finishing with one run allowed in eight; with their 15th win over the Nationals, the Phillies matched their best season record against the franchise, set against the 1976 Montréal Expos.|$|E

25|$|With {{triggered}} sweeps, {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|E
25|$|They {{have a few}} (widely spaced) {{frequency}} ranges, {{and relatively}} wide-range continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.|$|E
