5|$|Cornering weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping {{of the rear}} suspension. Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear tire make the largest contribution <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|E
5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} estates were managed by single families. The father acted {{as the head}} manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house {{in exchange for a}} third or a half of their crop yield.|$|E

5|$|Women {{acted as}} an {{important}} part of the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all the major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men <b>to</b> <b>weave.</b> There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading.|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That We Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E
5|$|She {{then had}} the idea <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of the}} silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E

5|$|The Navajo {{may have}} learned <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> from their Pueblo Indian neighbors {{when they moved}} into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women. Women formed {{an important part of}} the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants, and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men <b>to</b> <b>weave.</b> There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, such as Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh Wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she amassed a moveable estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. Lower down the social scale, the rolls of poor relief indicate that large numbers of widows with children endured a marginal existence.|$|E

5|$|Girih are {{elaborate}} interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The {{style is}} used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15thcentury to the 20thcentury. Most designs {{are based on a}} partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem <b>to</b> <b>weave</b> over and under each other. The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.|$|E

50|$|The Tausūg of Jolo {{have always}} been known for their weaving skills {{particularly}} of their silk sashes, shoulder cloth or their male head dress called pis siyabit. Some of the design in the textile are often transposed <b>to</b> <b>woven</b> mat since geometric design technically translate easily from the loom <b>weaving</b> <b>to</b> mat <b>weaving.</b> The design, again like the Samal, are characterized by linearity and geometry. The coastal settlements of Patikul and Maimbung are mat-making towns. Recent importation of machine-made rugs and carpets has replaced mats particularly inside the mosque.|$|R
