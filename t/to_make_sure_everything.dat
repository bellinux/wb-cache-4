500|$|The crew {{spent a long}} {{amount of}} time {{plotting}} out the episode in a room, using sticky notes, {{in order to make}} sure it played out sensibly and was clearly understandable to viewers. The production staff based a lot of the usage of time travel in [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" [...] on those from the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1960). The goal of the crew was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations, including several paradoxes involving time travel. The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements. The hopes of the production staff was to make the episode one that they could watch multiple times and notice something new with each viewing.|$|E

500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion.

[...] A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol {{and to create a}} factory to completely digitise the collection.

[...] The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. [...] There is a [...] "Search the Collections" [...] feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. [...] The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.|$|E
