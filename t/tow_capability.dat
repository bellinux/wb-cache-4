40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} improving the engine oil cooler performance for future vehicle applications, from ideas to simulated concepts. Increasing market expectations of high engine power, low fuel consumption and high <b>towing</b> <b>capabilities</b> results in an ever rising pressure on the cooling system in modern cars. The desire to prevent a future situation where the engine oil could become too hot, {{formed the basis for}} this thesis. The thesis was performed during 10 weeks from March to June 2015, at Volvo Car Corporation in Gothenburg. The working process started with literary studies where the theory behind automotive cooling systems and heat exchangers were studied to increase the general knowledge about the theory. Studies of engine oil, heat transfer and the overall design of engine cooling systems were performed. An important part was to clarify why the oil must not exceed a certain temperature limit. This gave answers to how the oil and engine components would be affected, if the oil did exceed the set temperature limit. To get a clear target and measurable parameters, the goal of this thesis was defined by estimating what the heat transfer demands could be in the future. A competitor analysis was made to examine how and if, the competitors to VCC use a different kind of oil cooling. Generation of concept ideas were made continuously during the early stage of the work process. Concepts that proved to be interesting were analysed more deeply with performance simulations and packaging studies. Five concepts were analysed and the performance simulations indicated that all the presented concepts can reach the heat transfer goal set early in the process. They do however use different methods, and meet the goal with different levels of efficiency. All concepts are listed with their heat transfer performance results and their advantages and disadvantages. The concept that showed to be the most promising in an oil cooling perspective, was to connect an additional heat exchanger in series after the current plate heat exchanger. This is a solution which will support the current engine oil cooler by handling the additional heat produced during certain driving scenarios. The best concept reached a heat transfer rate of 40 kW at half the air flow required by the second best concept. The concepts that has been presented will implicate an alteration of the current oil cooling system design. The lack of available space in the cars will also result in some rearranging of components in order to make space for an additional heat exchanger. The purpose with the concept generation is to present a good foundation from which Volvo can base their future decisions on...|$|R
50|$|The new {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} (IRS) was perceived as being controversial by some {{at the time of}} its introduction. A misconception was that the Expedition's <b>towing</b> and off-road <b>capabilities</b> would be reduced, in comparison to the previous generation's rear live axle. Nevertheless, underbody obstacle clearance improved by half an inch, and up to two inches under the axle differentials. The new suspension reduces rear unsprung mass by 110 pounds, and allows for a full 9.4 inches of suspension travel (how much the wheels can travel up or down) improving its ability to traverse uneven terrain for improved control and ride quality. The four-wheel independent long-travel suspension itself is a purpose-built version of race suspensions found on off-road desert race vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{composite}} shells that may offer {{the potential to}} improve the structural performance of future aircraft fuselage structures were developed under this joint NASA-industry collaborative effort. Two cylindrical shells with tailored, tow-steered layups and continuously varying fiber angle orientations were designed and built at the National Center for Advanced Manufacturing - Louisiana Partnership. The shells were fabricated from unidirectional IM 7 / 8552 graphite-epoxy pre-preg slit tape material fiber-placed on a constant-diameter mandrel. Each shell had the same nominal 8 -ply [plus or minus 45 /plus or minus Theta]s layup, where the nominal fiber angle in the tow-steered plies varied continuously from 10 degrees along the crown to 45 degrees on each side, then back to 10 degrees on the keel. One shell was fabricated with all 24 tows placed during each pass of the fiber placement machine, resulting in many tow overlaps on the shell surface. The fiber placement machine's individual <b>tow</b> cut/restart <b>capability</b> was also used to manufacture a second shell with tow drops and a more uniform laminate thickness.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{performance of}} two advanced composite tow-steered shells with large cutouts, manufactured using an automated fiber placement system, is assessed using both experimental and analytical methods. The fiber orientation angles of the shells vary continuously around their circumference from +/- 10 degrees on the crown and keel, to +/- 45 degrees on the sides. The raised surface features on one shell result from application of all 24 tows during each fiber placement system pass, {{while the second}} shell uses the <b>tow</b> drop/add <b>capability</b> of the system to achieve a more uniform wall thickness. These unstiffened shells, both without and with small cutouts, were previously tested in axial compression and buckled elastically. In this study, a single unreinforced cutout, scaled to represent a cargo door on a commercial aircraft, is machined into one side of each shell. The prebuckling axial stiffnesses and bifurcation buckling loads of these shells with large cutouts are also computed using linear finite element structural analyses for preliminary comparisons with test data. During testing, large displacements are observed around the large cutouts, but the shells maintain an average of 91 percent of the axial stiffness, and also carry 85 percent of the buckling loads, {{when compared to the}} pristine shells without cutouts. These relatively small reductions indicate that there is great potential for using tow steering to mitigate the adverse effects of large cutouts on the overall structural performance...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the current state-of-the-art of iceberg management on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on the East Coast of Canada through {{description of the}} magnitude and range of iceberg conditions, and the approaches used for iceberg detection and towing. There is presently a high standard of iceberg <b>towing</b> and deflection <b>capabilities</b> and iceberg detection frameworks in place, all implemented with generally proven ice management plans and programs. There appear to be no major issues with iceberg towing. The long standing synthetic line tow rope method has been effective for many years. The new iceberg tow net has been demonstrated {{over the past three}} to four years to significantly improve the prospect of managing slippery or otherwise hard to tow small and medium icebergs. Greater experience with the net would improve confidence for vessel captains and industry. Early detection of icebergs and minimizing possible gaps in the spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions coverage provided by the growing range of satellite and radar technologies together with aerial reconnaissance, remain challenges. Further quantification of these coverage parameters and the potential benefits and limitations would be valuable as input into planning and decision-making tasks. Increased operational use of satellites would improve their confidence for all stakeholders. Resource management and decision-making including which icebergs to tow, how soon, in which directions, and for how long are perennial challenges especially with multiple fields since different operators have different needs and priorities. This is significant both from a risk mitigation standpoint, to ensure that the 2 ̆ 01 cbest 2 ̆ 01 d decision can be made, and from a cost perspective so that resources are assigned for appropriate lengths of time. The use of data fusion and decision-making tools would appear to be the obvious route and good progress has been made with each. Better monitoring and assimilation of met-ocean conditions is another factor for the decision-making. The PERD iceberg sighting and iceberg management databases are good information resources and they should be maintained. The databases offer utility {{in a number of areas}} including study of past conditions and performances, for planning future activities, and possibly as input to other initiatives, such as decision-making or data fusion toolboxes and iceberg management planning aid technologies. A suggested plan to identify outstanding iceberg management issues, that in order to solve or measurably improve require dedicated research, is presented. A descriptive list of issues is provided for initial consideration by stakeholders. It is proposed that ideally the present and target levels of performance for each are estimated to help judge the possible costbenefit of pursuing each issue. An agreement on objectives, determination of constraints and resource requirements, and scheduling are then required followed by validation of the plan. A timely discussion is also presented on the rapid changes in the melt and calving rate of the Greenland ice sheet in response to equally rapid air and ocean temperature warming in the last decade, and the effects of these changes on sea ice and icebergs. These environmental changes directly affect both the Labrador Sea and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and are front and centre in the debate over global climate change.
