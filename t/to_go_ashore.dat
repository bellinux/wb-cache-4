5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore</b> by 7 June.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu Atoll {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there to refuel and take on supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore,</b> but regarded the sight of the tropical atoll as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Emden {{was serving}} as the {{flagship}} of Commodore Paul Heinrich, the commander of torpedo-boats assigned to Operation Albion. For the initial assault on 12 October, Emden was tasked with bombarding a Russian gun emplacement at Pamerort; Heinrich was given command of the landings there. At 06:08, Emden opened fire on the gun battery. Her first two salvos fell short, but the third hit and disabled the telephone wires and speaking tubes, which rendered central control of the Russian guns impossible. By 07:00, the Russian guns were silenced and German troops began <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore</b> unopposed. Two {{and a half hours}} later, a pair of Russian destroyers attempted to intervene, but Emden engaged them and drove them off.|$|E

5|$|The Mediterranean fleet was by {{now under}} Sir Edward Pellew, and Eyre {{was sent to}} the Spanish coast to support the Spanish forces {{fighting}} the French. Eyre was particularly active off the coast of Valencia and evacuated the garrison of Oropesa del Mar, earning the thanks of General Joaquín Blake y Joyes. On being ordered back to England in 1811 Pellew also wrote a private letter of thanks, following on from his earlier declaration that 'I have to express my complete approbation of Captain Eyre's methods, and have much satisfaction of employing the services of that most excellent officer in the aid of the Valencia patriots.' Eyre arrived in England in 1812, his health having been affected by his five years on a foreign station, and requested and received permission <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore.</b> As a mark of his services in the Adriatic and off Spain he was knighted by King George III. Eyre was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 4 June 1814 and was nominated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath following the expansion of the order on 12 January 1815.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{plan was}} for the 29th Division to land at Cape Helles {{on the tip of}} the peninsula and then advance upon the forts at Kilitbahir. The Anzacs were to land north of Gaba Tepe on the Aegean coast from where they could advance across the peninsula and prevent retreat from or reinforcement of Kilitbahir. The Anzac assault force, the 3rd Brigade of the Australian 1st Division, began <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore</b> shortly before dawn at 4:30 am on 25 April 1915. The intended landing zone was a broad front centred about a mile north of Gaba Tepe, however, possibly due to navigational error or an unexpected current, the landing went awry and the boats concentrated about {{a mile and a half}} further north than intended in a shallow, nameless cove between Ari Burnu to the north and Hell Spit to the south. Since 1985, the cove has been officially known as Anzac Koyu (Anzac Cove).|$|E

The shrewd Yankee captain, however, that night forced the sailors at the point of a pistol <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore.</b> He then speedily put to sea. Borica was very angry. Making the best of the situation, however, he put the men to work as carpenters and blacksmiths.|$|E

The crew manned the pumps until dawn, when they discovered that they were on the French shore, about three miles from Calais. As the tide rose, Jackal sank around 5 a.m., at which point the crew took to the rigging.

50|$|Catching puffins was a {{subsidiary}} {{source of income}} beside fishing. Catching puffins involved {{the use of the}} unusual puffin dog, also termed the Mostad dog or the Norwegian Lundehund.

All of them can be traced back <b>to</b> Mostad. <b>Going</b> <b>ashore</b> on Mostad is generally combined with a fishing trip or an expedition by boat to the bird cliffs.

Two midshipmen were also injured, and another lieutenant was locked below deck. The mutineers fled from the ship, but they soon were apprehended by the United States revenue cutter Jackson and placed in the New Orleans jail. Two of the mutinous sailors were returned to the ship, while the rest remained in New Orleans, pending extradition.|$|E
25|$|A poorly-armed Māori party led by chiefs {{including}} Ropata Wahawaha mounted {{an unsuccessful}} raid on Pai Mārire adherents at Mangaone, near Pukemaire, on 10 June 1865. After several more small engagements in the Waiapu Valley {{a delegation of}} east coast chiefs led by Mokena Kohere appealed to Donald McLean, the new Provincial Superintendent of Hawke's Bay, for arms and reinforcements to subdue the uprising. McLean immediately supplied Mokena with weapons and ammunition, then dispatched about 100 Colonial Defence Force troops under Major James Fraser. The HMS Eclipse landed the troops at Hicks Bay and {{at the mouth of}} the Waiapu River on 5 July 1865 in a bid to capture Kereopa and Patara, shelling their Hauhau enemy the next day. When a trading cutter following the troops anchored off Whakatane on 22 July to allow surveyor and government interpreter James Fulloon <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore</b> to investigate the local mood, it was boarded by Pai Mārire converts at the orders of Taranaki prophet Horomona.

25|$|On {{their journey}} back to Wu, the fleet passed by Baiwei (白圍), where Lu Xun {{announced}} {{that they would be}} getting off their vessels <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ashore</b> for a hunting expedition. However, he actually gave secret orders to his subordinates Zhou Jun (周峻) and Zhang Liang (張梁) to lead their men to attack Xinshi (新市), Anlu (安陸) and Shiyang (石陽) counties in Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡). Outside Shiyang County, the common people were going about their daily activities in the marketplace when Zhou Jun and his men showed up. The people immediately packed up everything and attempted to rush to safety behind the city walls. The Wei soldiers in Shiyang wanted to close the city gates but the civilians were blocking the way, so they killed some people and forced the gates to be shut. Zhou Jun and his men killed and captured over 1,000 civilians in Shiyang. The captives were resettled in Wu. Lu Xun gave orders to his men, forbidding them from harassing the people. Those captives who had their families with them were given due attention and care while those who lost their loved ones during the raid were provided with food and clothing and treated well before they were sent home. Many people were so touched by Lu Xun's acts of kindness that they decided to move to Wu territory. When news of Lu Xun's kindness spread to the neighbouring regions, two Wei officers, Zhao Zhuo (趙濯) and Fei Sheng (斐生), and a tribal king, Meiyi (梅頤), led their followers to join Lu Xun. Lu Xun generously distributed rewards to them.|$|E
