The development of CRDS was first reported by O’Keefe et al. in 1988. In 1999, Kerstel et al. successfully applied this technique to determine D/H in water sample. The system consists of a laser and a cavity equipped with high finesse reflectivity mirrors. Laser light is injected into the cavity, at which the resonance takes place due to the constructive interference. The laser then is turn off. The decay of light intensity is measured. In the presence of a water sample, the photo-absorption by water isotopologues follows the kinetic law. The optical spectrum is obtained by recording ring-down time of the H2O spectral features of interest at certain laser wavelength. The concentration of each isotopologue is proportional to the area under each measured isotopologue spectral feature.|$|E

The technique is related to conventional high-resolution laser spectroscopy for sensing and spectroscopy of gas (e.g. <b>tunable</b> <b>diode</b> laser absorption spectroscopy, TDLAS), {{but the fact that}} the gas here is [...] "hidden" [...] inside solid materials give rise to important differences.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric {{rectifying}} I-V behaviour of multiferroic BiFeO 3 (BFO) {{thin films}} grown on transparent ITO-coated glass was quantitatively studied {{as a function}} of ferroelectric polarization. Different polarized states were established by unipolar or bipolar poling with various applied electric fields. The effects of polarization relaxation and fatigue on the currents were also investigated. We found that the conduction currents and the associated rectifications were controlled by the amplitude and direction of the polarization. We clearly observed the linear dependence of the current on the polarization. It is suggested that the space-charge-limited conduction and the charge injection at the Schottky interface between the film and the electrodes dominate the current.

Laser absorption spectrometry has become the foremost used technique for quantitative assessments of atoms and molecules in gas phase. It is also a widely used technique for a variety of other applications, e.g. within the field of optical frequency metrology or in studies of light matter interactions.

50|$|Modulation {{techniques}} {{make use}} of the fact that technical noise usually decreases with increasing frequency (often referred to as a 1/f noise) and improves on the signal contrast by encoding and detecting the absorption signal at a high frequency, where the noise level is low. The most common modulation techniques, wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) and frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS), achieve this by rapidly scanning the frequency of the light across the absorbing transition. Both techniques have the advantage that the demodulated signal is low in the absence of absorbers but they are also limited by residual amplitude modulation, either from the laser or from multiple reflections in the optical system (etalon effects). The most frequently used laser-based technique for environmental investigations and process control applications is based upon diode lasers and WMS and often referred to as <b>tunable</b> <b>diode</b> laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). The typical sensitivity of WMS and FMS techniques is in the 10−5 range.|$|E

50|$|DFB {{laser diodes}} {{do not use}} two {{discrete}} mirrors to form the optical cavity (as they are used in conventional laser designs). The grating acts as the wavelength selective element {{for at least one}} of the mirrors and provides the feedback, reflecting light back into the cavity to form the resonator. The grating is constructed so as to reflect only a narrow band of wavelengths, and thus produce a single longitudinal lasing mode. This is in contrast to a Fabry-Perot Laser, where the facets of the chip form the two mirrors and provide the feedback. In that case, the mirrors are broadband and either the laser functions at multiple longitudinal modes simultaneously or easily jumps between longitudinal modes. Altering the temperature of the device causes the pitch of the grating to change due to the dependence of refractive index on temperature. This dependence is caused by a change in the semiconductor laser's bandgap with temperature and thermal expansion. A change in the refractive index alters the wavelength selection of the grating structure and thus the wavelength of the laser output, producing a wavelength tunable laser or TDL (<b>Tunable</b> <b>Diode</b> Laser). The tuning range is usually of the order of 6 nm for a ~50 K (90 °F) change in temperature, while the linewidth of a DFB laser is a few megahertz. Altering of the current powering the laser will also tune the device, as a current change causes a temperature change inside the device. Integrated DFB lasers are often used in optical communication applications, such as DWDM where a tunable laser signal is desired as well as in sensing where extreme narrow line width is required, or in gas sensing applications, where the signal of the absorbing gas is detected while wavelength tuning the DFB laser.|$|E
