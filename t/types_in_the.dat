5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum.

5|$|Soils in the San Juan {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} sedimentary rock and are highly erosive, resulting in large alluvial deposits along floodplains.

Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E

It then describes three dimensions of the mental health workforce that may influence quality of care, access to care, and costs of care: (1) licensure requirements and scope of practice for each provider <b>type</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mental health workforce, (2) estimated numbers of each provider <b>type</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mental health workforce, and (3) average annual wages for each provider <b>type</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mental health workforce. The report then briefly discusses how these dimensions of the mental health workforce might inform certain policy discussions...|$|R
5|$|Although {{multiple}} hypotheses {{exist on}} the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous wild horse origin is thought improbable, as significant numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800–1050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse <b>types</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell <b>types</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, {{with plans to}} increase {{the mass of the}} CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J <b>types</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E

Strandzha is the only place in Bulgaria where Alisoils are found and the only place in Europe with Nitisols.|$|E
5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite <b>types</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
