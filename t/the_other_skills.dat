The concept of mindfulness and the meditative exercises used to teach it are derived from traditional Buddhist practice, though the version taught in DBT does not involve any religious or metaphysical concepts. Within DBT it is the capacity to pay attention, nonjudgmentally, to the present moment; about living in the moment, experiencing one's emotions and senses fully, yet with perspective.|$|E

This is followed by a period of stagnation, followed by a phase in which a novel skill emerges which is more advanced than the others. This novel skill then pulls <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>skills</b> along with it in a phase called reversion. Then the process repeats itself with another stage of consolidation.

As a general rule the evening gowns are always custom-designed for each of the candidates on the final night, and always by a Venezuelan designer. By tradition, Nidal Nouaihed dresses the representatives of his home state of Zulia (Miss Costa Oriental, Miss Peninsula Goajira, Miss Zulia); Ángel Sanchez designs the gown for Miss Trujillo; Jose María Almeida designs the dress for Miss Mérida and the national costume for Miss Venezuela to Miss Universe. Only in 1999, 26 different designers took part of the evening gown competition, one candidate for each one. Also, in 2006, for the first time ever, the designers appeared on stage with the delegates, showing their fabulous creations.

40|$|The {{validity}} of certain standardized tests {{may be affected}} by the short-term memory load therein and its relation to a child's short-term memory capacity. Factors of testing which increase a test's memory load and consequently interfere with comprehension are discussed. It is hypothesized that a test which strains the short-term memory capacity of a child is functioning as an unintended screen to eliminate subjects with inferior memory capacities and does not adequately measure the intended ability. A number of tests randomly selected are examined in terms of three ways in which memory capacities can be overloaded in a test. In conclusion, since there {{does not appear to be}} a high correlation between memory skills and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>skills</b> involved in the learning processes, it is recommended that memory skills be measured as such and that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>skills</b> be assessed independently of the memory screen.

30|$|The {{correctness}} of {{this conclusion}} {{also depends on}} other factors (e.g., guessing or slipping; Roussos et al. 2007), mainly on a fundamentally diagnostic assessment model specified by the Q matrix. The importance of correctly specified Q matrices can be demonstrated by the following example of the “TOOL”-non-master: if a task’s skill-vector claims erroneously for “TOOL”, then obviously “TOOL” is not necessary for solving the task correctly; hence, the “TOOL”-non-master has—given he/she {{is a master of}} all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>skills</b> of the task’s skill vector—a high probability of solving this task correctly. Under the assumption of a correctly specified Q matrix, the “TOOL”-non-master shows an ambivalent response pattern concerning the skill “TOOL”.

Writing (as one of the four language skills – listening, speaking, reading and writing) has always been part of foreign language school curriculum and written communication is usually systematically practiced and developed. However, one of the key questions is how to teach students to write in a foreign language. It is vital to understand that writing (not only in a foreign language) has its specific features and aspects and is different from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>skills.</b> Its training and development requires a competent teacher and a prepared learner.
