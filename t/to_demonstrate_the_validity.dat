5|$|Stephen {{sought to}} ingratiate himself with Mehmed by sending out orders to commanders and castellans to surrender, {{enabling}} his captor to take command {{of more than}} 70 towns in one week. Mehmed, however, {{had no intention of}} sparing Stephen's life and summoned him on 25 May. Stephen fearfully brought Angelović's document, but Mehmed's Persian-born mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a fatwah declaring that the Sultan was not bound to keep the promise made by his servant without his knowledge. As if <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of his fatwah, the elderly mullah took out his sword and beheaded Stephen in front of Mehmed.

According to later accounts, Mehmed had Stephen flayed or used as a shooting target. The execution of the King, his uncle, cousin and two noblemen took place in a field next to Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje ("the Emperor's Field").|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{large-scale}} efforts dedicated to comprehensive phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, several relationships among mammalian orders remain controversial. Here, we present an extensive application of retroposon (L 1) insertion analysis to the phylogenetic relationships among almost all mammalian orders. In addition <b>to</b> <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of Glires, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, and Boreoeutheria, we demonstrate an interordinal clade that links Chiroptera, Carnivora, and Perissodactyla within Laurasiatheria. Re-examination {{of a large}} DNA sequence data set yielded results consistent with our conclusion. We propose a superordinal name “Pegasoferae” for this clade of Chiroptera + Perissodactyla + Carnivora + Pholidota. The presence of a single incongruent L 1 locus generates a tree in which the group of Carnivora + Perissodactyla associates with Cetartiodactyla but not with Chiroptera. This result suggests that incomplete lineage sorting of an ancestral dimorphism occurred {{with regard to the}} presence or absence of retroposon alleles in a common ancestor of Scrotifera (Pegasoferae + Cetartiodactyla), which was followed by rapid divergence into the extant orders over an evolutionarily short period. Accordingly, Euungulata (Cetartiodactyla + Perissodactyla) and Fereuungulata (Carnivora + Pholidota + Perissodactyla + Cetartiodactyla) cannot be validated as natural groups.
