5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, <b>the</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent {{a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer.

On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E
