50|$|At present, {{the group}} have {{completed}} ballast laying {{over the first}} mile from the junction with the GCR to Wood Lane. On 10 May 2010, the track work began with the placement of a right-handed point at Swithland Sidings, {{the first part of}} the new junction. In June, the group received a £5000 donation from the Great Central's support charity, bringing them closer to their goal to complete the track laying. An ex-British Railways AC Cars railbus, which has been stored at the back of Loughborough since 2006, is also planned to be restored for use on the branch and the rest of the railway in general, with work due to start as soon as enough money has been raised. Work is due to continue as finances allow and the group are currently looking for more <b>track,</b> <b>sleepers</b> and fittings for the branch.|$|E
50|$|By 2010 little {{remained}} of the railway although aerial photographs clearly show sections {{of the right of}} way (ROW) to the west and north-west of Landsborough, today located in the Pyrenees Shire. Those track lines not left to nature were originally replaced with gravel roads, some of which were later asphalted such as the Tulkara - Navarre Road. Stations, such as Tulkara and Crowlands remain as little more than mounds of earth by the roadside with the scattered remnants of <b>track</b> <b>sleepers,</b> and mounds of ballast, the only clue as to what may have been there. The terminus at Ben Nevis, just 100 meters or so off the Pyrenees Highway, exists only as a couple of weather beaten railway crossing signs on a dirt road which crosses the disused Ararat to Avoca rail line. At Navarre, ground works suggesting a railway servicing area, loading ramp and weighbridge pit bear testament to the grand ideals local businessmen had for the area.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBallasted <b>track</b> <b>sleepers</b> {{have the}} {{important}} function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance of sleepers, rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance of sleepers. In view of the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance of sleepers. Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types of concrete sleepers. The results of the pullout tests revealed the effects of the sleeper shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number of sleepers on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance of sleepers is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Korea Train eXpress (KTX) is {{now being}} operated, which allows Korea {{being one of the}} {{countries}} that operates the high-speed rail system. The high-speed rail has its advantage of short time transportation of population and materials, which lead to many researches performed in this matter. In the case of high speed classical trackbed system, the maintenance and usability of gravel ballast system is costly. Recently, the concrete trackbed structure has been introduced as a replacement of classical trackbed system. In this case, the sleeper plays a critical role. Current study investigated to develop the <b>track</b> <b>sleepers</b> readily applicable {{to the top of the}} asphalt trackbed, as part of the trcakbed study utilizing the asphalt material. Among many possible shapes and design of sleepers, current study proposed two types of wide-sleepers according to the shear-key installation method.

40|$|Nowadays {{increasing}} use of {{high strength}} concrete (HSC) in construction industry has prompted the need to understand clearly its behaviour. One or {{the application of the}} high strength concrete beam (HSC) is the railway industry as the railway <b>track</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Therefore, this study will be concentrated on the behaviour of high strength concrete beam under half sine impulse load with respect to static loading and dynamic loading. Three numbers of high strength concrete (HSC) beam of size 125 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are casted with four nos. longitudinal reinforcement (bottom 2 T 16 and top 2 R 6) together with R 6 stirrup at 80 mm c/c spacing is mixed and cured as BS 1881. The concrete grade 60 N/mnr is used. One of the beam is tested under 4 point static load test until failure while the remaining two are tested under dynamic load test with minimum load of 50 % of yield load and maximum load of 60 % yield load. Half sine impulse load under 4 point test is applied for 3 millions and 5 millions with the frequency of 10 hertz. Due to the availability of testing machine, load control is used. Concrete strength of 60 N/mm 2 was achieve from the cube test to show that the concrete mix for high strength concrete is meet. The static test gaves the Young's modulus of 33. 810 kN/mm 2. In the dynamic test, rapid increase in deflection, crack mouth opening and crack length for the both beam cases. There is a loss in stiffness of the beam due to loss of gripping force between concrete and reinforcement. It seem that the response of the beam in term of deflection, crack mouth and crack length is not great during further application of load cycles...|$|E

40|$|Railways are {{integral}} to the transportation system of a growing economy. There is a constant demand by numerous stakeholders of the railway industry for greater train operational speeds, tonnage, passenger comfort and safety with minimal service disruptions. This is partly achievable through {{the improvement of the}} main components of railway track. A fundamental requirement for any railway track {{is to be able to}} maintain its as-built geometry over its service life. Settlement of a ballasted railway track is mainly caused by cyclic loading due to the passage of traffic. To return the rail track to the as-built alignment and level, track maintenance needs to be carried out. Tamping is one of the most common and traditional ways of maintaining the track and is not only costly but causes interruption to the day-to-day operations and damages the long term performance of the ballasted track. It therefore remains important to policy makers, rail practitioners and researchers to identify new techniques, innovations or processes that will prolong intervals between scheduled track maintenance. Track settlement is influenced by several interrelated track variables, not least of which are the railway sleeper, ballast and ballast-sleeper interface that have potential for alteration to be optimised with respect to the track performance. In this research, results are presented from a parametric experimental study using three different apparatus namely box test (confined), Composite Element Test (CET) (semi-confined), and Railway Test Facility (RTF) (full-scale), to investigate performance of different sleeper and ballast configurations. The box test and the CET apparatus were used ahead of the RTF (full-scale) apparatus as preliminary tests to obtain an insight into the performance and potential benefits of different sleeper types with and without the use of Under Sleeper Pads (USPs). The aforementioned apparatus were also used for comparison with the full-scale apparatus to assess the consistency of the sleeper settlement results (phase 1 tests). The purpose of using the box test and CET apparatus was also to allow a relatively large number of simplified tests to be carried out on sleeper and ballast combinations (Phase 2 tests) within a reasonable cost and time frame. Phase 2 tests were designed and conducted with consideration of the phase 1 test results. The test results from phase 1 showed that increasing the number of contact points between ballast particles and sleeper, and increasing the coefficient of friction at ballast-sleeper interface improved the settlement performance of the tarckbed. Therefore, having this in mind, further tests were designed and conducted including: finer ballast grading, two-layered ballast systems, frictional sleepers and USPs, and USP types with various stiffnesses. In addition, further tests on ballast bonding/gluing and ballast reinforcement were conducted with the aim of investigating possible ways of minimising ballast bed deterioration. Application of ballast gluing was proven beneficial (in literature) in improving ballast bed performance, however, the overall cost of super glues used for this method was high. Therefore in this study, a low cost glue was introduced and its performance was tested under conditions similar to real track. With regard to ballast reinforcement, the expanded polystyrene was added to the ballast sample with the aim of decreasing the contact forces between ballast particles and consequently minimising ballast bed deterioration and settlement. The observations in this study sought to establish qualitative and quantitative data on the effects of different parameters on the track performance, which may lead to a longer service life with less maintenance. The results showed that the type of sleeper has an influence on the performance of a railway track. With respect to settlement performance of a railway <b>track,</b> <b>sleepers</b> with higher depth and width, coefficient friction, and bending stiffness performed better. Out of all investigated sleeper types without any additional interventions, concrete mono-block gave the least settlement and the plastic sleeper gave the most. It was also found that inclusion of USPs (regardless of type) can be beneficial compared to the ‘no USP’ scenario in: (1) Increasing trackbed resiliency. (2) Reducing maintenance works related to settlement. (3) Reducing sleeper deflections (hogging) at the middle of sleeper. (4) Reducing the rate of deterioration of sleeper support at the rail seat (6) Reducing differences in the performance of different sleeper types. (7) Reducing tendency towards centre binding. (8) Reducing transmitted pressure on subgrade. (9) Making the trackbed stiffness more uniform. The conclusion of research was that use of concrete mono-block sleeper, USPs, finer ballast grading, a two-layered ballast system with finer ballast grading on top, frictional sleeper, frictional USP, and ballast gluing all have potential to improve the performance of ballasted railway track and reduce the maintenance requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{classic and}} {{reinforced}} railway track {{is composed of}} two infinite rails separated from sleepers by visco-elastic pads. There are numerous assumptions leading to different simplifications in railway track modelling. The rails are modelled as infinite Timoshenko beams, sleepers by lumped masses or elastic bodies and ballast as a visco-elastic foundation. Nowadays the interest of engineers {{is focused on the}} Y-shaped sleepers. The fundamental qualitative difference between the track with classic or Y sleepers is related to local longitudinal symmetric or antymetric features of railway <b>track.</b> The <b>sleeper</b> spacing influences the periodicity of elastic foundation coefficient, mass density (rotational inertia) and shear effective rigidity. The track with classical concrete sleepers is influenced much more by rotational inertia and shear deflections than the <b>track</b> with Y <b>sleepers.</b> The increase of elastic wave velocity in <b>track</b> with Y <b>sleepers</b> and more uniform load distribution will be proved by the analysis and simulations. The analytical and numerical analysis allows us to evaluate the track properties in a range of moderate and high speed train.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, a {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been paid to the analysis of failure modes occurring in railway infrastructure assets, e. g. bridges, rail <b>tracks,</b> <b>sleepers,</b> etc. However, there have been few attempts by researchers to develop failure criticality assessment models for railway rolling stock. A rolling stock failure may be very costly in terms of monetary loss and/or passenger inconvenience. It may also cause delays to train services or even result in catastrophic derailment accidents. In this paper, a failure mode, effects and criticality analysis approach is presented to identify, analyse and evaluate the causes and consequences of rolling stock failures. The most critical failure modes with respect to both reliability and economics are identified and potential protective measures are then proposed to prevent their recurrence. For the purpose of illustrating the proposed approach, the model is applied to a rolling stock passenger door system. The data required for the study are collected from both the literature and the maintenance information system available in a Scottish train operating company. The results of this study can be used to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance programme for different components of rolling stock...|$|R
