2500|$|Homer and Bart {{participate}} at an [...] "Ugliest Dog" [...] {{contest in}} Springfield" [...] contest, entering Santa's Little Helper. At the contest, Moe feels neglected because {{nobody wants to}} let him sit next to them (Agnes Skinner even sets <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her on fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much {{to the delight of}} the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.|$|E

60|$|Ellerby {{took off}} his pads, and dropped into <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mike's. Mike was silent and thoughtful. He was in after Bob, and {{to be on the}} eve of batting does not make one conversational.|$|E
60|$|Bessy either {{forgot to}} {{introduce}} her escort {{or did not}} care to. She nodded a dismissal to him, spoke sweetly to Blair, and then took <b>the</b> empty <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Lane.|$|R

50|$|Arthur Wilson (Eric Idle), a young mountaineer, {{visits the}} office of Sir George Head, OBE (John Cleese), who is leading an {{expedition}} to Mount Kilimanjaro. Head's problem, though, {{is that he has}} a bad case of diplopia, and indeed, he believes there are two Wilsons when he enters the office. He must cover his right eye to confirm Wilson's claim that there's only one of him. Head begins filling in Wilson's application, although he repeatedly asks both Wilson and <b>the</b> empty <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him <b>the</b> same question.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you about that, sir," [...] said he, resting his foot on <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> mine. [...] "Did you ever have anybody hand you a double handful of good luck while both your hands was full of bad luck, and stop to notice how your fingers behaved?" ...|$|E
60|$|Duncombe glanced around. The man {{had taken}} <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> them, and was evidently {{prepared}} {{to listen to}} all that was said. His clothes and bearing, and quiet, unobtrusive manners, all seemed to suggest truthfully enough his possible identity--an English detective from an advertised office. Duncombe smiled as he realized the almost pitiful inadequacy of such methods.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fear that}} I am {{a few moments}} late," [...] he remarked, as he took <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Foston Rowe. [...] "I offer you my apologies, Captain. I congratulate you upon your library. I have {{discovered}} a most interesting book upon the habits of seagulls. It kept me engrossed until the very last moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop here!" [...] {{broke in}} an irascible-looking gentleman in a grey tweed suit {{who was sitting}} in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> mine. [...] "Do they stop here? I should say they did indeed. Don't you know," [...] he added, turning to the Pullman conductor, [...] "that any train is {{compelled}} to stop here. There's a by-law, a municipal by-law of the City of Toronto, compelling every train to stop?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Philip Lefrank, {{this is my}} overlooker, Mr. Jago," [...] {{said the}} old man, {{formally}} presenting us. [...] "John Jago, this is my young relative by marriage, Mr. Lefrank. He is not well; he has come over the ocean for rest, and change of scene. Mr. Jago is an American, Philip. I hope you have no prejudice against Americans. Make acquaintance with Mr. Jago. Sit together." [...] He cast another dark look at his sons; and the sons again returned it. They pointedly drew back from John Jago as he approached <b>the</b> empty <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me and moved round {{to the opposite side}} of the table. It was plain that the man with the beard stood high in the father's favor, and that he was cordially disliked for that or for some other reason by the sons.|$|R
60|$|After {{finding that}} they could both speak English, the two boys talked with each other like old friends, for some minutes; and at length finding that the pillar between them {{was very much in}} the way, Charles, with his mother's permission, moved his seat round to Rollo's side of it, Rollo himself moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>to</b> make room for him. Mrs. Beekman readily consented to this, having first {{observed}} that Rollo appeared to be a boy of agreeable and gentlemanly manners and demeanor.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was thus}} that Sir Gregory {{regarded}} the matter. 'See all that I {{have done for}} this man,' said he to himself; 'see how I have warmed him in my bosom, how I have lifted him to fortune and renown, how I have heaped benefits on his head! If gratitude in this world be possible, that man should be grateful to me; if one man can ever have another's interest at heart, that man should have a heartfelt anxiety as to my interest. And yet how is it? I have placed him in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> my own, {{and now he is}} desirous of sitting above me!' ...|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} he wandered through snow-rutted streets {{of which he}} had never heard, streets of small tenements and two-family houses and marooned cottages. It came to him that he had nothing to do, that there was nothing he wanted to do. He was bleakly lonely in the evening, when he dined by himself at the Regency Hotel. He sat in the lobby afterward, in a plush chair bedecked with the Saxe-Coburg arms, lighting a cigar and looking for some one who would come and play with him and save him from thinking. In <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him (showing the arms of Lithuania) was a half-familiar man, a large red-faced man with pop eyes and a deficient yellow mustache. He seemed kind and insignificant, and as lonely as Babbitt himself. He wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange tie.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} who sat in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me, how {{carefully}} he wrapped the cloak round {{the shoulders of the}} little milliner beside him. And when she said she was tired of sitting still, how readily he sprang from his chair to walk with her, though it was evident he was very comfortable where he was. And she! She had laughed at his jokes; they were not very clever jokes, they were not very new. She had probably read them herself months before in her own particular weekly journal. Yet the harmless humbug made him happy. I wonder if ten years hence she will laugh at such old humour, if ten years hence he will take such clumsy pains to put her cape about her. Experience shakes her head, and is amused at my question.|$|E

She wears a patterned dress and a headscarf, and faces the camera sitting on a wooden <b>chair.</b> <b>The</b> caption <b>next</b> <b>to</b> this image reads: "Grace - a very good worker - Aro Chuku church 1943.

40|$|Vividly tinted {{lantern slide}} showing a posed group of native Congolese with {{male and female}} European missionaries. Most of the Congolese sit on the ground - those sitting wear {{traditional}} dress. A few Congolese men wear Western suits, and sit or stand {{to the side of}} the main group, or stand at the back of the image behind a small group of missionaries. They may be native evangelists or Christain converts. Two European female missionaries sit to the side of <b>the</b> group on <b>chairs</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a native evangelist, and two male missionaries sit to the backk of a group, behind a clothed table. This slide comes from a collection generated by missionaries working for the Congo Balolo Mission, a mission begun in 1889 under the supervision of the East London Training Institute for Home and Foreign Missions that developed into the interdenominational evangelical mission Regions Beyond Missionary Union after 1900...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2004 {{episode of}} the {{television}} series MythBusters, {{an attempt was made}} to recreate Wan Hu's flight using materials that would have been available to him. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> exploded on <b>the</b> launch pad, with the crash test dummy showing what would be severe burns. An attempt was also made using a chair with modern rockets attached; however, the uncontrollable craft proved that there were far too many complications for such a thing to have succeeded. It was determined that small rockets that can be strapped to a chair cannot provide sufficient thrust to effectively lift it, giving the legend the label of myth [...] "busted". The view the crew members had of the first test as it was performed matched what the legend said; after the smoke from the explosion had cleared, both Buster (the crash-test dummy) and <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> had disappeared, though Buster and the remains of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> were found <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 'launch-pad'.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the house}} {{now for the first}} time, and I saw {{something}} which pleased me very little. We were immediately opposite the Royal box, which, with the one adjoining, was occupied by a very brilliant little party. The Archduchess was there. It was she whose lorgnettes were still unfalteringly directed towards Isobel. Lady Delahaye sat in the background, and a greater personage than either occupied <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Archduchess. Soon I saw that they were all whispering together, all still looking from Isobel towards the stage, and from the stage to Isobel; and in the background was a man whose coat was covered with orders, and who held himself like a soldier. He looked at Isobel as one might look at a ghost. I stood back almost hidden in the shadows, and I wondered more than ever what the end of all these things might be.|$|E
60|$|The Duchesse, {{save that}} she was tall and wrapped in {{magnificent}} furs, presented a somewhat mysterious appearance. Her features were entirely obscured by an unusually thick veil of black lace, and the voluminous nature of her outer garments only permitted a suspicion as to her figure, which was, at that time, at once the despair and the triumph of her corsetiere. With both hands she was holding her fur-lined skirts from contact with the deck, disclosing {{at the same time}} remarkably shapely feet encased in trim patent shoes with plain silver buckles, and a little more black silk stocking than seemed absolutely necessary. The deck steward, after a half-puzzled scrutiny of the labels, let down <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the two men. The Duchesse contemplated her prospective neighbors with some curiosity, mingled {{with a certain amount of}} hesitation. It was at that moment that Sogrange, shaking away his rug, rose to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|When Michel {{entered the}} room he at once looked round for Marie. There she was {{standing}} at the soup-tureen {{with her back to the}} company. But he could see that there hung down some ribbon from her waist, that her frock was not the one she had worn in the morning, and that in the article of her attire she had kept her word with him. He was very awkward. When one of the old ladies was about to seat herself in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Adrian--in preparation for which it must be admitted that Marie had made certain wicked arrangements--Michel first by signs and afterwards with audible words, intended to be whispered, indicated to the lady that she was required to place herself elsewhere. This was hard upon the lady, as her own table-napkin and a cup out of which she was wont to drink were placed at that spot. Marie, standing at the soup-tureen, heard it all and became very spiteful. Then her uncle called to her: ...|$|E
6000|$|My wife, being {{still the}} bride on this occasion, had the honour of being {{led to the}} dinner-table by our banker and host. Lord Highgate was {{reserved}} for Mrs. Hobson, who, in an engaging manner, requested poor Clive to conduct his cousin Maria to dinner, handing over Miss Ethel to another guest. Our Major gave his arm to Lady Clara, and I perceived that my wife looked very grave as he passed {{the place where she}} sat, and seated Lady Clara in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> that which Lord Highgate chanced to occupy. Feeling himself en vein, and the company being otherwise rather mum and silent, my uncle told a number of delightful anecdotes about the beau-monde of his time, about the Peninsular war, the Regent, Brummell, Lord Steyne, Pea Green Payne, and so forth. He said the evening was very pleasant, though some others of the party, as it appeared to me, scarcely seemed to think so. Clive had not a word for his cousin Maria, but looked across the table at Ethel all dinner-time. What could Ethel have to say to her partner, old Colonel Sir Donald M'Craw, who gobbled and drank, as his wont is, and if he had a remark to make, imparted it to Mrs. Hobson, at whose right hand he was sitting, and to whom, during the whole course, or courses, of the dinner, my Lord Highgate scarcely uttered one single word? ...|$|R

60|$|I {{walked to}} a point from where I could command the {{southern}} approaches to the bridge, my colleague arriving sometimes by way of Birdcage Walk and sometimes {{by way of the}} Horse Guards Parade. Not seeing any signs of him {{in the direction of the}} bridge, I turned back. A little way past the chair where the lady was sitting I met Mr. Parable. I know Mr. Parable quite well by sight. He was wearing the usual grey suit and soft felt hat with which the pictures in the newspapers have made us all familiar. I judged that Mr. Parable had come from the Houses of Parliament, and the next morning my suspicions were confirmed by reading that he had been present at a tea-party given on the terrace by Mr. Will Crooks. Mr. Parable conveyed to me the suggestion of a man absorbed in thought, and not quite aware of what he was doing; but in this, of course, I may have been mistaken. He paused for a moment to look over the railings at the pelican. Mr. Parable said something to the pelican which I was not near enough to overhear; and then, still apparently in a state of abstraction, crossed the path and seated himself on <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> that occupied by the young lady.|$|E
60|$|Of late he {{had thought}} more {{frequently}} than usual of his past days in the Community. His mind went back again now to that bygone time. The clock on the mantelpiece struck nine. They were all at supper, at Tadmor--talking over {{the events of the}} day. He saw himself again at the long wooden table, with shy little Mellicent in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him, and his favourite dog at his feet waiting to be fed. Where was Mellicent now? It was a sad letter that she had written to him, with the strange fixed idea that he was to return to her one day. There was something very winning and lovable about the poor creature who had lived such a hard life at home, and had suffered so keenly. It was a comfort to think that she would go back to the Community. What happier destiny could she hope for? Would she take care of his dog for him when she went back? They had all promised to be kind to his pet animals in his absence; but the dog was fond of Mellicent; he would be happier with Mellicent than with the rest of them. And his little tame fawn, and his birds--how were they doing? He had not even written to inquire after them; he had been cruelly forgetful of those harmless dumb loving friends. In his present solitude, in his dreary doubts of the future, what would he not give to feel the dog nestling in his bosom, and the fawn's little rough tongue licking his hand! His heart ached as he thought of it: a choking hysterical sensation oppressed his breathing. He tried to rise, and ring for lights, and rouse his manhood to endure and resist. It was not to be done. Where was his courage? where was the cheerfulness which had never failed him at other time? He sank back in the chair, and hid {{his face in his hands}} for shame at his own weakness, and burst out crying.|$|E

5000|$|He also chided Rice for clashing with White House {{advisers}} on {{the tone}} of the president's speeches on Iraq and said that she, as the Secretary of State, ruefully conceded to him that the Bush administration should not have apologized for a claim the president made in his 2003 State of the Union address, on Saddam's supposed search for yellowcake uranium.

5000|$|If {{you can put}} {{yourself}} in my position - I’m 29 years old, I know I’ve got cancer, I think it’s confined to my abdomen so I’m expecting to have an operation, maybe some chemotherapy and possibly a cure. I’m in a side room. I can hear everything that’s going on outside. I’m in pain and alone. A junior doctor comes to see {{me to talk to}} me about the results of the MRI scan I’d had earlier in the week. I’d never met this doctor before. He came into my room, he sat down in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me and looked away from me. Without any warning or asking if I wanted anyone with me he just said, “Your cancer has spread”. He then could not leave the room quick enough and I was left in deep psychological distress. I never saw him again. I am a little bit psychologically scarred by that experience.|$|E
