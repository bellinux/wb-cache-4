Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car.

25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I can assure you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all {{in his power to}} save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

[...] In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form.

[...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams. [...] Although Dewar would later become a supporter of the Labour Party, after Churchill was passed over for a cabinet position in 1931 Dewar wrote to him on 16 November, [...] "I am very sorry to see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in the new Cabinet.

I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what inspired {{me to do something}} for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology.

500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told you that you have to prove it... <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, prove to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I {{think a lot of}} Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
500|$|There was no {{nationwide}} {{election day}} in 1840, and many states, {{by the time}} they held the presidential vote, had already conducted balloting in local races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a popular vote for president, with electors chosen by the legislature. These state and federal elections, from March to October 1840, led to Whig victories in all but a few states, mainly Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire. Among the victories was that of Whig Governor-elect Corwin in Ohio. The first presidential balloting began on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the polls ended with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the largest polling day, as 12 states, including New York, voted. As those states compiled the vote, citizens scanned partisan and unreliable newspapers, trying to discern a trend. Even though Harrison led in 10 of the first 11 states to report, former president Jackson wrote to Van Buren, [...] "do not believe a word of it. Nor will I believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> elected until I see all the official returns." [...] But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, it was clear that Harrison and Tyler had won the election.|$|E

500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France."

500|$|... "The Party Song" [...] was {{inspired}} by when Hoppus attended a [...] "jock-infested" [...] party at San Diego State University and met some students who thought highly of themselves. Disinterested in the party, he felt he would much rather be at home, which {{found its way into}} the song's lyrics. [...] "Mutt" [...] was written by DeLonge for his friend Benji Weatherly and his appearance in the Taylor Steele surf video The Show. An early version of [...] "Mutt", with Scott Raynor behind the drum kit, was recorded with producer Mark Trombino and appears on the film's 1998 soundtrack. The title of [...] "Wendy Clear" [...] comes from Hoppus' boat, named [...] "Wendy," [...] and how boaters end transmissions by letting other boaters know the channel is open for use, or [...] "clear". Hoppus wrote the song while on tour with MxPx about having a crush on [...] "someone <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> supposed to like." [...] Lastly, [...] "Anthem," [...] the final song on Enema of the State, is about being trapped in the suburbs, longing for freedom and the age of 21. It is based on when DeLonge was in high school and told his peers that his band would be playing at a friend's house. The party was later busted by the police and a [...] "giant fight broke out." [...] Hoppus felt it a perfect summary of the album's themes: [...] "lots of youthful angst, energy, and suburban unrest." ...|$|E
