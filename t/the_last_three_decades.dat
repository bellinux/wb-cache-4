Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E

5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years.

In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>decade,</b> nitride based coatings have been widely applied as hard wear-protective coatings in mechanical components.

This study describes the microstructural, mechanical and compositional stability of nano-crystalline Cr-N and nano-composited Ti-N based coatings (Ti-Al-Si-B-N and Ti-Cr-B-N) after air and vacuum annealing. For Cr-N coatings annealing in vacuum induces phase transformation from CrN to Cr 2 N, while after annealing in air only Cr 2 O 3 phase is present. For Ti-N based coatings, a well-definite multilayered structure was shown after air annealing. Degradation of mechanical properties was observed for all the nitride coatings after thermal annealing in air. 1...|$|R

We aimed to capture key health indicators and demographic data from Qatar and GCC countries by examining 1980 - 2010 data from the World Bank Databank and WHO report. The results highlighted a unique demographic profile in Qatar, which has the lowest age dependency ratio, highest male to female ratio, and second highest migrant population in the world. In comparison to other GCC countries, Qatar had the highest life expectancy and the lowest communicable disease and-all cause mortality rates. The GCC countries generally had a low percentage of their population over age 65, a high percentage of migrants, a very low crude death rate and very high overweight and obesity prevalence.

40|$|The electrodeless plasma {{discharge}} is typically driven by radio frequency (RF) power supply {{within the range}} (0. 2 ¡ 40 MHz).

RF ICP technique has achieved significance importance in a diversity of research and industrial applications for over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>threes</b> <b>decades.</b> It is still required to undertake both theoretical and experimental research. In this work, RF ICP technique is applied on the torch modeling in 2 D. Based on extended electromagnetic vector potential representation, an axisymmetric model in 2 D is proposed for the calculations of the electromagnetic fields in an RF ICP torch. The influence of axial vector potential is included to the vector potential formulations. This is achieved by imposing a helical current carrying wire configuration. The corresponding governing equations are solved numerically by applying finite element method (FEM) using commercial partial differential equation solver (Flex PDE 3). Based on this model, the plasma behavior and properties are examined in terms of plasma parameters. Besides, a comparativ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Water {{quality and}} metal {{contents}} of sediments were measured in Zayandeh-Rood River. Zayandeh-Rood {{is one of}} the most important rivers of Iran. The river water is used for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes. The anthropogenic impact on the river over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>decade</b> has proven to be extremely negative due to the quick development of industry. Physico-chemical parameters of water were measured in study area. Total concentration of metals was measured in bulk sediment samples (0 - 5 cm). Study of water parameters indicated BOD and COD values are more than surface water quality standards in some segments. Sediments analysis revealed some metals accumulation is very close to normal and some beyond threshold limits. Comparing with the maximum background values indicates river is polluted in central segmentation. Higher concentrations of elements were observed in sampling location 4 and 5. Lead was the highest in terms of contamination level, especially after Zarin-Shahr effluents, followed by Nickel. Results indicated the origin of Lead was mainly anthropogenic and for others was lithogenic. I poll Index values indicated a non-polluted and less-polluted environment throughout the river. I poll values are in a well agreement with results of chemical partitioning of metals...|$|R
