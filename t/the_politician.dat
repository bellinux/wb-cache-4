5|$|As president, John Quincy Adams had {{previously}} disallowed {{trade between the}} United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following {{the passage of the}} 1827 hurricane, <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win the presidency a year later.|$|E

5|$|Lygon's successor, <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> Rufus Isaacs, the Marquess of Reading, {{became the}} Lord Warden in 1934, holding jovial family gatherings there. His wife, Stella, {{attempted}} to restore Wellington's old bedroom to its earlier appearance during the Duke's tenure and, {{as part of}} this project, the 4th Duke of Wellington agreed to send the original contents of the room back to the castle, where they still remain. <b>The</b> <b>politician</b> Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon, became Lord Warden in 1936, followed by Sir Winston Churchill who followed him in 1941 during the Second World War. Churchill noted to the Minister of Works and Buildings that he had told King George V on taking up the position that he doubted that {{he would be able to}} live at Walmer Castle during the war, as it was within range of the German artillery along the French coast, or indeed that he would able to afford to live there afterwards, and for that reason he hoped that the state would maintain the castle and gardens, and decide what use it should be put to after the war.|$|E

50|$|At {{this time}} <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> {{were divided into}} two {{opposing}} political parties: the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|Conscription was {{introduced}} in Canada during {{the final years of}} the war, which was accompanied by labour shortages, pressures for social change, and the rapid unionisation of the remaining workforce. While concerns about the Central Powers declined, fears grew in government at the end of 1918 that the new Bolshevik government in Russia might be covertly orchestrating a campaign of strikes across Canada. In response the Prime Minister, Robert Borden, created a Public Safety Branch led by <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> Charles Cahan. Cahan envisaged transforming this organisation into a much larger secret service, similar to the Bureau of Investigation in the United States, but he soon fell out with Borden and ultimately resigned.|$|E
5|$|During his {{period in}} Berlin, {{he came in}} contact with and was greatly {{influenced}} by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Gans, and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke, whose ideas on the necessity for politicians to be acquainted with historical science he readily adopted. In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu's stay. He commented that, in later years, <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations.|$|E
40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the differences between}} the arguments coming from <b>the</b> local <b>politicians</b> and <b>the</b> national ones, and how the distribution of power is made between them and who actually got most to say.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{interviews}} with politicians on TV. It describes how <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> do not always give a straight {{answer to the question}} asked by the interviewer. Furthermore it looks into what it takes for the interviewer to get good arguments out of <b>the</b> <b>politicians.</b> <b>The</b> thesis analyses six interviews on two news programs on the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. As analytical tools it uses Stephen Toulmins model for good arguments as well as theory on interviews. The thesis concludes that <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> in fact do use various techniques to avoid answering the questions asked by the interviewer. In many cases this could have been avoided though if the interviewer had phrased her question in a better way. The thesis all in all concludes that there is room for improvement for both <b>politicians</b> and interviewers. <b>The</b> interviewers need to ask better questions and show more presence during the interviews because this enables them to act when <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> try to avoid answering a critical question. <b>The</b> <b>politicians</b> on <b>the</b> other hand are too scared of saying something which will hit the headlines the next day that they often avoid saying anything meaningful at all...|$|R

5|$|During the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart stormed Dunrobin Castle without warning, {{because the}} Clan Sutherland {{supported}} the British government. The 17th Earl of Sutherland, who {{had changed his}} surname from Gordon to Sutherland, narrowly escaped them, exiting through a back door. He sailed for Aberdeen where he joined the Duke of Cumberland's army. On {{the death of the}} 18th Earl in 1766, the house passed to his daughter, Elizabeth, who married <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> George Leveson-Gower, later created 1st Duke of Sutherland. In 1785, the house was altered and extended again.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. <b>The</b> <b>politician</b> and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Pilcher married Kathleen Mary Gonne, {{daughter}} of Colonel Thomas Gonne of the 17th Lancers; her sister, Maude Gonne, {{later became a}} prominent Irish nationalist and mother of <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> and Nobel laureate Seán MacBride, {{as well as a}} close associate and muse of W. B. Yeats. Pilcher disapproved of his sister-in-law, particularly after her marriage to John MacBride, and relations were frequently strained; however, the two sisters remained close. The couple would have a daughter, Thora, and three sons – Toby, Tommy, and Pat. The elder son, Gonne ("Toby", to his family), became a Judge of the High Court of Justice, while Tommy would be killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, aged 21.|$|E

He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

This enrages Bhope, who orders his men to kill Guddu and return Sweety to his house so he can arrange a marriage for her. Sweety fights off her brother's henchmen and escapes with Guddu.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans were not to be trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
