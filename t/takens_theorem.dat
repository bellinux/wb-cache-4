To evaluate the results, the proposed multivariate chaotic time series predictor based on multivariate local polynomial model is compared with a univariate predictor with the same numerical data. The simulation results obtained by the Lorenz system show that the prediction mean squares error of the multivariate predictor is much smaller than the univariate one, and is much better than the existing three methods.

3000|$|Attractors are {{geometric}} structures {{described by}} the system in its evolution. These geometric shapes attract all the orbits starting from different initial conditions, hence the name attractors. These shapes can be discovered by using state space or phase space mapping. A phase space represents a graphic backdrop for presenting the motion of time-based data (Kiel and Elliott 1997 : 27). We construct a XY graph and place on the horizontal axis or abscissa the observed values xt and on the vertical axis or ordinates the same values measured with time delays or xt−n delayed by 1, 2,… 3, and so on time lags. The most suitable time lag for reconstructing the attractor is found by experiments. Usually, however, it is set at equal 1. The values xt and xt−n constitute the coordinates of a point on a multidimensional space, and the set of points identified in this way describe an orbit which {{in the long run}} traces the typical attractor of the observed system.

40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work of Packard et al. and Takens {{it has become}} customary to reconstruct the topology of attractors in phase space from a time series of one-dimensional experimental observations by using delay coordinates. Many practical refinements of the original methods have been developed. Many experimental systems possess symmetry, and bifurcations can cause changes in the symmetry of observed states. These changes are quite subtle when the dynamics is chaotic. It is therefore important to reconstruct not just the topology of the attractor, but its symmetry. We indicate how {{this can be done}} by extending the Packard-Takens approach to a single equivariant observation, taking values not in the real numbers R but in a linear representation V of the symmetry group G. In effect a single set of symmetrically related observations is required. Our central point is that not all plausible choices for such a set can generate embeddings. In order for the method to produce an embedding, it is necessary that V should be "sufficiently complicated". More precisely, the phase space M must be subordinate to V in a sense introduced by Wassermann. This concept is technical, but unavoidable in this context, and it greatly clarifies the issue of embeddability. Using it, we state a symmetric version of the <b>Takens</b> embedding <b>theorem,</b> and sketch the proof. We also discuss the issue of "setwise" versus 'pointwise' symmetry of an attractor, and relate this to the transition from spatial order to spatial disorder in temporally chaotic systems...|$|R

The inference of i) the probability density function of the coefficients of the working hypothesis and ii) the establishing of constraint driven pseudo-inverse condition for the modeling phase of the prediction scheme, is made, for the case of normal distributions, {{with the aid of}} the quantum mechanical virial theorem. The well-known reciprocity relations and the associated Legendre transform structure for the Fisher information measure (FIM, hereafter) -based model in a vector setting (with least square constraints) are self-consistently derived. These relations are demonstrated to yield an intriguing form of the FIM for the modeling phase, which defines the working hypothesis, solely in terms of the observed data.

40|$|Polysomnography (PSG), which {{incorporates}} {{measures of}} sleep with measures of EEG arousal, air flow, respiratory movement and oxygenation, is universally {{regarded as the}} reference standard in diagnosing sleep-related respiratory diseases such as obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Over 15 channels of physiological signals are measured from a subject undergoing a typical overnight PSG session. The signals often suffer from data losses, interferences and artefacts. In a typical sleep scoring session, artefact-corrupted signal segments are visually detected and removed from further consideration. This is a highly time-consuming process, and subjective judgement {{is required for the}} job. During typical sleep scoring sessions, the target is the detection of segments of diagnostic interest, and signal restoration is not utilized for distorted segments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for artefact detection and signal restoration based on the redundancy among respiratory flow signals. We focus on the air flow (thermistor sensors) and nasal pressure signals which are clinically significant in detecting respiratory disturbances. The method treats the respiratory system and other organs that provide respiratory-related inputs/outputs to it (e. g., cardiovascular, brain) as a possibly nonlinear coupled-dynamical system, and uses the celebrated <b>Takens</b> embedding <b>theorem</b> as the theoretical basis for signal prediction. Nonlinear prediction across time (self-prediction) and signals (cross-prediction) provides us with a mechanism to detect artefacts as unexplained deviations. In addition to detection, the proposed method carries the potential to correct certain classes of artefacts and restore the signal. In this study, we categorize commonly occurring artefacts and distortions in air flow and nasal pressure measurements into several groups and explore the efficacy of the proposed technique in detecting/recovering them. The results we obtained from a database of clinical PSG signals indicated that the proposed technique can detect artefacts/distortions with a sensitivity > 88. 3 % and specificity > 92. 4 %.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this first}} paper, we prove a theorem that {{establishes}} a necessary topological {{condition for the}} occurrence of first or second order phase transitions; in order for these to occur, the topology of certain submanifolds of configuration space must necessarily change at the phase transition point. The theorem applies to a wide class of smooth, finite-range and confining potentials V bounded below, describing systems confined in finite regions of space with continuously varying coordinates. The relevant configuration space submanifolds are both the level sets {Σv: = V − 1 N (v) }v∈R of the potential function VN and the configuration space submanifolds enclosed by the Σv defined by {Mv: = V − 1 ((−∞, v]) }v∈R, N N {{is the number of}} degrees of freedom and v is the potential energy. The proof of the theorem proceeds by showing that, under the assumption of diffeomorphicity of the equipotential hypersurfaces {Σv}v∈R, {{as well as of the}} {Mv}v∈R, in an arbitrary interval of values for ¯v = v/N, the Helmoltz free energy is uniformly convergent in N to its thermodynamic limit, at least within the class of twice differentiable functions, in the corresponding interval of temperature. <b>Taken</b> alone this <b>theorem</b> is not very powerful, however it is essential to prove another theorem- in paper II- which makes a stronger statement about the relevance of topology for phase transitions. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with rigorous results {{in the theory of}} turbulence and fluid flow. While derived from the abstract theory of attractors in infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, they shed some light on the conventional heuristic theories of turbulence, and can be used to justify a well-known experimental method. Two results are discussed here in detail, both based on parametrization of the attractor. The first shows that any two fluid flows can be distinguished by a sufficient number of point observations of the velocity. This allows one to connect rigorously the dimension of the attractor with the Landau–Lifschitz ‘number of degrees of freedom’, and hence to obtain estimates on the ‘minimum length scale of the flow’ using bounds on this dimension. While for two-dimensional flows the rigorous estimate agrees with the heuristic approach, there is still a gap between rigorous results in the three-dimensional case and the Kolmogorov theory. Secondly, the problem of using experiments to reconstruct the dynamics of a flow is considered. The standard way of doing this is to take a number of repeated observations, and appeal to the <b>Takens</b> time-delay embedding <b>theorem</b> to guarantee that one can indeed follow the dynamics ‘faithfully’. However, this result relies on restrictive conditions that do not hold for spatially extended systems: an extension is given here that validates this important experimental technique for use in the study of turbulence. Although the abstract results underlying this paper have been presented elsewhere, making them specific to the Navier–Stokes equations provides answers to problems particular to fluid dynamics, and motivates further questions that would not arise from within the abstract theory itself...|$|R

40|$|Sleep disordered {{breathing}} (SDB) is {{a highly}} prevalent but an under-diagnosed disease. Among adults in the ages between 30 to 60 years, 24 % of males and 9 % of females show conditions of SDB, while 82 % of men and 93 % of women with moderate to severe SDB remain undiagnosed. Polysomnography (PSG) is the reference diagnostic test for SDB. During PSG, a number of physiological signals are recorded during an overnight sleep and then manually scored for sleep/wake stages and SDB events to obtain the reference diagnosis. The manual scoring of SDB events is an extremely time consuming and cumbersome task with high inter- and intra-rater variations. PSG is a labour intensive, expensive and patient inconvenient test. Further, PSG facilities are limited leading to long waiting lists. There is an enormous clinical need for automation of PSG scoring and an alternative automated ambulatory method suitable for screening the population. During the work of this thesis, we focus (1) on implementing a framework that enables more reliable scoring of SDB events which also lowers manual scoring time, and (2) implementing a reliable automated screening procedure {{that can be used}} as a patient-friendly home based study. The recordings of physiological measurements obtained during patients’ sleep of- ten suffer from data losses, interferences and artefacts. In a typical sleep scoring session, artifact-corrupted signal segments are visually detected and removed from further consideration. We developed a novel framework for automated artifact detection and signal restoration, based on the redundancy among respiratory flow signals. The signals focused on are the airflow (thermistor sensors) and nasal pressure signals that are clinically significant in detecting respira- tory disturbances. We treat the respiratory system as a dynamical system, and use the celebrated <b>Takens</b> embedding <b>theorem</b> as the theoretical basis for sig- nal prediction. In this study, we categorise commonly occurring artefacts and distortions in the airflow and nasal pressure measurements into several groups and explore the efficacy of the proposed technique in detecting/recovering them. Results we obtained from a database of clinical PSG signals indicated that theproposed technique can detect artefacts/distortions with a sensitivity > 88 % and specificity > 92 %. This work has the potential to simplify the work done by sleep scoring technicians, and also to improve automated sleep scoring methods. During the next phase of the thesis we have investigated the diagnostic ability of single – and dual–channel respiratory flow measuring devices. Recent studies have shown that single channel respiratory flow measurements can be used for automated diagnosis/screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) diseases. Improvements for reliable home-based monitoring for SDB may be achieved with the use of predictors based on recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA essentially measures the complex structures present in a time series and are relatively independent of the nonlinearities present in the respiratory measurements such as those due to breathing nonlinearities and sensor movements. The nasal pressure, thermistor-based airflow, abdominal movement and thoracic movement measurements obtained during Polysomnography, were used in this study to implement an algorithm for automated screening for SDB diseases. The algorithm predicts SDB-affected measurement segments using twelve features based on RQA, body mass index (BMI) and neck circumference using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). The rate of SDB affected segments of data per hour of recording (RDIS) is used as a measure for the diagnosis of SDB diseases. The operating points to be chosen were the prior probability of SDB affected data segments (π 1) and the RDIS threshold value, above which a patient is predicted to have a SDB disease. Cross-validation with five-folds, stratified based on the RDI values of the recordings, was used in estimating the operating points. Sensitivity and specificity rates for the final classifier were estimated using a two-layer assessment approach with the operating points chosen at the inner layer using five-fold cross-validation and the choice assessed at the outer layer using repeated learning-testing. The nasal pressure measurement showed higher accuracy compared to other respiratory measurements when used alone. The nasal pressure and thoracic movement measurements were identified as the best pair of measurements to be used in a dual channel device. The estimated sensitivity and specificity (standard error) in diagnosing SDB disease (RDI ≥ 15) are 90. 3 (3. 1) % and 88. 3 (5. 5) % when nasal pressure is used alone and together with the thoracic movement it was 89. 5 (3. 7) % and 100. 0 (0. 0) %. Present results suggest that RQA of a single respiratory measurement has potential to be used in an automated SDB screening device, while with dual-channel more reliable accuracy can be expected. Improvements may be possible by including other RQA based features and optimisation of the parameters...|$|R
