5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions.

This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements.

The paper tries to explore this relationship. <b>Transaction</b> cost <b>and</b> institutional variables are analysed using a principal component analysis and OLS. The results confirm the original working hypothesis {{of the existence of}} a relationship between <b>transaction</b> costs <b>and</b> culture. The component of cultural characteristics having a pro-growth orientation reduces <b>transaction</b> costs <b>and</b> enhances economic institutions, while the component of cultural characteristics that are reflected in the pro-social characteristics of cultural background increase it.

5|$|Under the Mint Act of 1792, the largest-denomination coin was {{the gold}} eagle, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a half eagle ($5) and quarter eagle ($2.50). Bullion flowed {{out of the}} United States for {{economic}} reasons {{for much of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it convenient for use in international <b>transactions,</b> <b>and,</b> faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed after Congress revised the weight and fineness of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by Christian Gobrecht, {{who was one of the}} Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock <b>transactions</b> <b>and</b> mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor <b>transactions,</b> <b>and</b> after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet <b>transactions,</b> <b>and</b> the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate <b>transactions</b> <b>and</b> to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E
5|$|Officials at {{the local}} level were the pergade, nadabova, nalagamiga, prabhu and gavunda. The pergades were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The pergades dealing with the royal {{household}} were called manepergade (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called Sunka vergades. The nadabovas were accountants and tax collectors at the Nadu level and sometimes functioned as scribes. The nalagamigas were officers who organized and maintained defence at the Nadu level. The prabhu constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries. The gavundas who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and <b>transactions</b> <b>and</b> even raise militia when required.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theory to explain growth in developed and undeveloped countries. Where <b>transaction</b> <b>and</b> information costs are low, people more easily perceive and oppose activities conducive to deadweight losses. The opposite holds where information <b>and</b> <b>transaction</b> costs are high, {{because it will}} be too costly for relatively weak groups to check the rent-seeking proclivities of the dominant interest groups. And, by definition, high <b>transaction</b> <b>and</b> information costs make it hard to displace incumbent leaders who produce poor growth. The levels of information <b>and</b> <b>transaction</b> costs in different countries will determine how much growth we can expect. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{difficulty}} in shareholder registration creates difficulty for equity <b>transaction</b> <b>and</b> transfer. The existing registration procedure complicates equity <b>transaction</b> <b>and</b> transfer, making it inconvenient for investors to trade equities and liquidate their investments, thereby hindering equity circulation. The lack of liquidity of equity {{is associated with}} high risk, which discourages investors from investing, and is detrimental to crowd fundraisers who want to successfully raise funds and obtain high valuations of their businesses (Lee and Wu 2003). If equity <b>transaction</b> <b>and</b> transfer become efficient, then investors can more easily transfer equities and liquidate their investments, the liquidity of equity increases, <b>and</b> market <b>transactions</b> are activated. This will have positive impacts on both investors and crowdfunders.|$|R
