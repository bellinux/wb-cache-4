5000|$|By deduction, therefore, a <b>trade</b> <b>fixture</b> is not {{a fixture}} at all. Its name is misleading, since a fixture, by definition, is real {{property}} that must remain with the real estate when a seller sells it or a tenant leaves her lease. A trade [...] "fixture" [...] is not real property, but personal property of the tenant.|$|E
50|$|The {{landlord}} {{does have}} some protection. Any damage to the real property caused by the tenant’s removal of trade fixtures must be repaired or {{paid for by the}} tenant. If a <b>trade</b> <b>fixture</b> is not removed when the tenant moves out, those trade fixtures become the landlord’s property through the process of accession. For example, if a restaurant goes bankrupt and the owner forgoes his right and the expense of removing all the kitchen equipment, dining booths and other trade fixtures, those trade fixtures become the landlord's property. In this manner, they will no longer be trade fixtures and can actually become regular fixtures, hence real property.|$|E

50|$|Further {{controversy}} {{was generated}} when, in May 1901, many traders within the markets were given one week's notice to vacate their stalls so that {{work on the}} new hall could commence. Traders demanded compensation for loss of <b>trade,</b> <b>fixtures</b> and fittings.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{exception to}} the usual treatment of fixtures is the category of <b>trade</b> <b>fixtures</b> (often called [...] "chattel" [...] fixtures)—chattels installed by a tenant on leased commercial property specifically for their use in a trade or business. These may always be removed by the tenant, so long as any damage to the structure caused by the removal is repaid or repaired. For example, business signage, display counters, store shelves, liquor bars, and machining equipment are often firmly, if not almost permanently, attached to the building or land. However, they remain personal property and can be removed by the tenant, since {{they are part of}} the tenant's business.|$|R
40|$|At {{least since}} the {{decision}} in Poole 2 ̆ 7 s Case, 1 Salk. 368 (1703), it has been considered as settled that a tenant {{has the right to}} remove <b>trade</b> <b>fixtures</b> placed, upon the demised premises for the purpose of furthering his trade. There is a well-marked tendency in some jurisdictions to greatly extend this right of removal so as to include anything added by the tenant to the leased property 2 ̆ 2 in furtherance of the purpose for which the premises were leased. 2 ̆ 2 Hayward v. School District, 139 Mich. 541, 102 N. W. 999; Bircher v. Parker, 40 Mo. 118; Heddrick v. Smith, 103 Ind. 203; Wittenmeyer v. Board of Education, 10. C. C. 119. The right of removal, in the cases where it exists, must of course be exercised within the time settled by the law of the jurisdiction, and the rules in the various states are not entirely harmonious in that regard. For example compare Kerr v. Kingsbury, 39 Irich. 150, with Loughrad v. Ross, 45 N. Y. 792...|$|R

40|$|Guidance Note 1 of the Red Book {{states that}} the {{valuation}} of an operational entity includes four components: the land and buildings; the <b>trade</b> <b>fixtures</b> and fittings; the trading potential, excluding personal goodwill; and the benefit of any transferable licenses and consents. Accounting changes {{in recent years have}} increasingly recognised the importance of intangible assets such as intellectual capital and goodwill. Similarly, recent tax changes demonstrate the government's acceptance of the importance of such items in achieving and maintaining business competitiveness. This paper has two key objectives: first, to analyse the application of the Red Book to trade-related valuations, paying particular attention to the treatment of goodwill and second, to critically evaluate the accounting treatment of goodwill and in particular the application of Financial Reporting Standard 10. In order to understand the workings of the market, the corporate hotel sector was used as a case study. The key findings of the research are that valuers expressed considerable unease with the apportioning of market value between tangible assets and goodwill, there was no consensus on how (or if) goodwill could be measured reliably. Second, that the valuation methods adopted are, to a degree, naïve. While explicit changes are made to the cash-flow projections, there is insufficient appreciation of the changing risk profile that might lead to an adjustment to the earnings multiplier. The accounting difficulties and inconsistencies concerning goodwill arise largely because of inadequate valuation methods. Recent tax changes also point to the need for a robust and defendable valuation methodology. Application of one such theoretically sound approach to valuing goodwill (the bridge model) is illustrated in this paper. While the research focused on the corporate hotel sector, the findings have wider implications for other sectors of the market where operational entities are valued with regard to their trading potential...|$|R
40|$|Reconfigurable {{assembly}} systems {{enable a}} family of products to be assembled in a single system by adjusting and reconfiguring fixtures according to each product. The sharing of fixtures among different products impacts their robustness to fixture variation due to <b>trade</b> offs in <b>fixture</b> design (to allow the accommodation {{of the family in}} the single system) and to frequent reconfigurations. This paper proposes a methodology to achieve robustness of the fixture layout design through an optimal distribution of the locators in a multistation assembly system for a product family. This objective is accomplished by (1) the use of a multistation assembly process model for the product family, and (2) minimizing the combined sensitivity of the products to fixture variation. The optimization considers the feasibility of the locator layout by taking into account the constraints imposed by the different products and the processes (assembly sequence, data scheme, and reconfigurable tools' workspace). A case study where three products are assembled in four stations is presented. The sensitivity of the optimal layout was benchmarked against the ones obtained using dedicated assembly lines for each product. This comparison demonstrates that the proposed approach does not significantly sacrifice robustness while allowing the assembly of all products in a single reconfigurable line...|$|R
50|$|The club's annual {{general meeting}} (AGM) is held each year between 1 January and 30 June. The purpose of the AGM is to affirm minutes of the {{previous}} meeting, receive reports, consider the financial statements for the year ending 31 December previous and to elect office bearers.Each year the AGM is held in a different location throughout Australia. The AGM locations are chosen by the National Committee and ratified by the Extended Natcom meeting, usually three {{years prior to the}} event being held. The AGM event has formal fixtures running for four days of the event, namely the Road Safety Forum on the Thursday, the Extended Natcom meeting held on the Friday, the Friday night Meet and Greet social and meal, the Grand Parade and Opening Ceremony on the Saturday morning and the AGM itself on the Saturday afternoon. These are followed by the Saturday night dinner and the Sunday morning church service, and finally the closing ceremony after the church service.Additional to these <b>fixtures,</b> <b>trade</b> displays, bike test rides, organised rides, and social gatherings have been included in past events by the host committee, starting as early as the Monday preceding the actual meeting weekend, for the benefit and entertainment of visiting members.|$|R
