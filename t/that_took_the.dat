Popovac was {{a proponent of}} Bosnian Muslim cooperation with the Chetniks and suggested that they recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the communist Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lives {{of as many as}} 2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943, he led an attack against a Muslim village. Later that year, he was killed in disputed circumstances near the town of Trebinje.|$|E

French driver Romain Grosjean had already worn an armband with the flag of his country during Saturday's sessions.

5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The proscenium stage was simple and had only one main prop, a staircase in the middle. The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine forces, under Licario's command, now (in 1272/1273) {{launched}} a campaign <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> fortresses of Larmena, La Cuppa, Clisura and Manducho. The Lombard triarchs then appealed to their liege-lord, Prince William II of Achaea, and to Dreux de Beaumont, marshal of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily. William was able to recover La Cuppa, but de Beaumont was defeated in a pitched battle and was subsequently recalled by Charles of Anjou. Between then and 1275, according to the Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo, Licario himself served in the Byzantine army in Asia Minor, where he scored a victory against the Turks.|$|E

During her training at Quantico, Alex learns that Liam and Ryan were indirectly responsible for an incident of gang violence <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> life of Drew's girlfriend and led him to join the FBI, a source of tension between Liam and Drew.

5|$|Following Air Force's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return by the Hokies, Virginia Tech's offense began a {{drive at}} its 28-yard line. A five-yard false-start penalty pushed the Tech offense back five yards, but a long run by quarterback Mark Cox made up the penalty and earned Tech a first down. Another first down followed, and Tech {{penetrated}} into the Air Force side of the field. Once there, Eddie Hunter evaded Falcon defenders for a 33-yard run <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> Hokies inside Air Force's 20-yard line. Three more plays pushed Tech forward, inside Air Force's five-yard line, for a first down. On the next play, Maurice Williams ran forward, into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 73 lead with 1:42 left in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State {{returned}} {{the ball to}} the 27-yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short run to the right. On the next play, NC State picked up the game's first first down with a rush up the middle by fullback Mal Crite. Crite picked up another first down on the next play, driving the Wolfpack inside Virginia Tech territory, but the Hokies' defense stiffened and forced the Wolfpack to punt after NC State failed to gain another first down. Tech {{returned the}} punt to its 21-yard line, where the Tech offense took over. On Virginia Tech's first offensive play, running back Maurice Williams broke free for a 77-yard run <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> Hokies inside the one-yard line of NC State. The run was the longest of Williams' career and is a Peach Bowl record for longest play from scrimmage. Two plays later, Virginia Tech's Eddie Hunter crossed the goal line and scored the game's first points. The touchdown and extra point made the score 70, Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E

5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E

5|$|Sections {{of what is}} now NY23 {{were part}} of {{unsigned}} legislative routes as early as 1908; however, NY23 itself was not assigned until 1924. At the time, the route extended from Oneonta to Massachusetts and followed a slightly different alignment from Cairo to Claverack via Hudson <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> route along modern County Route23B (CR23B) in eastern Greene County. NY23 was extended west to Norwich in the mid-1920s and to NY26 in northwestern Chenango County in 1930. The route was gradually moved onto its current alignment between Cairo and Claverack in the 1950s and 1960s, and realigned on its western end in 1984 to serve Cortland County.|$|E
