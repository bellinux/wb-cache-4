5|$|In April 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that six athletes had <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, {{one of them}} a medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Davide Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Stefan Schumacher, were confirmed as having <b>tested</b> <b>positive.</b> Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the 2008 Tour de France, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.|$|E

Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
