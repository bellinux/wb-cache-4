25|$|When {{teeth are}} knocked-out, {{they end up}} on an {{artificial}} surface: the floor, the ground or material such as carpeting. If the surface is hard, the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells will be traumatized. Since the cells remaining on the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> are very delicate, additional trauma to the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells must be avoided {{so as to avoid}} more <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cell crushing. This damage can occur while picking the tooth up and/or during transportation to the dentist.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{critical}} factor for reduction of the death of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells and the subsequent root replacement resorption following reimplantation of knocked-out teeth is maintenance of normal cell physiology and metabolism of the cells left on the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> while the tooth is out of the socket. In order to maintain this normalcy, the environment in which the teeth are stored must supply the optimum internal cell pressure, cell nutrients and pH.|$|E
25|$|Saliva, that is {{placing the}} tooth under the {{accident}} victim’s tongue {{or in the}} cheek, has been recommended. Saliva, as a storage media, causes twice damage as water. Its osmolality is very low, causing bursting of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells, but additionally, because saliva is filled with its normal flora of microorganisms, it will severely infect the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells. When the tooth is replanted, not only will the cells be necrotic but they will also infect the bone socket.|$|E

5000|$|Maxillary sinuses: Within the maxilla, {{above the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>roots.</b> Each {{is divided into}} two components, the Rostral maxillary sinus in front and the Caudal maxillary sinus behind. They do not communicate. In addition, each of these is {{subdivided}} into a medial (inside) and lateral (outside) component, by an incomplete bone wall that carries the infraorbital canal containing nerves and blood vessels. The close proximity to the <b>tooth</b> <b>roots</b> mean that as the teeth erupt with age, the maxillary sinuses become larger.|$|R
25|$|It was {{discovered}} 30 {{years ago that}} milk was less damaging to knocked out teeth than water or saliva. It was recommended {{because it has a}} compatible osmolality (fluid pressure) to <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells and it is thought to be readily available. However, like physiologic saline, milk lacks the necessary metabolites and glucose necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells. The cells on knocked-out tooth roots in milk do not die immediately but are unable to replicate (mitosis) and so are less able to reform new cells when replanted.|$|E
25|$|When a tooth {{is picked}} up, it {{should always be}} grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger {{pressure}} on the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even {{with the use of}} a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root.</b> At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment.|$|E

50|$|This genus is {{represented}} only by isolated teeth found in continental Europe. Its postcanine molariform teeth are tricuspate or tetracuspate and the <b>tooth</b> <b>roots</b> are incipiently divided.|$|R

50|$|A typical radula {{comprises}} {{a number}} of bilaterally-symmetrical self-similar rows of <b>teeth</b> <b>rooted</b> in a radular membrane. Some species have teeth that bend with the membrane as it moves over the odontophore, whereas in other species, the <b>teeth</b> are firmly <b>rooted</b> in place, and the entire radular structure moves as one entity.|$|R
25|$|Normally {{metabolizing}} <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> {{cells have}} an internal cell pressure (osmolality) of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When {{there is an}} uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body {{at a later time}} is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called “replacement root resorption”. During this process, the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the immunologic mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the <b>tooth</b> <b>root.</b> This is called “root resorption” It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed ankylosis) attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth.|$|E
25|$|Every tooth is {{connected}} to its surrounding bone by the periodontal ligament. The tooth receives its nourishment through this ligament. When a tooth is knocked-out, this ligament is stretched and splits in half; half stays on the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> and half stays on the socket wall. If these two halves can be kept alive, the tooth can be replanted and the halves of the ligament will reattach and the tooth will remain vital. The half that stays on the socket wall, since it remains connected to the bone blood supply, is naturally kept alive. However, the ligament cells that remain on the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> lose their blood and nutrition supply and must be artificially maintained. They must be protected from two potentially destructive processes: cell crushing and loss of normal cell metabolism. All treatment between {{the time of the}} accident and the ultimate replantation must be focused on preventing these two possibilities.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} storage media {{available}} for knocked-out tooth storage. The most often recommended are: saliva, physiologic saline, milk and pH balanced cell preserving fluids. Water and ice {{have been shown}} to damage the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells, and as such, avulsed teeth should never be stored in them. The osmolality and pH of water and ice is very low (7-17mOs) compared to normal cell pressure (280 mOs). When a knocked-out tooth is placed in water, the cells attempt to equalize with the surrounding environment, the cell fluid tries to move to the outside pressure environment and burst. Water with table salt in it is damaging to the knocked out teeth.|$|E
5000|$|He {{said that}} braces {{should be used}} to correct the {{position}} of teeth, and that children's teeth could be moved more easily and quickly than adults', a result {{of the size of the}} <b>teeth</b> <b>roots,</b> according to Fauchard.|$|R
50|$|Another common {{complication}} of root canal therapy {{is when the}} entire length of the root canal is not completely cleaned out and filled (obturated) with root canal filling material (usually gutta percha). The X-ray in the right margin below shows two adjacent teeth that had received bad root canal therapy. The root canal filling material (3, 4 & 10) does not extend to the end of the <b>tooth</b> <b>roots</b> (5, 6 & 11). The dark circles at the bottom of the <b>tooth</b> <b>roots</b> (7 & 8) indicated infection in the surrounding bone. Recommended treatment is either to redo the root canal therapy if possible or extract the tooth and place dental implant(s).|$|R
50|$|Tooth gemination, in {{contrast}} to fusion, arises when two teeth develop from one tooth bud. When the anomalous tooth appears to be two separate teeth, {{it appears that the}} patient has an extra tooth, although they have a normal number of <b>tooth</b> <b>roots.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first {{reported}} cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare’ in 1593. In 1706, Pierre Fauchard also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth {{should be considered a}} temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966 in a retrospective study, Andresen theorized that 90% of avulsed teeth could be successfully retained if they were replanted within the first 30 minutes of the accident. In 1974, Cvek showed that removal of the dental pulp following reimplantation was necessary to prevent resorption of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root.</b> In 1974, Cvek showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al. showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank’s Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen showed that crushing of cells on the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in prognosis. In 1983, Matsson et al. showed that soaking in Hank’s Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog’s teeth that were dry for 60 minutes. In 1989, a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al. showed that extracted dog’s teeth could be stored in Hank’s Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours.|$|E
25|$|The most optimum {{storage media}} that are {{available}} {{have been shown to}} be pH balanced cell preserving solutions. The best known and most extensively tested is called Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). It has all of the metabolites such as Ca, phosphate ions, K+ and glucose that are necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism for long periods of time. HBSS has been extensively tested in dental and medical research for the past twenty years. This research has shown that 90% of cells stored in HBSS for 24 hours maintain their normal viability and after four days, still have 70%viable. In research studies, extracted dog’s teeth that have been placed in HBSS for four days can still be replanted with little signs of resorption. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution is found in a , a storage device for the storage, preservation, and regeneration of <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> cells.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes the {{symptoms}} {{reported in the}} history are misleading and point the examiner to the wrong area of the mouth. For instance, sometimes people may mistake pain from pulpitis in a lower tooth as pain in the upper teeth, and vice versa. In other instances, the apparent examination findings may be misleading and lead to the wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment. Pus from a pericoronal abscess associated with a lower third molar may drain along the submucosal plane and discharge as a parulis over {{the roots of the}} teeth towards the front of the mouth (a [...] "migratory abscess"). Another example is decay of the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> which is hidden from view below the gumline, giving the casual appearance of a sound tooth if careful periodontal examination is not carried out.|$|E

500|$|A typical implant {{consists}} of a titanium screw (resembling a <b>tooth</b> <b>root)</b> with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made out of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained. Cold work hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N [...]05 percent, C [...]10 percent, H [...]015 percent, Fe [...]50 percent, and O [...]40 percent) is {{the most commonly used}} titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V, (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments. Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, anodic oxidation or various-media blasting) to increase the surface area and osseointegration potential of the implant.|$|E
500|$|In pulpitis, an {{important}} distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp {{to return to a}} state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. [...] Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of regenerative endodontics is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the <b>tooth</b> <b>root</b> has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates.|$|E

30|$|In {{situations}} {{where there is}} an inadequate interdental space, reduced interocclusal space, convergent adjacent <b>tooth</b> <b>roots</b> or close proximity of adjacent <b>tooth</b> <b>roots</b> or narrow atrophic osseous contour, mini implants may be appropriate. Nevertheless, when using new available narrow-diameter implants to replace a single molar, two implants could be used even when {{the distance between the}} adjacent teeth is smaller [7]. Mini dental implants are minimally invasive since it allows conservative placement of implants in bone without bone grafting and significant trauma and expense for patient and they can be used in patients who would normally be considered high risk (e.g., patients on anticoagulant or steroid therapy). In addition the general dentist can master this technique with minimal training and surgical experience, significantly expanding his armamentarium [6].|$|R
