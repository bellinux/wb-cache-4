The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things}} that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

500|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the Virgin Mary in sorrow, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. [...] Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for mass, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did. A common theme was that Edgardo had become a kind of prodigy—according to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic L'armonia della religione colla civiltà, he had learned the catechism perfectly within a few days, [...] "blesse the servant who baptised him," [...] and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the Jesuit periodical La Civiltà Cattolica in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. This story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative—that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: [...] "I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope." ...|$|E
40|$|Children acquire {{their native}} {{language}} according to a well-defined time frame. Surprisingly, although children raised in bilingual environments have <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> roughly twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> about language <b>as</b> their monolingual peers, the speed of acquisition is comparable in monolinguals and bilinguals. Here, we show that preverbal 12 -month-old bilingual infants have become more flexible at learning speech structures than monolinguals. When given the opportunity <b>to</b> simultaneously <b>learn</b> two different regularities, bilingual infants learned both, whereas monolinguals learned only one of them. Hence, bilinguals may acquire two languages in the time in which monolinguals acquire one because they quickly become more flexible learners. Although the remarkable performance ofchildren acquiring one language is im-pressive, many children acquire more than one language simultaneously. As bilingual children presumably have <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> roughly twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> their monolingual peers (because they learn two languages instead of one), one would expect their language acquisition to be somewhat delayed.

Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day.

She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts.

2500|$|As he {{appeared}} to be an ardent Nazi, Sorge was welcome at the German Embassy. One Japanese journalist who knew Sorge described him [...] in 1935 as [...] "a typical, swashbuckling, arrogant Nazi...quick-tempered, hard-drinking". As the Japan correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung, Sorge developed a network of sources about Japanese politics, and soon German diplomats, including the ambassador Herbert von Dirksen came to depend upon Sorge as a source of intelligence about the fractious and secretive world of Japanese politics. The Japanese values of honne and tatame (the former literally means [...] "true sound", roughly [...] "as things are" [...] while the latter literally means [...] "façade" [...] or roughly [...] "as things appear"), namely the tendency of Japanese people to hide their real feelings and profess to believe in things that they do not, made deciphering Japan's politics especially difficult. That Sorge was fluent in Japanese further enhanced his status as a Japanologist. Sorge was very interested in Asian history and culture, especially those of China and Japan, and when sober tried <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he could. During this time, Sorge befriended General Eugen Ott, the German military attache to Japan while seducing his wife Helma. As military attache, Ott sent reports back to Berlin containing his assessments of the Imperial Japanese Army, which Frau Ott copied and passed on to Sorge, who in his turn passed them on to Moscow (through it should be noted Frau Ott believed Sorge was merely working for the Nazi Party). As the Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, German influence on the Japanese Army was strong, and Ott had good contacts with Japanese officers.|$|E
40|$|Although ADHD is {{most often}} {{thought of as a}} {{disorder}} that affects children, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the disorder also strongly affects the lives of adults, impairing their ability to func-tion across many domains. Adults with ADHD often encounter difficulty at work, within personal and social rela-tionships, and in many seemingly sim-ple, and often taken for granted, everyday tasks. One such task is that of driving an automobile. While most adults manage to drive safely and care-fully without having to devote a great deal of cognitive effort, the same is not necessarily true for adults with ADHD. The cognitive deficits present in those with the disorder set the stage for poten-tially seriously impaired driving perfor-mance, and for this reason it is imperative that researchers, clinicians, and individuals with the disorder (and those close <b>to</b> them) <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible about the dangers and ways in which they can be prevented.

In multicultural and multilingual societies, the implicit pedagogical assumptions of e-learning environments need to be made explicit. Two different cultural dimensions of educational practices are more specifically concerned: the pedagogical culture and the values, beliefs, attitudes, theories and models involved; and the digital culture and the emerging transformations related to knowledge and pedagogical modelling. The development of intercultural abilities, already present in language education, can lead the way to an enhanced experience of learning and teaching.
