5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity <b>they</b> <b>deliver</b> to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. <b>They</b> <b>deliver</b> painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth stingers, and can thus sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E

25|$|Some {{doctors say}} an {{advantage}} to stereotactic treatments is that <b>they</b> <b>deliver</b> {{the right amount of}} radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.|$|E

25|$|Photojournalism is a {{particular}} form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, {{but in some cases}} the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. <b>They</b> <b>deliver</b> news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.|$|E

Horn {{personally}} witnessed the bravery of the famous Rough Riders and colored regiments the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry during their assault on San Juan Hill, {{as well as the}} humiliating rout of American soldiers under Brig. Gen. Hamilton Hawkins. Although the packers were non-combatants, they were still prone to being attacked by Cuban rebels. Horn considered himself lucky to have lost no tracker during the war, although Horn recalled that he and his men were under constant fire as <b>they</b> <b>deliver</b> the rations and ammunition to the soldiers. Horn continued working as a packer during the war even though he and many of his men contracted yellow fever. At one point he was bedridden and was deemed unfit for combat.
