In France, as in many other Western countries, the arrival of the population attracted by new housing developments is seen as a vector for social diversity.

This paper explores how newcomers in new private housing developments experience their new neighbourhood based on qualitative interviews at three study sites in France. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> <b>underlines</b> how social interaction is influenced both by residential trajectories, leading to more or less familiarity and social distance with the neighbourhood, and spatial configurations, leading to various opportunities for social contact in public spaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{architectural}} envelope is nowadays one of {{the most}} important sector in building industry, in terms of technological innovation and design experimentation. The performance of the envelope is essential to reduce the environmental impact of the building, like energy consumption and greenhouse emissions. At the same moment, wood seems to be {{one of the}} most considered material for constructions, both for structures and envelopes, even in geographic areas where it was historically not used. Good mechanical properties, good thermal and acoustic insulation, easiness to be worked, a positive and eco-friendly message, all these aspects make wood a very appreciated material in contemporary architecture. University Iuav of Venice, after a deep analysis of all these aspects, decided to develop a specific research project in collaboration with Simco Tecnocovering (nowadays Simeon S. r. l.), an Italian company specialized in architectural envelope: to design and produce a prototype of an innovative curtain walls entirely made with wooden load-bearing structure and glass infill panels; a façade system that, as a market survey showed, was almost absent.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the impact that}} high demand had on the production and thus the quality of works of art. Considering Botticelli as a case study, and employing economic theory on reputation and demand, it argues that master painters made choices about the levels of excellence they produced. Drawing on the documentary and technical evidence concerning four of Botticelli's important altarpieces, the article demonstrates, through attention to the painter's approaches to design, preparation and painting technique, how Botticelli managed and controlled quality {{on a case-by-case basis}} in the workshop. It also argues that Botticelli maintained two individual strands of production, and that these amounted to methods of conceptualizing works of art. Referring to anthropological theory and drawing on the influential work of Hans Körner on Botticelli's workshop and the way works in series were produced, <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>underlines</b> the relationship between derivative works of art and issues of excellence and demand...|$|E

The next step was classifying them into three main categories, namely legends of fairies, legends of catastrophes and legends of magic and ghosts. Finally, the analyses of the tales consisted of identifying relevant folklore motifs, trying to fit them into a historical context within the Celtic world.
