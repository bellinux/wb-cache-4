On this ground, feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism.

25|$|Eventually a chain {{will come}} to an end, usually with a new entrant into the system or when the last unit in a chain is abandoned, merged, or destroyed. This can involve a new {{employee}} recruit or a housing unit on market for the first time, or when {{a house in the}} chain is torn down, left empty, or the duties of a vacant job are distributed among other employees. A vacancy chain is simply the sequence of moves that a vacancy makes from initial entry into a system to final termination. The distribution of material resources and social positions through vacancy chain processes requires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> distributed possess a number of abstract qualities. These qualities include that the resource units in question are reusable, discrete, identifiable, and utilized by one individual or social group at a time.|$|E

In it Nick {{knows he has}} left his needs behind; Debra Moddelmog highlights how all of the Nick storylines, {{and most of the}} others in the collection, are about a [...] "flight from pain". She believes that Gertrude Stein's definition of the Lost Generation applies to In Our Time as much, if not more so, as to The Sun Also Rises; that [...] "Nick seems to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> most worth having and caring about– life, love, ideals, companions, peace, freedom– will be lost sooner or later, and he is not sure how to cope with this assurance, except through irony, bitterness, and, sometimes, wishful thinking."

500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E
500|$|Neutopia {{received}} much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew similar similarities to Zelda. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that Neutopia was released {{two years before}} [...] and said that Neutopia [...] "kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that [...] "the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield", but he noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that keep the game from being better than Zelda were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for {{those who do not}} own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several [...] "head-scratching moments" [...] which include references to Judaism and Islam as well as quotes from Star Wars. Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to Zelda, including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from Zelda are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying Zelda, might be better as it added additional features that set it apart. Destructoid's Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of Zelda to China Warriors copying of Kung-Fu Master, and he pointed out what are also considered Zelda clones such as Crusader of Centy and Alundra for the Sega Genesis and PlayStation, respectively.|$|E
60|$|Since {{all known}} {{things are in}} time, a causal law must take account of {{temporal}} relations.

2500|$|Process {{philosophy}} {{embraces the}} Einsteinian world-view, {{and its main}} proponents include Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.

Process philosophy is Heraclitan {{in the sense that}} a fundamental ontological category is change.

Anne-Marie Barry and Chris Yuill, the authors of the book Understanding the Sociology of Health, commented that in episodes in which Grampa appears, the comedy content is often generated by Grampa falling asleep at [...] "inopportune" [...] moments or [...] "embarking" [...] on long rambling stories about his youth. [...] "Instances such as these match popular stereotypes that all old people are 'demented' and in poor health," [...] they wrote.|$|E
2500|$|American Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor {{illustrated}} the sacramental {{understanding of the}} world in her work [...] "Novelist and Believer":St. Augustine wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of the world pour forth from God in a double way: intellectually into the minds of the angels and physically into the world of things.

2500|$|Moore-Bick {{is seen as}} aloof {{and lacking}} empathy; he {{concerned}} residents by suggesting only the technical causes of the fire would be investigated. Dent Coad said she still had less than “total confidence” in Moore-Bick, but “we {{have to work with}} the system we have, unfortunately.” Sources close to the inquiry suggest Moore-Bick is thinking of proposing an advisory panel. He is also inclined to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first stage investigating the immediate causes of the fire, the second investigating broader issues over a longer period. Dent Coad said there must be a legal commitment to a second stage. [...] "We need to look at all the broader issues. One of the concerns about a two part inquiry – like with Hillsborough – is if it’s held off for too long and then it doesn’t happen at all, so that's a concern." [...] Dent Coad wants the first stage to, “look at accountability and recommendations straight away so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that have become most obvious throughout the inquiry are put into action straight away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have {{internal locus of control}} believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. Externals attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E
2500|$|Povestirile vieții, Lungu's {{scientific}} study of 2003, also marks his preoccupation with oral history as a path to investigating Romania's communist past, in particular the 1965-1989 regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. Paul Cernat commends the work for breaking with the pattern of similar post-1989 recoveries, which mainly focus on interviews with political personalities. In contrast, Lungu's book centers on three study cases from working class environments—Florentina Ichim, Vasile Ariton and Petre Jurescu—whom the regime took pride in claiming were its support base. Their retrospective images of the era vary significantly, fluctuating between nostalgia and virulent anti-communism. However, all three witnesses recall having themselves resorted to alternative and illicit mechanisms of survival or self-promotion, in particular theft and political corruption. In his commentary on the interviews, Lungu concluded that, in some cases, the image of workers' lifestyles as offered by the propaganda apparatus was real, [...] "contrary to our expectations". He added, to Cernat's agreement: [...] "Overturning that which was officially stated during the epoch is not indicative of the real state of things and only drags us down into another ideology [...] That {{is why we have}} said: back to the facts!" [...] In his review of the book, literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu resonated with such observations, noting their revelatory aspect: [...] "once confronted with the accounts , I convinced myself once and for all <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which, under Ceaușism, I could still believe united us into a solidarity of suffering, are as false as can be. That is, even though we waited in grueling queues, in the same cold, for the same food rations, an ocean existed between the proletariat [...] and the intellectuals, between 'base and superstructure'. We were simply put two worlds, not just figuratively, but also effectively. There was nothing for us to sell and steal, whereas they had access to the circuits of theft, to the web of programmed lawlessness." ...|$|E
