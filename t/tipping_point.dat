According to O'Neill, the <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> was the refusal of Chase to permit the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E

5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D.

Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> from which he would not recover.|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} can trigger irreversible regime {{shifts in the}} climate system, known as <b>tipping</b> <b>points.</b> Multiple <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> affect each other's probability of occurrence, potentially causing a 'domino effect'. We analyse climate policy {{in the presence of}} a potential domino effect. We incorporate three different <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> occurring at unknown thresholds into an integrated climate-economy model. The optimal emission policy considers all possible thresholds and the resulting interactions between <b>tipping</b> <b>points,</b> economic activity, and policy responses into the indefinite future. We quantify the cost of delaying optimal emission controls in the presence of uncertain <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> and also the benefit of detecting when individual <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> have been triggered. We show that the presence of these <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> nearly doubles today's optimal carbon tax and reduces peak warming along the optimal path by approximately 1 degrees C. The presence of these <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> increases the cost of delaying optimal policy until mid-century by nearly 150 %...|$|R
5000|$|Intensive {{research}} {{over the}} last 20 years has shown that <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid - a matter of decades.

But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined [...] "planetary boundaries" [...] beyond which <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> exist but their precise locations remain elusive.|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{models are}} {{commonly}} used to understand and predict the development of ecological systems, for instance to study the occurrence of <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> and their possible ecological effects. Sensitivity analysis is a key tool {{in the study of}} model responses to changes in conditions. The applicability of available methodologies for sensitivity analysis can be problematic if <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> are involved. In this paper we demonstrate that not considering these <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> may result in misleading statistics on model behaviour. In turn, this limits the applicability of simulation models in ecological research. <b>Tipping</b> <b>points</b> are best revealed when asymptotic model behaviour is considered, i. e. by applying bifurcation analysis. Bifurcation analysis, however, is limited to deterministic dynamic models, whereas many ecological simulation models are nondeterministic and can only be analysed using sensitivity analysis methodologies. In this paper we explore the possibilities for applying methodologies of sensitivity analysis to analyse models with <b>tipping</b> <b>points.</b> The Bazykin-Berezovskaya model, a deterministic ecological model of which the structure regarding <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> is known a priori, is used as case study. We conclude that important clues about the occurrence of tippings points can be revealed from different sensitivity analysis methodologies, if proper statistical and graphical measures are used. The results raise awareness about how <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> affect temporal model responses in ecological simulation models, and may also be more generally applicable for nondeterministic models that cannot be analysed using bifurcation analysis. </p...|$|R
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the <b>tipping</b> <b>point,</b> or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
5|$|The Ojo de Agua Raid was {{the last}} {{important}} military engagement between Mexican Seditionistas and the United States Army. It took place at Ojo de Agua, Texas. As part of the Plan of San Diego, the rebels launched a raid across the Rio Grande into Texas on October 21, 1915 aimed at harassing the American outposts along the Mexican border and disrupting the local economy. After moving across the border, the Seditionistas began an assault against the United States Army Signal Corps station at Ojo de Agua. The small group of American defenders was cornered into a single building and suffered heavy casualties before reinforcements arrived driving the Seditionist force back into Mexico. The raid {{proved to be the}} <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> in the American conflict with the Seditionistas, as its severity convinced American officials to send large numbers of American troops to the area in order to deter any further serious border raids by the Mexican force.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial <b>tipping</b> <b>point,</b> the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E

40|$|Many {{ecological}} systems exhibit <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> {{such that they}} suddenly shift from one state to another. These shifts can be devastating from an ecological point of view, and additionally have {{severe implications for the}} socio-economic system. They can be caused by overcritical perturbations of the state variables such as external shocks, disease emergence, or species removal. It is therefore important to be able to quantify the <b>tipping</b> <b>points.</b> Here we present a study of the <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> by considering the basins of attraction of the stable equilibrium points. We address the question of finding the <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> that lie on the separatrix surface, which partitions the space of system trajectories. We present an algorithm that reconstructs the separatrix by using a Moving Least Squares approximant based on radial basis functions. The algorithm is applied to an eco-epidemiological model of pack hunting predators that suffer disease infection. Our analysis reveals that strong hunting cooperation considerably promotes the survival of predators and renders the predators resilient to perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that several {{elements of the}} climate system could be tipped into a different state by global warming, causing irreversible economic damages. To address their policy implications, we incorporated five interacting climate <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> into a stochastic-dynamic integrated assessment model, calibrating their likelihoods and interactions on results from an existing expert elicitation. Here we show that combining realistic assumptions about policymaker’s preferences under uncertainty, {{with the prospect of}} multiple future interacting climate <b>tipping</b> <b>points,</b> increases the present social cost of carbon (SCC) in the model nearly 8 -fold from 15 /tCO 2 to 116 /tCO 2. Furthermore, passing some <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> increases the likelihood of other <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> occurring {{to such an extent that}} it abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. The corresponding optimal policy involves an immediate, massive effort to control CO 2 emissions, which are stopped by mid-century, leading to climate stabilization at < 1. 5 °C warming above pre-industrial levels...|$|R
