Eighteen female (N = 18; mean age Â± SD: 37. 57 Â± 13. 04) Dutch horse-rider combinations were recruited {{to participate in the}} study. Horse-rider coordination was recorded using two tri-axial wireless accelerometers during a standard ridden protocol. Multiple measures of horse-rider coordination were calculated to investigate the relationship between the horse and rider, while the unpredictability of the acceleration-time series of the horse and rider during task performance were determined separately by means of approximate entropy analysis. The kinematic variables of horse-rider correlation, mean relative phase, mean standard deviation of the relative phase, approximate entropy rider, approximate entropy horse and spectral edge frequency at 95 % of the power in the 0 - 10 Hz frequency band were examined using multiple correlational analyses and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Findings showed significantly different coordination dynamics between equine gaits, with the gait of canter allowing for the highest levels of horse-rider synchronicity. It may be concluded that accelerometers are a valuable tool to map distinct coordination patterns of horse-rider combinations...|$|E
40|$|Horse riding {{changes its}} meaning over time. Formerly horses were {{considered}} just for transports {{of humans and}} things. In last centuries they became hobbies and team mates for equestrian activities. Horse riding today includes several disciplines, {{and many of these}} are olimpic sports. As such, equestrian deserve the attention of sports researchers, who are interested in cardiometabolic adaptations during training and competition. Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Test The cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) today is the most reliable test that provides data on cardio metabolic and ventilatory function during exercise. Data derive from the analisys of : VO 2 : oxygen uptake (ml/min); VCO 2 : carbon dioxyde production (ml/min); VE: pulmonary ventilation (L/min); HR: heart rate (bpm); It became fundamental to obtain and understanding of physiological capacities underlying sports performance. It would be useful to know the energy demands and whether the anaerobic metabolism is recruited. CO 2 excess To obtain an index of anaerobic glicolysis, excess of carbon dioxyde production (CO 2 excess) was assessed as follow: CO 2 excess = VCO 2 - (RER rest ?

40|$|Reason for {{performing}} study: During trot, the rider call either {{rise from the}} saddle during every stride or remain seated. Rising trot is used frequently because it is widely assumed that it decreases the loading of the equine back. This has, however, not been demonstrated in an objective study. Objective: To {{determine the effects of}} rising and <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> on the movements of the horse. Hypothesis: Sitting trot has more extending effect on the horse's back than rising trot and also results in a higher head and neck position. Methods: Twelve horses and one rider were used. Kinematic data were captured at trot during over ground locomotion under 3 conditions: unloaded, rising <b>trot</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> Back movements were calculated using a previously described method with a correction for trunk position. Head-neck position was expressed as extension and flexion of 0, C 3 and C 6, and vertical displacement of C 1 and the bit. Results: Sitting trot had an overall extending effect on the back of horses when compared to the unloaded situation. In rising trot: the maximal flexion of the back was similar to the unloaded situation, while the maximal extension was similar to sitting trot; lateral bending of the back was larger than during the unloaded situation and sitting trot; and the horses held their heads lower than in the other conditions. The angle of C 6 was more flexed in rising than in <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> Conclusions and clinical relevance: The back movement during rising trot showed characteristics of both <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> and the unloaded condition. As the same maximal extension of the back is reached during rising and <b>sitting</b> <b>trot,</b> {{there is no reason to}} believe that rising trot was less challenging for the back...|$|R

40|$|In equestrian sports, it is {{generally}} assumed that rising and <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> load the horse's back differently. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the load on the horse's back in these riding techniques. Kinematic data of 13 riders were collected in rising and <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> The time-history of the position of the rider's centre of mass (CoM) was calculated, and differentiated twice to obtain the acceleration of the CoM. The reaction force between the rider and the horse's back was calculated from the acceleration. Forces were divided by the body weight of the rider to obtain dimensionless forces. As expected, the computed average vertical force did not differ between riding techniques and was not significantly different from the body weight of the riders. At trot, two force peaks were present during one stride cycle. Both peaks in rising trot were significantly lower compared to <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> (peak 1 : 2. 54 ± 0. 30 versus 2. 92 ± 0. 29; p< 0. 001; peak 2 : 1. 95 ± 0. 34 versus 3. 03 ± 0. 32; p< 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives To observe {{postural}} {{characteristics of}} female dressage riders, through application of three-dimensional motion analysis {{and to assess}} the effects of athletic taping on postural asymmetry during <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> Design Randomised cross-over. Setting Data collection took place at Myerscough Agricultural College in an indoor riding area. Participants Ten healthy female experienced dressage riders participated. Main outcome measurements Movement kinematics of the trunk and pelvis, pre and post taping intervention. Results Riders presented pre-intervention with asymmetric movement characteristics through dynamic observation of trunk and pelvic postures during <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> A significant increase (p=< 0. 05) in the range (°) of trunk lateral-flexion following tape intervention applied over the thoracic spine. Conclusion This study supports the quantification of dynamic postural characteristics of dressage athletes by three-dimensional motion analysis. Asymmetrical postures occur within dressage riders when performing <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> The application of tape to ‘align’ asymmetry altered riders’ postures. Taping over the thoracic region resulted in a compensatory increase in motion through the lumbar region. Clinicians should approach the application of postural taping with {{an awareness of the}} restrictive mechanisms of tape. Findings may help clinicians determine whether technique/type of tape applied is suitable for achieving marginal gains in the alignment of posture in competitive dressage athletes...|$|R

To better {{understand}} the loading of the horse by a rider, a sensor was developed to measure the force exerted by the rider on the stirrups. In the study, five horses and 23 riders participated. Stirrup forces measured in <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> and rising trot were synchronised with rider movements measured from digital films and made dimensionless by dividing them by the bodyweight (BW) of the rider. A Fourier transform of the stirrup force data showed that the signals of both <b>sitting</b> and rising <b>trot</b> contained 2. 4 and 4. 8 Hz frequencies. In addition, 1. 1 and 3. 7 Hz frequencies were also present at rising trot. Each stride cycle of trot showed two peaks in stirrup force. The heights of these peaks were 1. 17 ± 0. 28 and 0. 33 ± 0. 14 in rising and 0. 45 ± 0. 24 and 0. 38 ± 0. 22 (stirrup force (N) /BW of rider (N)) in <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> A significant difference was found between the higher peaks of <b>sitting</b> and rising <b>trot</b> (P < 0. 001) and between the peaks within a single stride for both riding styles (P < 0. 001). The higher peak in rising trot occurred during the standing phase of the stride cycle. Riders imposed more force on the stirrups during rising than <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> A combination of stirrup and saddle force data can provide additional information on the total loading of the horse by a rider...|$|R

40|$|The forces {{exerted by}} a rider {{on a horse}} have a direct {{influence}} on the mechanical load experienced by the horse and consequently on its motion pattern. The aim of this thesis is to explore the biomechanical interaction between rider, saddle and horse {{in order to get}} insight in the loading of the horse and to identify potential opportunities to reduce load-related injuries. The influence of man on the horse is mediated trough tack, which functions as an interface between the horse and the human being(s) using it. The tack is often connected to both horse and rider and is therefore well-positioned to incorporate measuring devices that can record the forces between horse and rider. So-called saddle-pressure measuring devices have been used to evaluate saddle-fit and could also be a useful tool to study the interaction between horse and rider. However, not much was known thus far about the validity, reliability and usability of these devices for this purpose. Therefore, the first studies in this thesis focussed on this topic. The FSA system was only reliable in highly standardised circumstances. The Pliance system provided reliable and repeatable results and can be used indeed to study the interaction between horse and rider. In this thesis it was used to evaluate the effect of rider position on the force distribution beneath the saddle and to study the signals given by the rider to the horse performing lateral movements in dressage. One of the important physical properties of the rider that influences the horse is the rider’s weight. The effect of tack and weight on the movements of the horse was therefore studied. The introduction of a mass with considerable weight on the horse’s back induced an overall extension that might contribute to back injuries. During trot, the rider can either rise from the saddle during every stride (rising trot), or remain seated (<b>sitting</b> <b>trot).</b> The back movement during rising trot showed characteristics of both <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> and the unloaded condition, with a higher degree of extension during the sitting phase and less extension in the standing phase. In the standing phase peak force on the stirrups is higher, but the overall vertical peak force {{on the back of the}} horse is less. This supports the general assumption that rising trot is less demanding for the horse than <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> Three spring-(damper-) mass models were constructed to evaluate the biomechanical requirements the rider has to comply with during <b>sitting</b> <b>trot,</b> when using the modern riding technique adopted by jockeys during racing, and in rising trot. The models demonstrate which combinations of rider mass, spring stiffness and damping coefficient will result in these riding modes. Optimization to minimize the peak force of the rider and to minimize the work of the horse resulted in an “extreme” modern jockey technique, which is not adopted by actual riders. The incorporation of an active spring system for the leg of the rider, was needed to simulate the rising trot. The general discussion argues that the simultaneous use of a variety of approaches is required to further our understanding of the interaction between horse and rider. A combination of experimental research, which makes use of cutting-edge techniques to measure kinematics of horse and rider, forces acting between horse and rider and between horse and environment, and muscle activation patterns of both horse and rider, with mathematical modelling is the way forward. This combined approach could answer questions concerning the external and internal biomechanical loading of horse and rider of several horse riding and training techniques. Techniques that minimize risk of injury of both horse and rider could possibly be identified, reducing welfare problems of the equine athlete...|$|R

Data were collected from seven dressage horse/rider combinations at <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> on a high speed treadmill. Kinematics were recorded using a 12 -camera, infrared-based opto-electronic system. Three horses wore a rein tension meter. Behavioural registrations were made from video. Behavioural responses included lip movement, mouth movement, open mouth, change in ear position, head tilt and tail movement. Mouth movements were associated with the suspension phase of the trot.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Saddle fit is well recognised {{as an important}} factor for the health and performance of riding horses. However, only few studies have addressed general effects of different saddle construction details within a group of horses. Objective: To assess the influence of girth strap placement, traditional vs. v-system, and panel flocking material, wool vs. synthetic foam, on the saddle pressure pattern during riding. Methods: Six horses were ridden by 3 riders in <b>sitting</b> and rising <b>trot</b> and <b>sitting</b> canter. Saddle pressure was measured with 3 different saddle variants: 1) wool flocked panels and traditional girthing (baseline); 2) wool flocked panels and v-system girthing; and 3) foam filled panels and traditional girthing. From the pressure data, a number of descriptive variables were extracted. These were analysed using ANCOVAmodels with horse, rider, saddle, seat (sitting/rising, trot only) and speed as independent variables. Results: With foam filled panels stride maximum pressures under the hind part of the saddle increased by 7 – 12 % and the area under the saddle with a stride mean pressure > 11 kPa increased by 114 cm 2 in trot and 127 cm 2 in canter. With v-system girthing, the latter variable also increased, but only by 53 and 38 cm 2 in trot and canter, respectively. In addition, stride maximum pressures under the front part of the saddle tended to increase (! 9 %). Conclusions: Both flocking material and girthing have a significant influence on the saddle pressure and should thus be considered in saddle fitting. Wool seems a better flocking material than foam of the type used in the current study. For girthing, traditional placement seems equally good if not better than the v-system. However, further {{studies are needed to}} show if these results are valid for a larger population of riding horses...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} horse - saddle - rider {{interaction}} remains limited. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the effect of the rider's position at rising trot on the pressure distribution, spine movements, stirrups forces and locomotion of the horse. The horse's back movements were measured using IMUs fixed at the levels of thoracic (T 6, T 12, T 16) and lumbar (L 2, L 5) vertebrae, the pressure distribution using a pressure mat and stirrups forces using force sensors. The horse's and rider's approximated centres of mass (COM) were calculated using 2 D reflective markers. To compare both trot phases (rider seated/rider standing), three horses were trotted at the rising trot by the same rider. Means +- SD of each parameter for sitting and standing were compared using a Student's t test (p = 0. 05). Stirrups forces showed two peaks of equal magnitude in every stride cycle for left and right stirrups but increased during the standing phase. Simultaneously, the pressure for the whole mat significantly increased by + 3. 1 kPa during the sitting phase with respect to standing phase. The T 12 -T 16 and T 16 -L 2 angular ranges of motion (ROM) were significantly reduced (- 3. 2 ° - 1. 2 °) and the T 6 -T 12 and L 2 -L 5 ROM were significantly increased (+ 1. 7 ° + 0. 7 °) during sitting phase compared to standing phase. During rising <b>trot,</b> the <b>sitting</b> phase does not only ncrease the pressure on the horse's back but also reduces the back motion under the saddle compared to the standing phase.

2500|$|Rising or Posting: The rider {{makes an}} up-and-down {{movement}} each stride, {{rising out of}} the saddle for one beat and lowering (sits) for the second beat. When the rising trot is performed correctly, it is comfortable for the rider and easy on the horse. This is preferred for show jumping, hunt seat, eventing (the jumping phases), saddle seat, lower-level dressage, and most other English-type riding as well as endurance riding. Although this does not provide as much control as sitting, it frees the horse's back. In the rising trot, the rider allows the horse's movement to throw his or her seat a bit out of the saddle. When coming back down, the seat touches down lightly rather than slamming down on the horse's back. [...] Except in saddle seat riding, rider's shoulders maintain a slight forward incline throughout the rising trot, instead of the upright, vertical position seen in <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> The shoulders and lower legs remain in relatively the same position when the rider is both rising and sitting and the hands also stay in the same position as the rider rises and sits.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of tack (equipment such as saddles and reins) and {{especially}} of bits because of rein tension resulting in {{pressure in the}} mouth is questioned because of welfare concerns. We hypothesised that rein tension patterns in walk and trot reflect general gait kinematics, but are also determined by individual horse and rider effects. Six professional riders rode three familiar horses in walk and trot. Horses were equipped with rein tension meters logged by inertial measurement unit technique. Left and right rein tension data were synchronized with the gait. RESULTS: Stride split data (0 - 100 %) were analysed using mixed models technique to elucidate the left/right rein and stride percentage interaction, {{in relation to the}} exercises performed. In walk, rein tension was highest at hindlimb stance. Rein tension was highest in the suspension phase at trot, and lowest during the stance phase. In rising trot {{there was a significant difference}} between the two midstance phases, but not in <b>sitting</b> <b>trot.</b> When turning in trot there was a significant statistical association with the gait pattern with the tension being highest in the inside rein when the horse was on the outer fore-inner hindlimb diagonal.

40|$|In this study, we {{classify}} four horse gaits (walk, <b>sitting</b> <b>trot,</b> rising trot, canter) {{of three}} breeds of horse (Jeju, Warmblood, and Thoroughbred) using a neuro-fuzzy classifier (NFC) of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type from data information transformed by a wavelet packet (WP). The {{design of the}} NFC is accomplished by using a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm that can {{solve the problem of}} dimensionality increase due to the flexible scatter partitioning. For this purpose, we use the rider’s hip motion from the sensor information collected by inertial sensors as feature data for the classification of a horse’s gaits. Furthermore, we develop a coaching system under both real horse riding and simulator environments and propose a method for analyzing the rider’s motion. Using the results of the analysis, the rider can be coached in the correct motion corresponding to the classified gait. To construct a motion database, the data collected from 16 inertial sensors attached to a motion capture suit worn by one of the country’s top-level horse riding experts were used. Experiments using the original motion data and the transformed motion data were conducted to evaluate the classification performance using various classifiers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} the influence of rein contact and the movement of the rider’s hand on the horse’s behaviour, analysing data on horses ridden in two different head and neck positions. We hypothesized that the rider’s hand movements and rein tension generate behavioural responses from the horse, and more so when ridden on the bit compared to free and unrestrained. Data were collected from seven dressage horses/riders in <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> on a high-speed treadmill. Kinematics were recorded using a 12 -camera, infrared-based opto-electronic system. Behavioural recordings were made from video and three horses wore a rein tension meter. After stride split, data were standardised to 0 - 100 % stride duration. Mixed models were used to analyse how the behaviours varied over the stride cycle; trial within horse was treated as a random effect, while percentage of stride, rein tension and kinematic variables mainly related to the rider’s hand were entered as fixed effects. Behaviours discerned were lip movement, mouth movement, open mouth, ear position, head tilt and tail movement. Mouth movements were associated with the suspension phase of the trot and percentage of stride was highly significant (P< 0. 0001). Head and neck position was non-significant in the final models, while rein tension and the distance between the rider’s hand and the horse’s mouth affected the amount of mouth movements.

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The {{diagnosis}} of equine back disorders is challenging. Objectively determining {{movement of the}} vertebral column may therefore be of value in a clinical setting. OBJECTIVES: To establish whether surface-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs) {{can be used to}} establish normal values for range of motion (ROM) of the vertebral column in a uniform population of horses trotting under different conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Vertebral ROM was established in Franches-Montagnes stallions and a general population of horses and the variability in measurements compared between the two groups. Repeatability and the influence of specific exercise condition (on ROM) were assessed. Finally, attempts were made to explain the findings of the study through the evaluation of factors that might influence ROM. METHODS: Dorsoventral (DV) and mediolateral (ML) vertebral ROM was measured at a trot under different exercise conditions in 27 Franches-Montagnes stallions and six general population horses using IMUs distributed over the vertebral column. RESULTS: Variability in the ROM measurements was significantly higher for general population horses than for Franches-Montagnes stallions (both DV and ML ROM). Repeatability was strong to very strong for DV measurements and moderate for ML measurements. Trotting under saddle significantly reduced the ROM, with <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> resulting in a significantly lower ROM than rising trot. Age is unlikely to explain the low variability in vertebral ROM recorded in the Franches-Montagnes horses, while this may be associated with conformational factors. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to establish a normal vertebral ROM for a group of Franches-Montagnes stallions. While within-breed variation was low in this population, further studies are necessary to determine variation in vertebral ROM for other breeds and to assess their utility for {{diagnosis of}} equine back disorders...|$|R

The driver kept on to the stable with unslackened speed, and the line followed him, swishing and skating over the water, while the steersman put his helm hard aport, and the packet rounded to, and swam softly and slowly up to her moorings.

40|$|Like {{humans are}} {{right or left}} handed, studies support the theory that horses has the same natural bias that is innate. It is {{important}} that riders and trainers know if the horse has a natural asymmetry or whether an asymmetry is caused by pain, lameness. If the riders or trainers are able to detect new asymmetries or changes in the horse natural movement pattern in an early stage, {{it is possible that}} further damage is avoided. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare symmetry in horses unridden at trot on a straight line versus ridden and with different seats. The rider alters between left rising trot with contact on the reins, right rising trot with contact on the reins, light seat with minimal contact on the reins and <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> with contact. The questions asked in the study are if the riders make the horses more or less asymmetric? How does it affect the symmetry if the horse is ridden in the four different seats mentioned above? The 13 horses in the study are school horses used in the Equine Studies programme at The Swedish National Equestrian Centre Strömsholm. All horses were considered healthy by the owner and they were in full training in their discipline, show jumping or dressage on low to medium level. The method used to collect data for the study was the objective motion analysis system Lameness Locator. The horses were tested in five different situations during one long side in an indoor riding arena. The starting order for the different situations in each horse was randomized. Results show that the fact that there is a rider on the horse in itself does not influence the symmetry in the horses. In the light seat it does not influence the horse’s symmetry significantly either, but it becomes clear that both left and right rising trot has a significant impact on all of the horses’ symmetry. This is also supported by previous studies. By riding in rising trot the rider can make an asymmetry in the hindlimbs more visible or less visible depending on the horse’s natural symmetry and which hindlimb the rider sits on. The results of this study can only be applied on this group of horses with this kind of rider. How it affects the symmetry in younger or more unbalanced horses with a heavier or more unbalanced rider on needs further investigation.

40|$|The equine {{industry}} and within it, the competition rider community, is increasingly acknowledging that rider strength and fitness is vital in achieving {{the best results}} in competition. The sport of horse riding is described as unique in its posture and motion patterns and cannot be easily {{be compared to the}} actions of any other athletic endeavour. There are several factors that cause a horse to not move correctly, the most common being an unbalanced rider. Other sporting disciplines are more aware of the potential of the utilisation of additional methods to improve performance, for example Pilates is commonly used to develop optimal strength and balance in modern dance and ballet. In the absence of published work on the benefits of additional dismounted exercise on rider posture, this study aimed to determine a quantifiable measure to assess progress {{in the development of a}} novice mounted rider’s position using two different dismounted treatments to determine the key factors in promoting the benefits of a fitness programme. Students at Duchy College (n= 16) were divided into two treatment groups, Rider Specific training (n= 7) and Traditional Neuromuscular training (n= 9) and completed the allocated training regime for 8 weeks and 5 weeks respectively between 26 th January 2012 to 23 rd March 2012. Measurements were taken whilst subjects were mounted on horseback before any additional training treatment was administered, riding in walk, <b>sitting</b> <b>trot</b> and rising trot as well as on a weekly basis until the fitness programmes had been completed. A final data collection session was filmed upon conclusion of the additional fitness treatments. In addition to the mounted measurements, fitness data were collected using the 20 m shuttle run, resting heart rate and the sit and reach test before and after additional dismounted exercise. Each rider had 3 D spherical markers attached at specific anatomical landmarks; top of hat, shoulder, hip and heel. Using Quintic Sports Biomechanics Video Analysis Software package a vertical line was drawn through the hip marker and the deviation of each marker from this line was recorded. Leg length data were collected by measuring the distance between the hip and heel marker before and after the treatment sessions. All data were collated using MS Excel software and tested for normality of distribution using an Anderson Darling test in the Minitab™ v 16 statistical analysis package. If a normal distribution was present a paired t test was used to determine the extent of differences in all fitness tests and leg length pre- and post- fitness treatments. The deviations from the ear, shoulder, hip and heel (ESHH) alignment were not normally distributed. The deviation of the marker in relation to time, marker placement; gait and repeat stride were tested using a Friedman test. The comparison between rider (subject) and marker (factor) were analysed using a Kruskal Wallis test. For all statistical tests a probability of P 0. 05) or Bleep Test (BT) (t 1 = 2. 0; p> 0. 05) in the rider specific training group in comparison to the traditional neuromuscular training group that showed significant difference in the (RHR) and (BT) (t 5 = 6. 15; p 0. 05) in the traditional neuromuscular training (6. 3 ± 1. 5 (cm). Both Rider Specific training showed significant improvement in rider position (P< 0. 005) as well improvements in the Traditional Neuromuscular training treatment (P< 0. 005). Each gait had a significant effect on the deviation from the ESHH alignment (N= 16, H 2 = 221. 53; P< 0. 001). Both treatment groups demonstrated a similar significant effect (n= 7, H 2 = 133. 25; P< 0. 001, n= 9, H 2 = 101. 75; P< 0. 001) respectively. The deviation of markers in the rider specific training (n= 7, H 2 = 351. 38; P< 0. 001) displayed a significant difference of each markers deviation in line with the findings of the ball sports (n= 9, H 2 = 377. 48; P< 0. 001). Both treatments had a significant impact on mounted leg length, treatment group one, rider specific training (t 6 = - 7. 91; p= 0. 001) and treatment group two (t 2 = 3. 77; p< 0. 05) traditional neuromuscular training. This study demonstrated that additional dismounted exercise significantly (p< 0. 05) improves mounted rider position. It is reasonable to assume that the relationship between the treatment and decrease in deviation from the ESHH alignment is due to the general implementation of an additional exercise regime. However, the traditional neuromuscular training treatment group showed improvements at a quicker rate over the rider specific training group. The impact of personal participation was identified as a major contributing factor in using dismounted exercise in improving novice rider position and therefore assists in our understanding the role of exercise that could be most beneficial to further education equine students. Even though this study was undertaken on a relatively small sample of Further Education students, these findings suggest a role for additional team exercises in promoting fitness and improvement of mounted rider position in novice equine athletes.
