2500|$|In 1994, Bloom {{published}} The Western Canon, {{a survey}} of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focusing on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations and of the Western canon. Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, the major concern of the volume is reclaiming literature from those he refers to as the [...] "School of Resentment", the mostly academic critics who espouse a social purpose in reading. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal held by [...] "forces of resentment" [...] of improving one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: [...] "The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools." [...] His position is that politics have no place in literary criticism: a feminist or Marxist reading of Hamlet would <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>something</b> about feminism and Marxism, he says, but probably nothing about Hamlet itself.|$|E
