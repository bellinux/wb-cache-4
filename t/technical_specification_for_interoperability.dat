In the ACOUTRAIN project, procedures have been proposed for the transposition of pass-by measurement results for vehicle and track. This allows for transposition of pass-by data obtained at a non-compliant site to a TSI compliant track, or to another vehicle on the same track. Transposition of track or vehicle requires source separation of the rolling noise contributions of vehicle and track to the total pass-by level. Several methods will be discussed for this purpose, based on combinations of measurement results and calculations. A transposition method is illustrated and validated by a practical case, in which both the reference and the transposed situations have actually been measured...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that under gusty crosswind conditions, vehicle aerodynamic forces can lead to sudden changes in vehicle dynamics and stability. Large class vehicles, in particular, {{are more prone to}} rollover accidents in strong crosswind situations, especially at cruising speeds. It is therefore essential to conduct detailed investigations on the aerodynamic performance of commercial vehicles under crosswind conditions in order to improve their crosswind stability. This study predicts unsteady aerodynamic forces on a high-sided tractor-trailer unit exposed to gusty crosswind conditions. Although natural wind gusts are highly stochastic phenomena, and have a large variability in types and origins, this investigation suggests using deterministic gust model in combination with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based approach, using Large Eddy simulation (LES) for modeling air turbulence. Crosswind scenario with gusts of exponential shape, as specified in the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> <b>for</b> <b>Interoperability</b> (TSI), has been presented in the present study. A series of time-dependent aerodynamic interactions on the tractor-trailer unit have been recorded and investigated through the visualization of instantaneous gust flow structures around the truck-trailer unit. The results show that the TSI gust scenario has significant unsteady effects on the side aerodynamic force and the roll moment of the vehicle. Furthermore, there are significant variations in aerodynamic loads, consistent with the gust’s strength...|$|E
30|$|The EN 14531 (first draft 2003) {{describes}} the fundamental algorithms and calculations {{for the design}} of brake equipment for railway vehicles. The procedure provides the calculation of various aspects related to the performance: stopping or slowing distances, dissipated energy, force calculations, and immobilization braking. For the purposes of this work, the Part 6 of the regulation: “Application to high-speed trains” is of interest. The general algorithm to calculate braking distances is described in the regulation: the input data consist of train and brake characteristics, and the method to estimate the deceleration as a combination of different braking forces acting on the train is suggested {{as a function of the}} initial speed [1]. Moreover, the criteria for the technical and operational compatibility between the infrastructures and the rolling stock are defined in L. 245 / 402 <b>technical</b> <b>specification</b> <b>for</b> <b>interoperability</b> (TSI) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in 2002. The essential requirements for trans-European high-speed rail systems are related to safety, reliability, availability, health, environmental protection, and technical compatibility. Notably, the brake system requirements for high-speed rail systems are established; i.e., the minimum braking performance is defined as the minimum deceleration and evaluated as a function of speed [2]. On the other hand, the European norm UIC 544 - 1 (4 th edition, October 2004) defines the method for computation of the braking power through the braked mass and determination of the deceleration [3].|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} summering the master thesis work dealing with the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) study of the flow around a high-speed train. The model is a scaled 1 : 50 generic train with two cars, one inter-car gap and simplified bogies. A platform is set {{on the side of}} the train since one of the aim of the study is to look at the consequences of the phenomena in the wake on people or objects standing on the platform. The slipstream is one of this phenomena, it is due to the fact that the viscous air is dragged when the train is passing. If too strong, it can move or destabilize people or objects on the platform. In addition of the slipstream study, a velocity profile study, a drag and lift coefficients analyze as well as a Q-factor study and a frequency study have been realized. Some results of these different studies are compared with the ones obtained on the same model with a Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES). Since the flow is turbulent, for those different studies, the flow has been simulated with a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equation model (RANS) which is the k-ω SST model for the turbulence. The study of the slipstream allowed to calculate the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> <b>for</b> <b>Interoperability</b> (TSI) which must not be higher that the European Union requirement set at 15. 5 m/s, the result obtained is 8. 1 m/s which is then lower than the limit. The velocity profile shows similarities with the DDES results even though it is less detailed. The same conclusion is done for the Q-plot where is clearly visible the two counter-rotating vortices in the wake. Finally, a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm has been applied to instantaneous velocity results in the wake of the train in order to get the frequency of the aerodynamic phenomena in that wake. The main frequency is 25 Hz and corresponds to a Strouhal number of 0. 1, quite closed to the results obtained with DDES which is 0. 085. The results of the RANS and DDES are reasonably similar and by regarding at the large difference between the cell numbers (respectively 8 500 000 and 20 000 000) it can be conclude that in some ways the RANS model can be preferred at the DDES to save time for the computation but it does not contain the small scales resolved by the DDES...|$|E

Problems with flying gravel and its frictionless linear eddy current brake came up during testing. In order to limit the creation of tornado-like vortices that pick up gravel and to limit damage from flying gravel to the train, spoilers have been added under the car joints, under the carbody next to the bogies and under the powered axles on the bogies.The linear eddy current brake, which is required for higher speeds, cannot yet be used, because the magnetic field would rip off the magnetic covers of some trackside equipment; those covers {{will have to be}} replaced by non-magnetic ones according to the EU <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> <b>for</b> <b>Interoperability</b> <b>for</b> international rail traffic in Europe.|$|R
