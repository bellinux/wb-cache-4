5000|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (CINV) {{is a common}} side-effect of many cancer treatments. Nausea and vomiting {{are two of the}} most feared cancer treatment-related side effects for cancer patients and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side effects, respectively. Up to 20% of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments. [...] Since the 1990s, several novel classes of antiemetics have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to better manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients. Efficient mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient, and better overall health of the patient, and, due to better patient <b>tolerance,</b> <b>more</b> effective treatment cycles.|$|E

50|$|The radicalization and {{politicization}} of the movement occurred when the new king, Frederick William IV, upon whom the Young Hegelians had pinned their hopes of political reform, {{came to power in}} 1840 and curtailed political freedom and religious <b>tolerance</b> <b>more</b> than before. In philosophy the radicalization took the form of a breach with Hegel’s doctrine of the Prussian state as the fulfillment of history. In religion it manifested as a rejection of Christianity even in its most diluted pantheistic form and an adoption of atheism (led by Bauer and Feuerbach). In politics the Young Hegelians dropped much of Hegel's political theory {{and for the most part}} turned to republicanism - the exceptions being Moses Hess, who mixed Hegelianism with communism, and of course Marx and Engels. In all these areas a central change was the adoption of certain ideas of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, especially the notion that the self-transcendence of the world by man was a possibility and duty, but one that could never be conclusively fulfilled.|$|E

Nowhere is this immune <b>tolerance</b> <b>more</b> important than at the fetal-maternal interface – the decidua, the site of implantation and placentation. Indeed, many lines of evidence suggest an immunological origin to the common pregnancy-related disorder, preeclampsia.

This paper investigates manufacturing variability and its effect on first-stage turbine blades {{through the use of a}} parametric CAD model, automated CAD regeneration software, and a parametric finite element thermal model. The probabilistic approach used is substantiated due to differences that arise when input parameters vary at different levels, for example the engine-to-engine and blade-to-blade level. Schemes are proposed to improve robustness through tolerancing out input parameters in ranges of the distributions that make nonconformances more likely. A framework is presented for calculating the potential number of prevented non-conformances and the corresponding cost savings associated with various tolerancing schemes.
