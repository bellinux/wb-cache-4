5000|$|... "The bomb {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel container, painted grey, varnished internally, 3-3/4 in. in diameter, 9 in. high, weighing 6 lb. ... It holds 3½ lb. (about 2 pints) of mustard gas. Bombs will be issued, complete with ejection charges, in boxes of ten weighing 75 lb. The bomb is fitted with a metal lid 2in. deep {{which is a good}} push fit on the body. This lid is fastened to the body by adhesive tape. In the centre of the underside of the lid is a striker for use on the match composition head of the ejection charge. ... At one end of the bomb is a screwed plug. This is the filling plug. In order that any leakage may be readily detected the plug is coated with detector paint. ... When the lid is removed the ejection charge will be seen. It {{consists of}} about 1/7 oz. of gunpowder connected by 32 in. of safety fuze to the match composition head. This length of fuze gives a delay of two minutes. The safety fuze is coiled in concentric circles in a shallow metal saucer and is set in bakelite cement. ... The ejection charge has therefore the appearance of a circular plate 3½ in. in diameter. On the lower side is a <b>threaded</b> <b>boss</b> closed by a tin plate disc. This boss screwes into the bomb, the gunpowder charge being just above the tin plate disc. On the upper side of the ejection charge in the centre there is a flatened projection used for screwing the ejection charge into the bomb. The charge is also housed in the projection. On the rim there is another smaller projection holding the match composition head. The ejection charge is designed to blow out the end of the bomb fitted with the filling plug." ...|$|E
5000|$|E-type : This type front derailleurs do not clamp {{around the}} frame's seat tube, but instead are {{attached}} to the frame by a plate mounted under the drive side bottom bracket cup and a screw <b>threaded</b> into a <b>boss</b> on the seat tube. These derailleurs are usually found on mountain bikes with rear suspension components that do not allow space for a normal derailleur's clamp to go around the seat tube.|$|R
50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a barrel nut, barrel bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally <b>threaded.</b> The <b>boss</b> sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|R
40|$|An ultra-lightweight Propellant Manage-ment Device (PMD) was {{required}} for an interplanetary mission, and a new PMD development program was conducted to design, fabricate, and test this PMD. The PMD is designed for installation into a customer-supplied tank shell. There are several unusual features about this PMD: (1) it contains both pressurant inlet and propellant outlet ports, (2) the PMD is installed into a <b>threaded</b> outlet <b>boss,</b> (3) {{the weight of the}} PMD must be no more than 0. 1 kg (0. 22 lbm), and (4) the PMD is designed for horizontal ground operations and launch. PMD performance analysis was conducted to design this PMD, and PMD structural analysis was performed to validate the PMD design. This PMD was made from all-titanium components, including porous screens. Only existing processes and procedures were used during the fabrication process. The PMD was bubble point tested prior to delivery. All PMDs have been delivered to the customer...|$|R
