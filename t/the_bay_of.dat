60|$|Early {{one morning}} a terrible sound rang through the Green Forest and brought Lightfoot {{to his feet}} with a startled jump.

Many times he had listened to <b>the</b> <b>baying</b> <b>of</b> Bowser <b>the</b> Hound, as he followed Reddy Fox. It had not sounded so terrible then because it meant no danger to Lightfoot.|$|R

5|$|In late September 1933, {{the ship}} left <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Kotor and sailed through the Turkish Straits to Constanța on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, where she {{embarked}} King Alexander and Queen Maria of Yugoslavia.

6000|$|Soon <b>the</b> <b>baying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hounds {{appeared}} to pass below and beyond us, up the canyon to our right, a circumstance that worried Copple.

The narrowing walls of the canyon threw the echoes back and forth.|$|R

5|$|The {{southwest}} monsoon {{arrives in}} two branches: <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times stronger than <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal branch. The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the Malabar Coast of Kerala. By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. <b>The</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from Cape Comorin to Orissa, swerves {{to the northwest}} towards the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By {{the first week of}} July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, Northeast India receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.|$|E

5000|$|Another nod to Comus {{was given}} on the 2005 Opeth album Ghost Reveries.
