The lever {{is linked to}} the valve gear piston inside the high pressure steam port. The steam pressure faucet is closed to cut off power, and after coming to a halt, the valve gear piston could safely be moved a short distance using the lever as a fulcrum linked to the piston inside. Although the linkage was designed to give leverage, the Johnson Bar would take a firm throw to move and lock in position. Some locomotives had a screw reversing gear instead.|$|R

5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>reverser</b> is in <b>the</b> {{forward or}} <b>reverse</b> position, <b>the</b> {{locomotive}} will {{move in the}} indicated direction when the throttle is opened.

50|$|A Johnson Bar is {{a control}} lever on a steam locomotive, {{used to control}} {{the timing of the}} {{admission}} of steam into the locomotive's pistons.

50|$|The 7th Class {{represented}} a considerable advance {{in design and}} power. They were the first South African locomotives to be equipped with sight feed lubricators which allowed a sight glass to be positioned in the cab, where the rate of oil feed to the cylinders could be observed. <b>The</b> <b>reversing</b> gear was of the quick-threaded screw type instead of <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> which had earlier been used.|$|R
50|$|A {{reversing}} mechanism of some type has been present on locomotives almost since inception. <b>The</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> on a steam locomotive {{is sometimes called}} a Johnson Bar. <b>The</b> style of <b>reverser</b> used on internal combustion locomotives has been in use {{since at least the}} early 1900s but as late as 1996 patented improvements have been made to the design and operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{operation}} combines two motions; {{one is the}} primary lead motion which is imparted {{at the bottom of}} the combination lever (12). The secondary is the directional/amplitude motion which is imparted at the top. Consider that the driver has adjusted <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> such that <b>the</b> die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam.

5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{normally have}} the throttle (North American English) or regulator (British English) in a characteristic steam dome {{at the top}} of the boiler (although not all boilers feature these). The additional height afforded by the dome helps to avoid any liquid (e.g. from bubbles on the surface of the boiler water) being drawn into the throttle valve, which could damage it, or lead to priming. The throttle is basically a poppet valve, or series of poppet valves which open in sequence to regulate the amount of stream admitted to the steam chests over the pistons. It is used in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> to start, stop and to control the locomotive's power although, during steady-state running of most locomotives, it is preferable to leave the throttle wide open and to control the power by varying the steam cut-off point (which is done with <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever),</b> as this is more efficient. A steam locomotive throttle valve poses a difficult design challenge as it must be opened and closed using hand effort against the considerable pressure (typically 250psi) of boiler steam (one of the primary reasons for later multiple-sequential valves...it is far easier to open a small poppet valve against the pressure differential, and open the others once pressure begins to equalize than to open a single large valve, especially as steam pressures eventually exceeded 200 or even 300 psi. Examples include the balanced [...] "double beat" [...] type used on Gresley A3 Pacifics.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, a screw {{reverser}} {{is sometimes}} called a “bacon slicer”, particularly the type fitted to BR Standard locomotives. In <b>the</b> US, a <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> is called a “Johnson bar”.|$|R
50|$|To get the {{locomotive}} moving, a hand-controlled high-pressure steam valve was provided, {{by means of}} which the driver could admit a proportion of high-pressure steam into the low-pressure cylinders. Although it was intended by its designers as a starting device only, the direct steam valve was consistently misused by drivers to help them over heavy grades, {{at the expense of}} operating efficiency and of their fireman. According to the Vauclian notes, {{the locomotive}}s were to be driven on <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> in such conditions, but that was clearly not a practice used by VR staff at the time. Due to the consequent high cost of maintenance, the entire class was rebuilt as simple expansion locomotives between 1912 and 1913.|$|R
50|$|Like the W class 2-8-0 Consolidation, {{there was}} no cab deck behind the backhead, the fireman shoveled coal from the tender deck and, along with the engineer, sat beside the firebox because the firebox came right {{to the back of}} the cab. The {{throttle}} lever hung down over the shoulder of <b>the</b> firebox, <b>the</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>lever</b> was in front of the engineer against the side of the firebox, with the water glass just above. The injector controls (A water valve, the overflow valve, and the operating lever.) were in front of him against the outer wall of the cab. Although slightly cramped, visibility to the front was superb. On the fireman's side, there was a water glass, injector controls, and a drop seat arranged like the engineer's.|$|R

50|$|The driver {{suffered}} major {{injury to}} his arms, {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> screw <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> whipping around when he released it. The accident brought to light the importance of train crews being trained on the specific locomotives they were driving, rather than simply a common general instruction on steam locomotives. Neither the driver or fireman had ever worked 60532 before, and were unaware of the locomotive's sensitivity to priming, which led to the accident.|$|R
5000|$|In the Gooch {{valve gear}} (invented by Daniel Gooch in 1843) <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> and cut-off {{functions}} were achieved by raising or lowering a radius rod which connected the valve-rod to a [...] "stationary" [...] link pivoting around a fixed point. The advantages sought were reduced height for the gear and lighter action as <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> was only required {{to lift the}} weight of the radius rod. This meant that the link was convex (in relation to the eccentrics) instead of concave. Gooch valve gear had the disadvantage of angularity between the valve spindle and the eccentric rod in full gear, whereas the best forms of the Stephenson gear, the thrust was in a straight line. The Gooch gear gave constant lead at whatever cutoff. This was observed to be a disadvantage when similar locomotives fitted with either Gooch or Stephenson gear were compared in service Gooch gear was never popular in Britain except with one or two engineers down to the 1860s, but it was quite common in France.|$|R
50|$|Only paper railroads {{never have}} {{accident}}s, and the Rochester and State Line Railroad was no paper tiger. Some {{of the accident}} accounts surviving to this day leave much unsaid, such as the 13 June 1878 report that Locomotive No 7 ran over two cows between Salamanca and Gainesville on its very first trip. Others are frighteningly graphic (by today's tame standards) and could have been taken from cheap Hollywood scripts. Case in point: on or about 29 January 1879, Train No 2 departed Salamanca headed for Ellicottville when its encounter with a washout tossed the locomotive into the water. The fireman managed to escape the wreckage, but the engineer was caught by one foot trapped between <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> and <b>the</b> firebox. He desperately struggled to keep his head above water and to avoid a stream of very hot water coming from a burst pipe in the cab. By {{the time he was}} rescued hours later, the water had risen to his chin.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, {{four more}} {{of this type of}} boiler were ordered when No.87 was {{constructed}} out of Class A No.63 and Nos.72 and 73 were rebuilt from Class U to U2. The remaining boiler was presumably to have a been a spare one to enable speed shopping of engines but in the event it was immediately fitted to No.78. This engine was the last of the NBL engines to be built in 1924 but she had run a considerably greater mileage (442681 mi) than other members of the class by the time she received the new boiler in October 1936. No.70 did not have its footplate altered when it was rebuilt from Class U to U2; the short footplate made it unpopular with locomotive crews as the cab became very warm in summer and the position of some of the controls, especially <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever,</b> was cramped. It had the same nominal weight, 51 long tons 10 cwt (115400 lb), {{as the rest of the}} class, ...|$|R
5000|$|Its most {{distinguishing}} feature {{was that the}} cab and firebox were {{at the front of}} the locomotive instead of the traditional rear. This was done essentially by running a 2-8-8-4 machine backwards with myriad modifications. The engineer and fireman swapped sides and faced away from the firebox. The tender was moved to behind the [...] "new" [...] locomotive back to improve forward vision. The smoke box end coupling was strengthened. <b>The</b> power <b>reverse</b> <b>lever</b> (Johnson Bar) and the steam throttle motion direction was <b>reversed.</b> <b>The</b> drive wheel axles are reversed, end for end without rekeying the return [...] "fly" [...] cranks, to <b>reverse</b> <b>the</b> expansion link timing on both sides.|$|R
2500|$|A {{preliminary}} NTSB advisory says: [...] "The flying pilot (Captain) {{stated that}} he could not get <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust <b>levers</b> out of the stowed position. The first officer, after several seconds, noticed that the thrust reversers were not deployed, and activated the reversers without a problem. [...] Flight data recorder information reveals that the thrust reversers were not deployed until 18 seconds after touchdown, at which point there was only about 1,000 feet of usable runway remaining." ...|$|R
50|$|The MAK's {{preliminary}} report, {{issued the}} week of 25 September 2006, attributed the accident to pilot error, while finding {{that there was no}} problem with the engines or the aircraft.The autopilot and thrust controller were switched off by the crew at a height of 100m and could not have any effect on the landing and landing run. The couplings linking the thrust controller to the engine control linkage were uncoupled and were not connected to the linkage any more. No steering commands given by the thrust controller computer were recorded. The results of the investigation of the electronic guidance and engine control system (FADEС) testify to the efficiency of the system right up to when the airplane collided with the barriers. The airplane landed in the touchdown zone at Irkutsk airport at 22:43:40 in wheel control mode with engines running at idle. After landing, the spoilers were automatically deployed and the automatic braking system (ABS) was automatically switched on in LOW mode. 1.5 seconds after touchdown, the airplane captain set <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust <b>lever</b> for <b>the</b> right engine to <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> mode. <b>The</b> right engine correctly went into <b>reverse</b> thrust mode. <b>The</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust <b>lever</b> for <b>the</b> left engine was not applied.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of 1901-1903, five more Bs were built in Addington Workshops, with the last {{entering}} service in May 1903. The locomotives were advanced for their time, featuring a new piston valve design and a modified form of Walschaerts valve gear, and {{they were designed to}} haul 600 LT freight trains on flat lines and 220 LT on the hilly section of the Main South Line between Oamaru and Dunedin. For the time, these were quite significant figures. The Addington engines were unusual in the fact that they employed a screw reverse configuration, instead of <b>the</b> standard <b>reversing</b> <b>lever.</b> They also had fold down seats for both driver and fireman.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular valve drive for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever.</b> This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because <b>the</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of <b>the</b> screw <b>reverser.</b> A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|R
50|$|A better {{solution}} was to use a single double-sided gab. These were initially X-shaped and sat between the two connecting pins. X-gabs were also usually <b>reversed,</b> so that <b>the</b> gab {{was placed on the}} valve spindle and the pins were instead connected to the eccentric rods. The gab now stayed still vertically and the pins were moved up and down to engage them. This was done by joining both pins with a short vertical bar. <b>The</b> driver's <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> moved <b>the</b> centre of this bar, thus the pins, up and down to engage one at a time with opposite faces of the X-gab. This valve gear was used on Stephenson's locomotives of the early 1830s, such as Rocket.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, during <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust <b>lever</b> for <b>the</b> right {{engine was}} being moved forward (to reduce <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust), <b>the</b> {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the {{throttle control lever}} for the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). <b>The</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust of <b>the</b> right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The throttle control lever for the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward thrust setting of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|R
5000|$|This device {{inspired}} the Marquess of Stafford {{to order a}} steam carriage - probably in 1859. This vehicle had three wheels, the single wheel at the front, and a rear-mounted coal-fired boiler and two-cylinder engine. The boiler pressure was 110 psi, and the cylinders had a bore of 76 mm and stroke of 178 mm. Transmission was by chain to the right-hand rear wheel. A maximum speed of 19 mph was claimed. A boilerman was seated at the rear, and three passengers could sit side by side at the front with {{the one on the}} right operating a tiller steering and <b>the</b> regulator, <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> and brake. <b>The</b> wheels had iron [...] "tyres", with the brakes operating on the rear wheels.|$|R
2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow <b>reversing</b> <b>the</b> engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. <b>The</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|R
