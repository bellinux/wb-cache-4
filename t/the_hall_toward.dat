Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E

The atmosphere of night quietude had been disturbed. She wondered what servant could be prowling about. Not the butler, who was notorious for retiring early save on special occasion. Nor could it be her maid, whom she had permitted to go that evening.|$|E

I was {{ushered into}} the office of General Arthur MacArthur, {{the father of the}} hero of the Battle of the Philippines. ... interpreter... told General MacArthur in English what I had said in Spanish, namely, that I was {{instructed}} by General Mascardo to find out if General Aguinaldo had been captured. The American General, who stood erect and towered over my head, raised his hand without saying a word and pointing to the room across the hall, made a motion for me to go in there. Trembling with emotion, I slowly walked through <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> the room hoping against hope that I would find no one inside. At the door two American soldiers in uniform, with gloves and bayonets, stood on guard. As I entered the room, I saw General Aguinaldo the man whom I had considered as the personification of my own beloved country, the man whom I had seen {{at the height of his}} glory surrounded by generals and soldiers, statesmen and politicians, the rich and the poor, respected and honored by all. I now saw that same man alone in a room, a prisoner of war! It is impossible for me to describe what I felt, but as I write these lines, forty-two years later, my heart throbs as fast as it did then. I felt that the whole world had crumbled; that all my hopes and dreams for my country were gone forever! It took me some time before I could collect myself, but finally, I was able to say in Tagalog, almost in a whisper, to my General: Good evening, Mr. President.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} a royal {{messenger}} {{brought out a}} packet of letters to Furness Hall, and Harry, mounting {{with his father and}} the little body of horse at <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> rode <b>toward</b> London. His attire was that of a country peasant boy. The letters were concealed in the hollow of a stout ashen stick which he carried, and which had been slightly weighted with lead, so that, should it be taken up by any but its owner, its lightness would not attract attention. Sir Henry rode with him as far as it was prudent to do toward the outposts of the Parliament troops. Then, bidding him a tender farewell, and impressing upon him the necessity for the utmost caution, both for his own sake and for that of the king, he left him.|$|R
40|$|The European {{scenario}} {{has long}} driven {{the proliferation of}} places of retail on public areas. Usually they have been characterized by a mature integration of retail services, administration, culture, education and shared time and by a significant component of service and added value introduced through not necessarily sectorial projects and policies. This paper gives an in-depth research and a critical comparison between the current economic, urban and cultural dynamics that are progressively driving regeneration and physical transformation of <b>the</b> market <b>halls</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> qualitative configuration of urban centres of integrated services of proximity (local services). In this framework, also the Italian context is giving life to some interesting phenomena of spatial and product reorganization of municipal markets. From their original function of moderating prices and facilitating the matching of demand and supply, these particular facilities of the public city are increasingly diversifying themselves as practical tools for urban renovation, capable of improving the social relations among citizens, subjects of cultural promotion and local economic operators, often in the peripheral parts of the city...|$|R
60|$|He {{ran down}} <b>the</b> deserted <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> red lamp which he knew {{indicated}} {{the place of}} a fire-escape. The door of the room beside it was open. In the room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a pile of clothing. He ran to the window, could not get it up, but smashed it with a chair, and stepped out on the landing of the fire-escape; below him was a crowd of men, with a sprinkling of women and youth, massed in a ruddy light. Must he go down in his spectral night dress? No--this side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end; he would snatch on those clothes. Which he did. They fitted well enough, though a trifle loosely, and they were just a shade loud as to pattern. Also as to hat--which was of a new breed to him, Buffalo Bill not having been to England yet. One side of the coat went on, but the other side refused; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder. He started down without waiting to get it loose, made the trip successfully, and was promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the police.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research, 1997 Living in {{a college}} {{residence}} hall setting gives many people the opportunity to experience the homosexual community, either through the acknowledgment of their own homosexuality or the acknowledgment of another's homosexuality. The discovery of new sexualities can be an exciting experience for some, but may be an uncomfortable one for others, eliciting {{a wide range of}} attitudes toward homosexuals. As living in <b>the</b> residence <b>halls</b> can be a very confining experience, assessing attitudes toward a segment of that population seems relevant. Gender of the respondent, gender of the target homosexual, quality of experiences with homosexuals, and affective responses toward sexually explicit material were all expected to be related with attitudes toward homosexuals. 179 undergraduate students living in <b>the</b> residence <b>halls</b> of a small west coast university were given three surveys: the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men scale (Herek, 1988), the Short-Form Homosexism scale (Hansen, 1982), and the Revised form of the Sexual Opinion Survey (Fisher, Byrne, White, and Kelley, 1988). In addition, respondents were also asked to give their opinion of the atmosphere in <b>the</b> residence <b>halls</b> <b>toward</b> gay men, lesbian women, and bisexuals, as well as whether or not they themselves knew of any homosexuals or bisexuals, and give a positive to negative rating of the quality of these experiences with homosexuals and bisexuals has been. While {{there were no significant differences}} based on sexual orientation in how <b>the</b> residence <b>hall</b> atmosphere for nonheterosexual residents was viewed, gender of respondent and gender of target homosexual were found to correlate with attitudes toward homosexuals. Affective responses toward sexually explicit material and quality of experiences were also found to correlate with attitudes toward homosexuals. Implications for residence hall policy and suggestions for future research are presented along with a discussion of each finding...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe quantum Hall effect (QHE) and the Shubnikov-de Haas {{effect in}} the QHE regime are {{investigated}} experimentally using modulation doped n-type GaAs/GaAlAs quantum wells additionally doped in the well with beryllium. It is known that acceptor states introduced by Be atoms have a localized character in the conduction band due to a combined effect of the well and a magnetic field parallel to the growth direction and that they possess discrete energies above the corresponding conduction Landau levels. It is presently shown that the localized magnetoacceptor (MA) states lead to two observable effects in magnetotransport in the ultraquantum limit: magnetic thaw down and magnetic boil-off of two-dimensional (2 D) electrons. Both effects {{are related to the}} fact that electrons occupying localized MA states cannot conduct. Thus in the thaw down effect the electrons fall down from the MA states to the free Landau states, which leads to a shift of <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> plateau <b>toward</b> higher magnetic fields as a consequence of an increase of the 2 D electron density Ns. In the boil-off effect the electrons are pushed from the free Landau states to the MA states which leads to a dramatic increase of resistance, {{as a consequence of the}} decrease of Ns. Differences between the above effects and those induced by magnetodonors in 2 D systems are emphasized. We analyze the magnetic boil-off effect theoretically assuming that it is caused by <b>the</b> quantum <b>Hall</b> electric field present in our experiments. It is demonstrated that a sufficiently strong electric field in the crossed-field configuration can indeed populate localized MA states above the Landau levels...|$|R

50|$|On October 22, 2014, {{members of}} the House of Commons {{protection}} services and the RCMP were instrumental in stopping an armed man who had stormed the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. Constable Son was stationed at the front entrance when he spotted the man entering with a concealed rifle. The constable lunged {{to gain control of}} the firearm, but it discharged and struck him in the leg. Drawn to the Rotunda by the noise, Corporal Malo and Constable Thom took cover and exchanged several rounds with the gunman after he entered the building. Constable LÃ©tourneau tracked the gunman down <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Honour <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Library of Parliament and fired at him several times. RCMP Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett, Bergeron, Bubelis, CÃ©lestin, Fraser, Marcoux, Palmer, Ruest and Waye, who had assembled outside the Peace Tower, entered the Centre Block. Supported by their colleagues, Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett and Fraser assumed a tactical formation (IARD) as they charged down <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Honour. With the shooter now cornered in an alcove leading to the Library, Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, after being advised of the shooterâs location, dove to {{the floor in front of}} him and fired his weapon. RCMP Constable Barrett walked directly toward the gunman while also firing his weapon. The collective actions of these 16 individuals brought the incident to an end in less than three minutes, and avoided further tragedy.|$|R
