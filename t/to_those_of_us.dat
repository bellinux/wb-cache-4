5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who'd heard her speak.|$|E
25|$|Maier “returned to his Creator {{for entry}} into life everlasting” at 12:25a.m. on January 11, 1950. He left behind a {{bereaved}} widow and two sons.

At {{the time of his}} death, The Lutheran Hour that he founded had become the largest regular broadcast – secular or religious – in the history of radio. His books and transcriptions of those sermons are available online today.|$|E
25|$|Although an American citizen {{for many}} years, Joe McManus {{continued}} {{to visit his}} Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings {{in spite of the}} numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is a good reason for Canadians to remember him. <b>To</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E

At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration {{for all of us}} to act when we can and to have the courage to help those who are suffering and in need of help".

500|$|In {{the years}} before World War II, most of the units of the 1st Cavalry Division that were not {{assigned}} to larger unit commands were {{under the control of}} the Headquarters, Division Special Troops of the division; an independent unit for various supporting units for a division. These included the service and support elements of the division. After World War II, however, the Special Troops Headquarters was reorganized into Headquarters, Division Trains. This designation immediately predates the [...] "Division Support Command" [...] (DISCOM) designation. The division trains were activated 1 November 1957 in Korea.

500|$|Further {{evaluation}} of the remaining aircraft took place during 1979. Wing Commander (and later Air Vice-Marshal) Bob Richardson test-flew a Mirage2000 in April 1979, and reported that while the aircraft had excellent aerodynamic characteristics, its avionics, radar, fuel system, cockpit and weapons capability were inferior <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> designs. Richardson also test-flew a YF-17 that was {{being used as a}} demonstrator for the F-18L in mid-1979, and was impressed by its capabilities. No F-18Ls had been ordered at this time, however, and the RAAF did not want to take on the risk of being the lead customer for the design. At about the same time, the RAAF rejected an offer of F-14 Tomcats that had been originally ordered by the Iranian Government but not delivered {{as a result of the}} revolution in that country. While the Tomcats were made available at a greatly reduced price, the air force judged that these aircraft were too large and complex for its requirements.|$|E

500|$|Freehance writer Paul De Witte wrote a mixed {{review in}} The Record (now the Waterloo Region Record), writing that {{although}} the book [...] "will certainly find its audience, its Disneyesque sensibilities will kill its broader appeal. The topics of wildlife conservation and global ecological accountability warrant a depth that the author seems unwilling to give her book." [...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles {{to even the most}} stubbornly objective reader." [...] Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively [...] "anthropomorphic", but also that [...] "Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats." ...|$|E

The 1942 Casablanca centers on the development of conscience in the cynical American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in the face of oppression by the Nazis and the example of the resistance leader Victor Laszlo.The David Lean and Robert Bolt screenplay for Doctor Zhivago (an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel) focuses strongly on the conscience of a doctor-poet {{in the midst of the}} Russian Revolution (in the end [...] "the walls of his heart were like paper").The 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner focuses on the struggles of conscience between and within a bounty hunter (Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford)) and a renegade replicant android (Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)) in a future society which refuses to accept that forms of artificial intelligence can have aspects of being such as conscience.|$|E
50|$|The {{funding for}} this {{magazine}} is dubious. Its editorial line is parallel <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> Foreign policy {{in almost every}} aspect.

According to a 2014 survey commissioned by Variety, PewDiePie {{along with a few}} other YouTube personalities have been reported to be more influential and popular than mainstream celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, among US teenagers aged 13 through 18. His rise to fame has been used as [...] "a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas, courage, and, of course, a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society." [...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest".

500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

40|$|Philip Pettit claims his neorepublican {{theory of}} freedom as non-domination is {{preferable}} to the liberal ideal of non-interference, and he is right. But the reasons why he is right run deeper than is apparent if we attend solely to his arguments defending non-domination in negative terms. In fact, embedded in the three benefits that Pettit claims non-domination can offer (which non-interference cannot) lie significant resonances with a positive idea of freedom concerned with a person’s sense of agency. We find such an idea in Charles Taylor, where freedom as self-realization is intricately linked with his “significance view” of human agency. By adopting this Taylorian lens and assessing Pettit’s non-domination, I show that non-domination does have much <b>to</b> offer <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who think <b>of</b> freedom primarily in positive terms and, more generally, <b>to</b> all <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who believe that freedom and agency are inextricably linked and must be treated as such...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the modifications needed for Australian standards and market requirements, changes included the use of [...] "local content" [...] sourced parts and components (such as seats, carpeting, lights, heaters, and even unique [...] "R"-logo wheel covers) that reduced the tariff added to each car. All AMI Matadors were right-hand drive and continued to use the dash and instrument dials of the U.S 1967 Rambler Ambassador. Also reused throughout the whole production run was the split-bench front seat and door cards of the U.S 1971 Matador which were both Australian-made. Despite the reused interior, all exterior model year changes corresponded <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> production As red rear flashers were prohibited in Australia, amber-coloured trailer lights were retrofitted {{to the rear of}} all AMI-assembled Matadors, drilled into the tail gate of the station wagons or mounted over or behind the reversing lens of the tail light assembly of the sedans, and then re wired so the turn signals would flash orange.|$|E
