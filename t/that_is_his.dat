25|$|The Privy Council {{ordered the}} arrest of both Howard and Arundell; De Vere {{immediately}} met secretly with Arundell to convince him to support his allegations against Howard and Southwell, offering him money and a pardon from the Queen. Arundell refused De Vere's offer, and he and Howard initially sought asylum with Mendoza. Only after being assured they would be placed under house arrest {{in the home of}} a Privy Council member, did the pair give themselves up. During the first weeks after their arrest they pursued a threefold strategy: they would admit to minor crimes, prove De Vere a liar by his offers of money to testify to his accusations, and demonstrate that their accuser posed the real danger to the Crown. The extensive list to discredit De Vere included atheism, lying, heresy, disobedience to the crown, treason, murder for hire, sexual perversion and pederasty with his English and Italian servants ("buggering a boy <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> cook and many other boys"), habitual drunkenness, vowing to murder various courtiers and declaring that Elizabeth had a bad singing voice.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp {{was opened}} to public {{subscription}} in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, {{as the other}} thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were {{paid for by the}} nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts’s valuation of those assets was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association’s debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short term loans and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent. Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also {{under the terms of the}} agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>his</b> 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.|$|E
25|$|Round 3 – Ptolomaea: {{the third}} region of Cocytus {{is named after}} Ptolemy, who invited his {{father-in-law}} Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark Atropos has cut their thread"). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, Bolgia 5) and had him cut to pieces. Branca (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>his</b> earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice ("And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness").|$|E

500|$|So Beautiful or So What {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 27 reviews. Many critics compared its diverse influences to Simon's style on his 1986 album Graceland. In a review for AllMusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said {{the music is}} not only focused but [...] "vivid, vibrant, and current in a way none of [...] peers have managed to achieve". Los Angeles Times writer Margaret Wappler praised its [...] "multiethnic landscape" [...] of American folk and Afropop influences on an album <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> best since 1990's Rhythm of the Saints. In The New York Times, Jon Pareles took note of Simon's lyrics: [...] "Sketches of individuals and moments are intertwined with grander pronouncements; unforced humor tempers gloomier reflections". Will Hodgkinson from The Times believed his meditations on the afterlife are informed by both youthful enthusiasm and the wisdom of old age, while The Guardians Maddy Costa said Simon [...] "finds {{an answer to the}} ineffable in song".|$|E
500|$|Writing for School Library Journal, Benjamin Russell {{criticized the}} series for being [...] "slow and formulaic" [...] with [...] "similarly formulaic" [...] {{character}} designs that made [...] "it seem staid". He {{also stated that}} the [...] "animal world" [...] portrayed could be fun {{and that it was}} [...] "interesting to see humanoid characters so tiny next to artifacts of human culture", but it failed to hold the reader's interest. Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story, grading it as an [...] "F" [...] and calling it [...] "a pastiche {{of a large number of}} manga and anime clichés, not because it seems like it was intended to be a pastiche, but because the manga artist [...] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent, unified storyline <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> own, original creation." [...] However, Brienza did praise the artwork, grading it as an [...] "A" [...] and calling it rich and [...] "beautifully drawn". In , Jason Thompson notes that the series' [...] "hook" [...] is that characters are all [...] "drawn as hot anthropomorphic cat-girls and cat-boys" [...] and praises it for having a [...] "unique twist".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} famous Welsh poetic {{references}} to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death-songs known as Y Gododdin (The Gododdin), attributed to 6th-century poet Aneirin. One stanza praises the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies, but says that despite this, [...] "he was no Arthur" [...] – <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>his</b> feats cannot compare to the valour of Arthur. Y Gododdin is known only from a 13th-century manuscript, so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation, but John Koch's view that the passage dates from a 7th-century or earlier version is regarded as unproven; 9th- or 10th-century dates are often proposed for it. Several poems attributed to Taliesin, a poet said to have lived in the 6th century, also refer to Arthur, although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries. They include [...] "Kadeir Teyrnon" [...] ("The Chair of the Prince"), which refers to [...] "Arthur the Blessed"; [...] "Preiddeu Annwn" [...] ("The Spoils of Annwn"), which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld; and [...] "Marwnat vthyr pen" [...] ("The Elegy of Uther Pen"), which refers to Arthur's valour and is suggestive of a father-son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.|$|E

500|$|Valve {{does not}} release any sales figures for its Steam service; it only {{provides}} {{the data to}} companies with games on Steam, which they cannot release without permission because of a non-disclosure agreement with Valve. However, Stardock, the previous owner of competing platform Impulse, estimated that as of 2009, Steam had a 70% share of the digital distribution market for video games. In early 2011, Forbes reported that Steam sales constituted 50–70% of the [...] market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of 70% of purchase price, compared with 30% at retail. Steam's success has led to some criticism because of its support of DRM and for being an effective monopoly. Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman commented on the issue following the announcement that Steam would come to Linux; he said that while he supposes that its release can boost GNU/Linux adoption leaving users better off than with Microsoft Windows, he stressed that he sees nothing wrong with commercial software but {{that the problem is}} that Steam is unethical for not being free software and that its inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions teaches the users that the point is not freedom and thus works against the software freedom <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> goal.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene that}} {{corresponds}} with [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while {{stuck in the}} air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> role {{and there is nothing}} to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, {{he would not be able}} to walk as he is a [...] "straw paper dummy". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their [...] "Crow Commandments": [...] "Thou shall honor all crows", [...] "Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature" [...] and [...] "Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, [...] "You Can't Win". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing [...] "Ease on Down the Road" [...] as they go.|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} of the {{delusion}} of Sati in Ramcharitmanas, Sati sees many a Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu serving Rama and bowing at his feet. When Manu and Shatarupa perform penance, they crave to see that Supreme Lord [...] "from a part of whose being emanate a number of Shivas, Brahmas and Vishnus." [...] Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come to them many times tempting them with a boon, but Manu and Shatarupa do not stop their penance. They are finally satisfied only {{by the appearance of}} Rama, on whose left side is Sita, from a part of whom are born [...] "countless Lakshmis, Umas (Parvatis) and Brahmanis (Sarasvatis)." [...] In the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama in Balkand, the trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is present – Brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> own handiwork, while Vishnu is enchanted with Lakhmi on seeing Rama. In the Sundarkand, Hanuman tells Ravana that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva can create, preserve and destroy by the might of Rama. In the Lankakand, Tulsidas presents the universe as the cosmic form of Rama, in which Shiva is the consciousness, Brahma is the reason and Vishnu is his intelligence. As per Tulsidas, Rama is not only an avatar, but also the source of avatars – Krishna is also an Avatar of Rama. Thus, Tulsidas clearly considers Rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of Vishnu.|$|E
