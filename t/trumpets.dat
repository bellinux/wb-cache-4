5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and <b>trumpets.</b> Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood <b>trumpets.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three <b>trumpets</b> and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the <b>trumpets</b> add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E

5|$|The Meiningen cantatas of Johann Ludwig Bach {{were scored}} {{for the four}} vocal parts and {{a small group of}} instrumentalists, {{consisting}} of two oboes, violins, violas and continuo: at Meiningen, as with many of the smaller courts in Germany, resources were limited; it appears that continuo instruments like bassoons were available only when these works were performed elsewhere. When Bach performed his cousin's cantatas in Leipzig in 1726, he used the same orchestral forces as Meiningen for all but two, adding <b>trumpets</b> with drums in one and piccolo <b>trumpets</b> in another.|$|E

5|$|Unusually, {{the score}} omits oboes, English horns, bass clarinets, and <b>trumpets.</b> The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play {{only in the}} first movement, and {{only for a few}} bars (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).|$|E

40|$|The <b>trumpet</b> has {{undergone}} more design changes {{than any other}} instrument in history, and <b>trumpet</b> repertoire has changed along with the instrument's evolutionary design features. Tonal, chromatic, and dynamic range was expanded as technological advances were applied to the <b>trumpet.</b> As the design attributes of the <b>trumpet</b> changed through innovations and experimentation, new possibilities were opened up for composers and performers alike. Although some forms of the <b>trumpet</b> date back to antiquity (c. 1323 BC), this survey will start with the Renaissance, where a rise in humanism, city centers, art, and music and advances in metallurgy converge. I have chosen to perform works originally written for natural <b>trumpet,</b> cometto, keyed <b>trumpet,</b> comet, flugelhom, modem Bb <b>trumpet,</b> and modem C <b>trumpet</b> to illustrate {{the ways in which}} repertoire was influenced by different iterations of the <b>trumpet</b> along its evolutionary design path...|$|R
5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two <b>trumpets</b> {{are added to}} the original scoring. When possible Fauré employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist, partly because the soprano lines, particularly the solo in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.|$|E

5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver <b>trumpets</b> {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848.

They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own <b>trumpets</b> at state occasions.|$|E

40|$|The {{compositions}} of Fisher Aubrey Tull {{are widely}} performed {{and many have}} become standard repertoire. Tull's compositions encompass a multiplicity of performance media including works for orchestra, chorus, symphonic band, jazz band, brass choir, and solo and chamber works. Tull's compositional output for the <b>trumpet</b> is prolific and is acknowledged to be music of high quality. An examination of <b>Trumpet</b> and Brass Programs, compiled and published annually by the International <b>Trumpet</b> Guild, shows Tull's solo and ensemble works for <b>trumpet</b> to be frequently performed. Furthermore, his compositions for <b>trumpet</b> have been performed and recorded by internationally acclaimed artists including Vincent DiMartino, Terry Everson, Håkan Hardenberger, Anthony Plog, Carl "Doc" Severinsen and Allen Vizzutti. This study investigates Fisher Tull's eight solo works for <b>trumpet,</b> which include: Vignette for <b>Trumpet</b> and Piano (1954); Concerto No. 1 for <b>Trumpet</b> and Orchestra (1964); Concerto No. 2 for <b>Trumpet</b> and Band (1974); Three Bagatelles for <b>Trumpet</b> and Piano (1975); Eight Profiles for Solo <b>Trumpet</b> (1978); Rhapsody for <b>Trumpet</b> and Band (1980); Sonata for <b>Trumpet</b> and Piano (1986); and Chromutations for Solo <b>Trumpet</b> (1988). Histories of each composition are chronicled. An analysis of formal organization and significant style features examines musical structure, harmonic language, rhythmic character, instrumentation, and orchestration. A discussion of technical concerns specific to the <b>trumpet</b> that addresses range, tessitura, articulation, flexibility, endurance {{and the use of}} extended techniques is included. Performance suggestions, pertaining to technical and artistic issues, offer the reader specific recommendations as an aid in performance preparation. Finally, the significance of Fisher Tull's works for <b>trumpet</b> and his impact on the <b>trumpet</b> literature is assessed. Evidence suggests that his prolific compositional output, diversity of forms, and musical quality rank him {{as one of the most}} significant composers for the <b>trumpet</b> in the twentieth century...|$|R
