50|$|The {{total cost}} of {{producing}} a specific level of output {{is the cost of}} all the factors of input used. Conventionally, economists use models with two inputs: capital, K; and labor, L. Capital is assumed to be the fixed input, meaning that the amount of capital used does not vary with the level of production. The rental price per unit of capital is denoted r. Thus, the total fixed costs equal Kr. Labor is the variable input, meaning that the amount of labor used varies with the level of output. In fact, in the short run, the only way to vary output is by varying the amount of the variable input. Labor is denoted L and the per unit cost, or wage rate, is denoted w, so the <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> is Lw. Consequently, total cost is fixed costs (FC) plus variable cost (VC), or TC = FC + VC = Kr +wL.|$|E
50|$|Thus in {{determining}} whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> (VC) rather than total costs (FC (fixed costs) + VC). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost (R > VC) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs. (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant {{as it is a}} sunk cost. The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand if VC > R then the firm is not even covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent - if one divides both sides of inequality TR > VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P > AVC (price exceeds average variable cost)). If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization (or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the short}} run, a firm {{operating}} {{at a loss}} < TC (revenue less than total cost) or P < ATC (price less than unit cost) must decide whether to continue to operate or temporarily shutdown. The shutdown rule states [...] "{{in the short run}} a firm should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs." [...] Restated, the rule is that for a firm to continue producing in the short run it must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs. The rationale for the rule is straightforward. By shutting down a firm avoids all variable costs. However, the firm must still pay fixed costs. Because fixed cost must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shutdown.Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> (VC) rather than total costs (FC + VC). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its total variable cost (R > VC) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue ("contribution"), which can be applied to fixed costs. (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost. The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand, if VC > R then the firm is not even covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent (If you divide both sides of inequality TR > TVC by Q gives P > AVC). If the firm decides to operate, the firm will continue to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure not only profit maximization (loss minimization) but also maximum contribution.|$|E

40|$|Water {{conservation}} {{has become}} an increasingly important issue {{in much of the}} arid West and in California in particular. Governmental agencies are interested in instituting policies which will help conserve water (reduce water application levels on a per acre basis). Some of the policies include water pricing, tax credits and/or subsidies for improving field and irrigation delivery efficiencies, reductions in available irrigation water and use of the extension service as a means of conveying water-saving techniques and technologies to farmers. The effects of the above policies on farmer profits, returns over <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> and quantities of water conserved are examined for three crops grown in California - corn, cotton, and processing tomatoes. The results show that there is potential for conserving water in California through implementation of governmental policies. Water pricing policies could be effective on all crops if the price changes are dramatic rather than marginal. Improvements in field and delivery efficiencies for furrow irrigated crops could conserve water and improve farmers' returns over <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs.</b> Improving field efficiencies for sprinkler irrigated crops could conserve some water, but farmers returns over <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> are only marginally improved.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to compare the cost, monetary genetic gain and economic efficiency of classic selection and GS schemes in the meat sheep industry. Deterministic methods were used to model selection based on multi-trait indices from a sheep meat breeding program. Decisional variables related to male selection candidates and progeny testing were optimized to maximize the annual monetary genetic gain (AMGG), that is, a weighted sum of meat and maternal traits annual genetic gains. For GS, a reference population of 2000 individuals was assumed and genomic information was available for evaluation of male candidates only. In the classic selection scheme, males breeding values were estimated from own and offspring phenotypes. In GS, different scenarios were considered, differing by the information used to select males (genomic only, genomic+own performance, genomic+offspring phenotypes). The results showed that all GS scenarios were associated with higher <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> than classic selection (if the cost of genotyping was 123 euros/animal). In terms of AMGG and economic returns, GS scenarios were found to be superior to classic selection only if genomic information was combined with their own meat phenotypes (GS-Pheno) or with their progeny test information. The predicted economic efficiency, defined as returns (proportional to number of expressions of AMGG in the nucleus and commercial flocks) minus <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs,</b> showed that the best GS scenario (GS-Pheno) was up to 15 % more efficient than classic selection.

40|$|We assess {{size and}} scope-related {{economies in the}} global {{advertising}} and marketing services business. A translog cost function is employed wherein a firmâ€™s costs vary according to its scale and two dimensions {{of the scope of}} its operations. One dimension of firm scope relates to how its output is distributed across the global markets it serves (domestic vs. overseas) and the other to how its output is distributed across the line of services it offers (advertising-related vs. other marketing services). Parameters of the model are estimated via three stage least squares using annual data (1989 - 2001) for an unbalanced panel consisting of the eight largest holding companies in this industry. A firmâ€™s <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> are affected by its scale, scope (mix of services and markets served), and by the interaction of the two dimensions of scope. The latter effect suggests that cost economies may accompany the dual diversification strategy of jointly offering advertising and marketing services globally. Estimates indicate that the industryâ€™s long-run cost function is subject to very slight economies of scale, i. e., <b>total</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> increase less than proportionally as outputs increase. Consistent with the presence of modest global scale economies, product-specific diseconomies of scale accompany growth in volume obtained by extending either breadth of service offerings or market coverage. Scope economies arise when cost savings can be realized by a single firm jointly producing several services or jointly serving multiple markets as compared to splitting up the firm into smaller, stand-alone entities, each one producing just one service or serving a single market. A small cost advantage, typically of approximately two percent, is uniformly associated with joint production of services for both the domestic and overseas markets. Cost savings of a similar magnitude arise consistently from the joint production of advertising as well as other marketing services.
