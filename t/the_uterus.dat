5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E

30|$|Patients with {{at least}} one early {{miscarriage}} and a uterine septum were admitted for hysteroscopic metroplasty. Patients were allocated into 2 different study groups. According to the length of the uterine septum we differentiate <b>the</b> “subseptate <b>uterus</b> group” with an indentation of minimal 1, 5  cm but no complete septum and <b>the</b> “arcuate <b>uterus</b> group” with an indentation of less than 1, 5  cm. The main outcome parameter studied was the miscarriage rate at the first postoperative spontaneous pregnancy. Secondary outcome parameter was the comparison of time to conception before and after surgery and the final pregnancy outcome. 96 patients were included in the study 72 patients were included in <b>the</b> subseptate <b>uterus</b> group and 24 in <b>the</b> arcuate <b>uterus</b> group. <b>The</b> miscarriage rate after surgery was the same in both groups with 15.8 % in <b>the</b> subseptate <b>uterus</b> group vs. 16.7 % in <b>the</b> arcuate <b>uterus</b> group. This was significantly lower than the miscarriage rate before surgery in both groups, 84.3 % in <b>the</b> subseptate <b>uterus</b> group and of 97, 4 % in <b>the</b> arcuate <b>uterus</b> group. Furthermore both in the subseptate as the arcuate group the mean time to conceive spontaneously was significantly shorter after the surgery and no difference was seen between the 2 groups for the final pregnancy outcome.|$|R
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} the upper part of <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E
5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes.

It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
40|$|Estrogen {{is known}} to {{increase}} progesterone receptor (PR) levels in <b>the</b> wild-type mouse <b>uterus,</b> and this estrogen induction {{was thought to be}} important for progesterone action through the PR. The estrogen receptor α knockout (ERKO) mouse uterus was observed to express PR mRNA that cannot be induced by estrogen. Progesterone action was characterized to determine whether it was diminished in ERKO mice. The PR protein is present in <b>the</b> ERKO <b>uterus</b> at 60 % of the level measured in a wild-type <b>uterus.</b> <b>The</b> PR-A and PR-B isoforms are both detected on Western blot, and the ratio of isoforms is the same in both genotypes. Although the level of PR is reduced in <b>the</b> ERKO <b>uterus,</b> <b>the</b> receptor level is sufficient to induce genomic responses, since both calcitonin and amphiregulin mRNAs were increased after progesterone treatment. Finally, <b>the</b> ERKO <b>uterus</b> can be induced to undergo a progesterone-dependent decidual response. Surprisingly, the decidual response is estrogen independent in the ERKO, although it remains estrogen dependent in a wild type. These results indicate that estrogen receptor α modulation of PR levels is not necessary for expression of the PR or genomic and physiologic responses to progesterone in <b>the</b> ERKO <b>uterus...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> arcuate <b>uterus</b> {{is a form}} of a uterine anomaly or {{variation}} {{where the}} uterine cavity displays a concave contour towards the fundus.

5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|The leading {{treatment}} {{option for}} endometrial cancer is abdominal hysterectomy (the total removal by surgery of <b>the</b> <b>uterus),</b> together with {{removal of the}} fallopian tubes and ovaries on both sides, called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In more advanced cases, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended. If the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, the outcome is favorable, and the overall five-year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80%.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is the removal of <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery {{can be used as}} part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> via the abdomen is recommended over removal of <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> which causes scarring and infertility.
