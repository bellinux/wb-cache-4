40|$|Abstract. The paper aims {{to conduct}} a study of glass design in the decoration, {{emphasizing}} the work done by Dale Chihuly.

50|$|The Dacca State Railway {{opened the}} 144 km long metre gauge railway from Narayanganj to Mymensingh via Dhaka in 1884-1885. This line was meant {{primarily}} for the collection of jute and its onward dispatch to Kolkata, then known as Calcutta. It was also used by passengers to and from Kolkata, making way from Narayanganj and vice versa to Goalundo Ghat which was connected to Kolkata by rail in 1871. The launch from Goalundo Ghat to Narayanganj, across the Padma, <b>traversed</b> the <b>course</b> in about seven hours.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{is known}} that Field-of-view {{restrictions}} affect distance estimation, postural equilibrium, {{and the ability to}} control heading. These are all important factors when manoeuvring on foot through complex structured environments. Although considerable research has been devoted to the horizontal angular extent of the Field-of-View (FoV), rather less {{attention has been paid to}} the vertical angle. The present study investigated the effects of both vertical and horizontal FoV restriction on manoeuvring performance and head movement while <b>traversing</b> an obstacle <b>course</b> consisting of three different types of obstacles. A restriction of both the horizontal and vertical angle of the visual field resulted in increased time needed to <b>traverse</b> the <b>course.</b> In addition, the extent of head movement during traversal was affected by vertical, but not horizontal viewing restriction. Furthermore, it was investigated if performance could be improved by altering the orientation of the visual field instead of its dimensions. The results do not indicate this. The findings of this study can be used to formulate requirements for the selection and development of field-of-view limiting devices, such as head-mounted displays and night-vision goggles...|$|R
50|$|The Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits {{were the}} first missionaries of the Congo. Their labours were trying, and rather fruitless. In the seventeenth century, the Jesuits had two colleges, one at Loanda, another, of minor importance, at San Salvador. On the whole, Christianity never took firm root, and was early brought into {{discredit}} by the slave-trading Portuguese. While the Portuguese always confined themselves to the Lower Congo, {{as early as the}} seventeenth century the missionaries had <b>traversed</b> the <b>course</b> of the Zaire, and a seventeenth-century map has been discovered which traces the river according to data supplied by them.|$|R

25|$|In 1837 the Hippodrome racecourse {{was laid}} out. The racecourse {{ran around the}} hill, and {{bystanders}} were expected to watch from {{the summit of the}} hill. However, the venture was not a success, in part due to a public right of way which <b>traversed</b> the <b>course,</b> and in part due to the heavy clay of the neighbourhood which caused it to become waterlogged. The Hippodrome closed in 1841, after which development resumed and houses were built on the site. The crescent-shaped roads that circumvent the hill, such as Blenheim Crescent, Elgin Crescent, Stanley Crescent, Cornwall Crescent and Landsdowne Crescent, were built over the circular racecourse tracks. At the summit of hill stands the elegant St John's church, built in 1845 in the early English style, and which formed the centrepiece of the Ladbroke Estate development.|$|R
5000|$|An arcade sequel titled Marble Man: Marble Madness II {{was planned}} for release in 1991, though Cerny was uninvolved in the development. Development {{was led by}} Bob Flanagan who {{designed}} the game {{based on what he}} felt made Marble Madness a success in the home console market. Because the market's demographic was a younger audience, Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced [...] "Marble Man", which expanded upon the gameplay of the original game. The design also included pinball mini-games between sets of levels and allowed up to three players to <b>traverse</b> isometric <b>courses.</b> Its final wave is called [...] "King of the Mountain". Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and, with the help of Mike Hally, developed seventeen courses.|$|R
