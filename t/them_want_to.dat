5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served.

If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of <b>them,</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making <b>them</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made <b>them</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of <b>them</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E

In the first episode, the sight of women in lingerie made him physically ill due to (or despite) the fact that Brian had pasted his face on {{all the women in}} the catalogue. Steve enjoys playing Halo 2 online. He is often assaulted by strangers, who claim that his face just makes <b>them</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> punch him. Steve is also known for having noxious, unbearable flatulence, which is noted in several episodes, particularly in the episode [...] "Not Without My Daughter", in which he sets off a SWAT team evacuation and is interrogated by the NSA after telling Brian over the phone that he has [...] "left a bomb" [...] in Jay's police car.

2500|$|One character, a slave {{companion}} for the Sith Warrior named Vette, drew controversy. Writing for Kotaku, Mike Fahey, {{after playing}} the game, recalled players boasting of their torturing of Vette and her low affection rating for them. The Daily Mail ran {{an article about}} Fahey's story on their Mail Online website, remarking on how the option to treat Vette decently did not seem popular, and while noting Star Wars was [...] "no stranger to slavery" [...] said [...] "the idea of playing 'master' yourself is unsavoury". The Mail was criticised for its lack of evidence for its statements and its selective information. Forbes's Erik Kain criticised gaming as overly focused on [...] "teenage boys", calling {{the inclusion of a}} shock-collar-wearing slave [...] "not so much surprising as it is disappointing" [...] and [...] "really creepy". Kain commented how it enforced how gaming could be a [...] "hostile environment" [...] for girls and felt that the inclusion of choice failed to make the situation better. The Mary Sue contributor Becky Chambers felt Vette's inclusion was less [...] "sexist" [...] than [...] "shortsighted". Religion Dispatches researched the matter, surveying 369 players to ask them how they acted. The survey's findings suggested that most players chose the good options and felt uncomfortable doing any evil ones.
