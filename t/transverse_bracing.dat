2500|$|The T.II was a {{cantilever}} {{low wing}} monoplane with straight tapered, square tipped wings. Overhung ailerons were used.

2500|$|The Dyott was a single-seat, mid-wing {{monoplane}} {{of clean}} appearance for its day. [...] The fuselage was built up around four longerons. [...] These were of ash in the stressed region from wing spars to engine, spruce {{at the rear}} and internally wire braced. [...] Stringers behind the cockpit formed a smooth rounded decking under the overall fabric covering. The forward fuselage, including the cockpit was aluminium clad, with a neat nose piece over the 7-cylinder, 50hp (37kW) Gnome rotary engine, more to protect the pilot from oil than for streamlining. Steel tubing was used in several places: the empennage was steel framed, as was [...] the pilot's seat, and steel tubes formed the vertical undercarriage members. [...] There were four of the latter, each pair mounting a short wooden skid with steel cross bracing and a single axle on shock absorbers carrying a pair of wheels. [...] The undercarriage was initially completed with a long sprung tail skid, later replaced by a shorter cane skid mounted further aft. At the same time, Dyott made some changes to the <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing</b> of the main undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} bracing also bears some {{similarity to}} the mandolin. Gibson's mandocellos were typically constructed {{with a single}} <b>transverse</b> <b>brace</b> on the top just below the oval soundhole. Modern builders also use X-bracing.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifting frame}} was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with tubular and box <b>transverse</b> <b>braces.</b> The lifting frame was fitted with plumbing for fuelling the rocket; wiring for powering and monitoring the rocket and for field telephones; accommodations for carrying and dismounting the rocket; and folding platforms {{to service the}} rocket with rungs to access them.|$|R
25|$|Converting the {{assembled}} barges into landing craft involved cutting {{an opening in}} the bow for off-loading troops and vehicles, welding longitudinal I-beams and <b>transverse</b> <b>braces</b> to the hull to improve seaworthiness, adding a wooden internal ramp and pouring a concrete floor in the hold to allow for tank transport. As modified, the Type A1 barge could accommodate three medium tanks while the Type A2 could carry four.|$|R
2500|$|While in Hawaii, Blake became {{fascinated by}} the {{traditional}} surfboards preserved at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu. These included a variety of styles, from the shorter alaia to the heavy, 16-foot long olo boards traditionally reserved for royalty. On his 1926 visit, {{he was able to}} secure permission from the curators to study the boards' construction and restore several of them. He then began his own experiments in improving surfboard design. Up until that point, most modern surfers, even Duke Kahanamoku, used the shorter alaia boards due to the immense weight— up to 200 pounds— [...] of the solid olo boards. Blake initially sought to build lighter olos by drilling hundreds of holes in the board, then covering the openings with a thin outer layer. This was the style of board he used to win the 1928 Pacific Coast Championship. Then after three years of experimenting, in 1929, Blake constructed a hollow board with <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing.</b> [...] In 1931, he received a patent for his hollow surfboard design [...] "and opened the sport up to hundreds of people who weren't able to muscle the heavy plank boards down the beach and into the water." ...|$|E

50|$|Like all Junkers duralumin-structured designs, {{from the}} 1918 J 7 to the 1932 Ju 46, (some 35 models), it used an {{aluminium}} alloy (duralumin) structure entirely covered with Junkers' characteristic corrugated and stressed duralumin skin. Internally, the wing was built up on nine circular cross-section duralumin spars with <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing.</b> All control surfaces were horn balanced.|$|E
25|$|Exercises {{that are}} used to enhance back {{strength}} may also be used to prevent back injuries. Back exercises include the prone press-ups, upper back extension, <b>transverse</b> abdominus <b>bracing,</b> and floor bridges. If pain is present in the back, it can mean that the stabilization muscles of the back are weak and a person needs to train the trunk musculature. Other preventative measures are to lose weight and to not work oneself past fatigue. Signs of fatigue include shaking, poor coordination, muscle burning and loss of the <b>transverse</b> abdominal <b>brace.</b> Heavy lifting should be done with the legs performing the work, and not the back.|$|R
5000|$|Octave {{mandolin}} {{construction is}} similar to the mandolin: the body may be constructed with a bowl-shaped back according to designs of the 18th-century Vinaccia school, or with a flat (arched) back according to the designs of Gibson Guitar Corporation popularized in the United States in the early 20th Century. The scale of the octave mandolin is longer than that of the mandolin, and varies more widely, from 19" [...] (48.4cm) to 24" [...] (61.0cm), with 21" [...] (53.3cm) being typical. The internal bracing {{is similar to}} the mandolin and mandola, with a single <b>transverse</b> <b>brace</b> on the top just below the oval soundhole. On modern instruments X-bracing is sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 21st century, understrength girders and {{corrosion}} {{had led to}} the line speed over the bridge being reduced to 60 mph for passenger trains, down to only 10 mph for trains with a route availability of 9 or more. In 2009, a modernisation program began - Clancy Docwra installed services (telecoms, fresh and waste water, electricity, signalling) to the central pier through piping under the river bed. Carillion was appointed main contractor in March 2010. The bridge steelwork was repaired and upgraded over a six-week line closure starting in October 2010 - over 400 tonnes of steelwork was installed including diagonal <b>transverse</b> <b>braces,</b> and stiffening to the girders of the web. Additional work included track renewal and painting of the bridge. The {{total cost of the}} project was £6 million; the firm of Pell Frischmann was the designing engineer.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the decking was {{strengthened}} {{by adding a}} reinforced concrete slab. In 1990, tests showed the bridge was too weak for many heavy goods vehicles, and traffic was limited to a 7.5 ton maximum. This was increased to 17 tons after the bridge had been strengthened in 1992. The secondary members needed strengthening and this was effected by enhancing the shear strength of the transverse cross beams by bonding steel plates to the web of the cross beams. The longitudinal cross-bracing was {{strengthened by}} using angle splints and {{the space between the}} splints and the cross-bracing was grouted. Additional <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing</b> was supplied by reinforcing the central spine of the arch, with one end bolted to steel sleeves, and the other end bolted to the cross beams {{at the top of the}} arch.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this Master´s thesis is to design and assess the load Bering steel {{structure}} of the hippodrome in Napajedla. The hippodrome is solved as a hall object in two alternatives. Both alternatives are elliptical in shape with dimensions of 40 and 80 m. Load bearing structure of the chosen alternative is formed by transversely oriented column binding with the axial spacing of 6, 0 m. Transversely oriented binding is formed from spatial lattice truss supported by fixed solid columns. The spatial rigidity of the structure is ensured by fixing columns in the transverse direction and by using <b>transverse</b> <b>braces</b> in the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal braces help to ensure the spatial rigidity. The work consists of the design and assessment of the main load bearing components, the solution of chosen details of joints and columns´ anchoring, solution of construction component and the elaboration of statement of material and drawings´ documentation...|$|R
50|$|The SVA was a {{conventionally}} laid-out unequal-span biplane - however, it {{was unusual}} in featuring Warren Truss-style struts joining its two wings, and therefore having no <b>transverse</b> (spanwise) <b>bracing</b> wires.

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is actually}} a hull, which makes use of a semi-monocoque light alloy construction; according to aerospace publication Flight International, the hull design was [...] "reminiscent of flying-boat engineering". The main cabin lacks any <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing,</b> except for a single bulkhead between the cockpit and cabin. Substantial built-up frames connect the strengthened roof structure with the floor/planing-bottom of transverse under-floor bulkheads and outer skin. A conventional exterior skin is used, employing longitudinal stiffeners {{as well as two}} lines of deep channel members, while the under-floor cross members are reinforced with vertical stiffeners. There is no keel, at the floor level there are horizontal members between frames which are stiffened by transverse shear angles. Flexible fuel cells are stored in four watertight under-floor compartments lying fore and aft of the rotor axis, while the floor itself is fitted with removable panels. A hatch set into the floor, positioned approximately underneath the rotor axis, is used for sling-load operations.|$|E

50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided transverse frames, all but the rear three and front two frames made up of kingpost-braced girders. These were spaced 10 m (32 ft 9 in) apart, with an intermediate frame in the middle of each bay, and were attached to a triangular section ventral keel, the apex of which was braced {{to the ends of the}} outer ends of the lower transverse frame girders on each side. The transverse frames were connected by 13 principal longitudinal girders, of which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary longitudinal girders between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing</b> of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag. This feature was the subject of a Schütte Lanz patent, and had not previously been used by Zeppelin.|$|E

Comparison between the analytical results and the FEM calculated results shows that the analytical solution {{presented in this paper}} is sufficiently accurate. The parametric analysis results show that the lateral buckling critical load of the arch bridge with fixed boundary conditions is about 1. 14 to 1. 16 times as large as that of the arch bridge with hinged boundary condition. The lateral buckling critical load increases by approximately 31. 5 % to 41. 2 % when stable arch ribs are added, and the critical load increases as the inclined angle of stable arch rib increases. The differences in the center angles of the main arch rib and the stable arch rib have little effect on the lateral buckling critical load...|$|R
5000|$|The tops of most {{steel string}} {{acoustic}} guitars are braced using the X-brace system, or {{a variation of}} the X-brace system, generally attributed to Christian Frederick Martin between 1840 and 1845 for use in gut string guitars.The system consists of two braces forming an [...] "X" [...] shape across the soundboard below the top of the sound hole. The lower arms of the [...] "X" [...] straddle and support the ends of the bridge. Under the bridge is a hardwood bridge plate which prevents the ball end of the strings from damaging the underside of the soundboard. Below the bridge patch are one or more tone bars which support the bottom of the soundboard. These abut one of the X braces and usually slant down towards the bottom edge of the soundboard. The top tone bar butts against a portion of the bridge patch in most instruments. Above the sound hole a large <b>transverse</b> <b>brace</b> spans the width of the upper bout of the soundboard. Around the lower bout, small finger braces support the area between the X-braces and the edge of the soundboard.|$|R

40|$|The work {{deals with}} the {{structural}} analysis of an historic masonry building, Palazzo del Capitano in Mantua, subject to significant static instabilities due to an overturning of the longitudinal façades, probably related to ground settlements. The exact geometry of the structure is acquired {{by means of the}} laser scanning technique and thanks to previous investigations, the main mechanical properties of the materials are reasonably well defined. Based on these information a three-dimensional finite element model of the entire structure is implemented, taking into consideration all the geometrical (contact between not connected panels and large displacement effects) and material (elasto plastic damage behavior of the masonry) nonlinearities, in order to investigate the seismic behavior of the structure by means of nonlinear dynamic analysis. The outcome of the analysis points out that the longitudinal façade, overlooking Piazza Sordello, is poorly constrained both to the floors and to the <b>transverse</b> <b>bracing</b> elements, therefore not able to counteract its deformation when a seismic event occurs.

Three pairs of longitudinal, two transverse and numerous radial muscles ensure shape and flexibility of the prostomium. Mobility of the sub-biramous parapodia and their chaetae is achieved by seven different muscle types. The body wall contains <b>transverse</b> and <b>bracing</b> muscles and in total five longitudinal muscle strands: two dorsolateral, two ventral and one ventromedial. Numerous transverse fibres extend from the dorsal side peripherally and ventrally and become concentrated into six or seven pairs of bundles per segment on the ventral side.
