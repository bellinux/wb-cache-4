He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with several}} actresses reprising their characters, [...] "Sex Ed" [...] {{also saw the}} {{introduction}} of Nate, played by Mark Proksch; he {{would go on to}} feature in this season, as well as the following two. [...] "Sex Ed" [...] was viewed by 7.36 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, marking a slight increase in the ratings when compared to the previous week. The episode was also the highest-ranked NBC series of the night, but it received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom felt that Michael was characterized as <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> and that Andy's subplot was not compelling.|$|E

[...] Although his teachers [...] "not unfrequently turned me off {{with little or no}} attention, as though I was <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> to learn and too dull to feel neglect," [...] Strang recalled that he spent [...] "long weary days... upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking... my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears."

500|$|The name Valérian {{comes from}} Eastern Europe, {{although}} its origin is Latin, from valere ("to be strong"). Valérian {{was created by}} Mézières and Christin {{as a reaction to}} the fearless boy-scout (e.g. The Adventures of Tintin) and American superhero characters that were prevalent in comics available in France at the time. Instead they sought to devise a [...] "banal character" [...] with [...] "no extraordinary means of action". [...] Eventually, with Christin feeling that they had gone too far with this angle and that the Valérian character had become <b>too</b> <b>stupid,</b> from The Ghosts of Inverloch (Les Spectres d'Inverloch) onwards, Valérian was made more sympathetic and given a greater piece of the action.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and felt that}} Michael's antics—largely {{the fact that he}} easily {{believes}} he has herpes—were <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> to be believable; however, he felt that the episode's main story largely worked as planned. However, McNutt panned the episode's secondary story focusing on Andy, noting that it [...] "lazily tapped into the series' basic structure". He ultimately concluded that [...] "without any particularly strong jokes, it fell entirely on Andy's character, and there just wasn't enough there to support it". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that, while Michael's story [...] "had its moments", it was largely [...] "creepy and uncomfortable". He also criticized Andy's characterization, noting that, in the episode, he was written extremely similar to Michael.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, saying, [...] "A fun episode, where you root for Bart and, unusually, Nelson - all the way through. Homer is just <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> for words, but that's excusable because we finally see Ned Flanders lose it, big time!" [...] In 2011, Keith Plocek of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog named the scene in which Homer tries to purchase [...] "beer that has candy floating in it" [...] (which Homer calls skittlebrau) at the Kwik-E-Mart as the fourth best food moment on the show.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the [...] "X-File in itself is an interesting concept, but left frustratingly vague." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did positively write that the episode is [...] "a character study which gives its new leads some background and depth and, better yet, somewhere new to develop." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "there {{are a lot of}} things to like in “Empedocles,” but the central conceit is just <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> for the episode as a whole to work." [...] While he enjoyed the [...] "way that [...] features all four FBI agents in the same episode", he was critical of both the plot and the Mulder and Scully dynamic, noting that it fell flat.|$|E
500|$|At home, Patrick is {{typically}} depicted either sleeping, watching TV, or {{engaged in the}} [...] "art of doing nothing", at which he is an expert. All the furnishings in the space under his rock are made of sand, and Patrick can simply opt to quickly build up furniture as needed; even so, his living space is sparse and contains only the barest essentials. Aside from his best friend SpongeBob, who is often impressed by Patrick's capacity {{to come up with}} naïve yet genius plans or solutions, Patrick frequently irritates those around him and is confounded by the simplest of questions or subjects. The characters of Mr. Krabs and Squidward have no patience for Patrick's stupidity, and the former does not pay him much regard; Clancy Brown, who provides Mr. Krabs' voice, said, [...] "The only person that he [...] doesn't hire is Patrick because Patrick is just <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> to work for nothing." [...] Sandy often gets annoyed by Patrick, but still sees him as a friend.|$|E
500|$|Claudius was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus on 24 October, 54 AD, {{ten days}} after his death. Despite the great {{political}} tumult Claudius' passing caused, Nero and the Senate very quickly deified Claudius and Nero took the throne, just as Agrippina had wanted. at the young age of sixteen. The usurpation was politically easy for Nero; Claudius' will had specified that either Nero or Britannicus should take the throne following his death. Nero swiftly took firm control over an unsettled public; all but Claudius' most rigid and unmoving supporters became Nero's men after only a short period. This can be at least partially attributed to Nero's very well known opinions of Claudius, who was his adoptive father; Nero often politically and publicly criticised and even insulted the late Claudius and many Claudian laws and policies were disregarded and abandoned under Nero's reasoning that Claudius was simply <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> and senile to be given any consideration. Nero responded to allegations of poisoned mushrooms being used to kill Claudius, by naming the fungus [...] "the food of the gods", lending further credence {{to the idea that}} mushrooms were used.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} at Saint Hilda's Primary School, Presbyterian High School and other {{locations}} during the school holidays in June. Neo hired real gangsters to act in several gangster scenes as he was dissatisfied with the extras. According to him, communicating with the gangsters was difficult, but {{when he decided to}} apply the lessons from the movie and praised them for a good take, they reacted well. Several members of the cast also said that I Not <b>Stupid</b> <b>Too</b> inspired them to communicate better with their family members. On 26 January 2006, distributor United International Pictures released I Not <b>Stupid</b> <b>Too</b> on 36 screens in Singapore.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the funniest}} and the stupidest movie I've ever seen because <b>too</b> many <b>stupid</b> things {{happened}} in it.

500|$|Friday saw {{yet more}} {{witnesses}} for the prosecution, {{bringing the total}} brought by Davy to about 60. [...] The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. [...] Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish {{whether or not she}} could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. [...] On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. [...] One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing [...] "a little". [...] This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. [...] Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. [...] Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her [...] "deplorable condition". [...] Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. [...] The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a [...] "poor, miserable wretch" [...] at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and <b>too</b> <b>stupid</b> to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
