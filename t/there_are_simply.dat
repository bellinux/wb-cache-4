25|$|Some {{observers}} such as British daily The Guardian and CNNs Richard Quest, {{as well as}} {{the city}} administration itself, has linked the issue of cyclist behavior to the city's novel problem of bike congestion; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> too many bicycles, relative to the infrastructure provided. During the morning and afternoon rush hour, it is not uncommon that there are too many cyclists for all to cross during green light cycles at intersections along the busy corridors. Another rush hour issue is lack of space on busy sections of the bicycle path network, with cyclists moving at different speeds without much leeway, creating an intimidating atmosphere for kids, the elderly and inexperienced cyclists. This in turn has created a conflict of space allocation, where cycling advocates claim that too little is done to accommodate the majority of cyclists and pedestrians since only 29.1% of the city's population own a car, while some motorists, including the Danish motoring association, feels that the capital hate cars, and that the city's accommodation of bicycles have already gone too far.|$|E

25|$|Bedouin {{women face}} {{many of the}} same {{problems}} in terms of accessing health care as do Bedouin men in the Negev. To begin with, infrastructure in Bedouin towns is often underdeveloped or non-existent. In addition to restricting access to health care, this has the potential to create its own health problems, especially in the unrecognized villages. For example, in many unrecognized townships, the absence of a waste disposal system means that trash is deposited into a large, open-air pit. This can cause a myriad of health problems stemming from improper sanitation. Moreover, Bedouins often face both a cultural and a language barrier when seeking medical attention. A relative dearth of Arabic-speaking doctors (and even fewer Arabic-speaking specialists) means that medical attention is often given in Hebrew. Not all Negev Bedouin speak Hebrew, and those that do speak it as a second language. This is especially problematic for those requiring more specialized or intensive care, which often requires strict adherence to certain guidelines. When those guidelines are not fully understood, further health complications can arise. Finally, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> not enough doctors to fully serve the needs of the Bedouin population. In the seven recognized Bedouin towns in the Negev, there are a total of seven private pharmacies and 27 family health clinics operated by the Ministry of Health. In 2009, the total population of these towns was near 120,000.|$|E

2500|$|Virtual reality therapy (VRT) uses {{specially}} programmed computers, {{visual immersion}} devices and artificially created environments {{to give the}} patient a simulated experience {{that can be used}} to diagnose and treat psychological conditions that cause difficulties for patients. In many environmental phobias, reaction to the perceived hazards, such as heights, speaking in public, flying, close spaces, are usually triggered by visual and auditory stimuli. In VR-based therapies, the virtual world is a means of providing artificial, controlled stimuli in the context of treatment, and with a therapist able to monitor the patient's reaction. Unlike traditional cognitive behavior therapy, VR-based treatment may involve adjusting the virtual environment, such as for example adding controlled intensity smells or adding and adjusting vibrations, and allow the clinician to determine the triggers and triggering levels for each patient's reaction. VR-based therapy systems may allow replaying virtual scenes, with or without adjustment, to habituate the patient to such environments. Therapists who apply virtual reality exposure therapy, just as those who apply in-vivo exposure therapy, can take one of two approaches concerning the intensity of exposure. The first approach is called flooding, which refers to the most intense approach where stimuli that produce the most anxiety are presented first. For soldiers who have developed PTSD from combat, this could mean first exposing them to a virtual reality scene of their fellow troops being shot or injured followed by less stressful stimuli such as only the sounds of war. On the other hand, what is referred to as graded-exposure takes a more relaxed approach in which the least distressing stimuli are introduced first. VR-exposure, as compared to in-vivo exposure has the advantage of providing the patient a vivid experience, without the associated risks or costs. VRT has great promise since it historically produces a [...] "cure" [...] about 90% of the time at about half the cost of traditional cognitive behavior therapy authority, and is especially promising as a treatment for PTSD where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> not enough psychologists and psychiatrists to treat all the veterans with anxiety disorders diagnosed as related to their military service.|$|E
