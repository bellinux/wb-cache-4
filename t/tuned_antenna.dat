In addition, if the power is very low, the analyzer can be used outside of the frequency bands licensed to the transmitter operator and thus get data on the antenna performance over a range of frequencies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} need for {{fundamental}} universally valid definitions of exact bandwidth and quality factor () of tuned antennas, as well as {{the need for}} efficient accurate approximate formulas for computing this bandwidth and, exact and approximate expressions are found for the bandwidth and of a general single-feed (one-port) lossy or lossless linear antenna tuned to resonance or antiresonance. The approximate expression derived for the exact bandwidth of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> differs from previous approximate expressions in that it is inversely proportional to the magnitude 0 (0) of the frequency derivative of the input impedance and, for not too large a bandwidth, it is nearly equal to the exact bandwidth of the <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> at every frequency 0, that is, throughout antiresonant as well as resonant frequency bands. It is also shown that an appropriately defined exact of a tuned lossy or lossless antenna is approximately proportional to 0 (0) and thus this is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth (for not too large a bandwidth) of a simply <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> at all frequencies. The exact of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> is defined in terms of average internal energies that emerge naturally from Maxwell’s equations applied to the <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna.</b> These internal energies, which are similar but not identical to previously defined quality-factor energies, and the associated are proven to increase without bound as the size of an antenna is decreased. Numerical solutions to thin straight-wire and wire-loop lossy and lossless antennas, as well as to a Yagi antenna and a straight-wire antenna embedded in a lossy dispersive dielectric, confirm the accuracy of the approximate expressions and the inverse relationship between the defined bandwidth and the defined over frequency ranges that cover several resonant and antiresonant frequency bands.

40|$|The mutual {{coupling}} effect between antenna elements on an array&# 39;s bandwidth is investigated using scattering parameters {{instead of the}} mutual impedance. First, an approximate expression is derived for matched voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) bandwidth of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna,</b> which reveals that the bandwidth is inversely proportional to the magnitude |&#x 0393; 0 &#x 0027;(&#x 03 C 9; 0) | of the frequency derivative of the reflection coefficient. Next, considering linear antenna arrays with corporate feed as an example, closed-form expressions of the reflection coefficient are derived at the input port of the feeding network, which shows that the active reflection coefficient of an array is the linear superposition of elements&# 39; passive reflection coefficient S 11 and the {{mutual coupling}} coefficient S 12 from adjacent elements. The VSWR bandwidth expressions for an array imply that bandwidth enhancement of the overall array can be achieved when the element passive reflection coefficient S 11 and mutual coupling S 12 are cancelled, {{as well as the}} frequency derivatives S 11 &#x 0027; and S 12 &#x 0027; also cancel each other.

The code has been tested by computing the current distribution on the central conductor and screen of simplified ICRH antennas in different cases: in vacuum [1] and {{in the presence of}} plasma [2], without or with magnetic shielding effects [3 - 5]. The unrealistic features (spurious modes such as screen modes), found when using the idealised infinite screen model, are removed by the consideration of a more realistic array of finite blade elements to describe the screen. The Q 1 antenna used in the Tore Supra tokamak has shown hot spots [6] and to better understand their origin, it is necessary to know the electric field structure in front of it.
