5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a {{harmless}} species has evolved <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> warning signals of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrument}} is equally famous in Turkey, especially the lower-pitched clarinet in G. The western European clarinet crossed via Turkey to Arabic music, {{where it is}} widely used in Arabic pop, especially if {{the intention of the}} arranger is <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Turkish style.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> <b>the</b> Septuagint and Homer's Odyssey, MacDonald {{proposes that}} Mark's Gospel and Luke-Acts used the following literary models: Homer's Iliad, several Homeric Hymns, Euripides' Bacchae and Madness of Heracles, and dialogues by Plato and Xenophon about Socrates.|$|R

5|$|Barbadian folk dances {{include a}} wide variety of styles, {{performed}} at Landship, holidays and other occasions. Dancers and other performers at the crop over festivals, for example, are popular and an iconic part of Barbadian culture, known for dancing in the costumes of sugarcane-cutters. The Landship movement features song and dance meant <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> passage of a British navy ship through rough seas; Landship and other occasions also feature African-derived improvised and complexly-rhythmic dances, and British hornpipes, jigs, maypole dances and Marches.|$|E
5|$|Carter's story draws {{heavily on}} Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and {{particularly}} on James Whale's 1931 {{film version of}} the story. The script had been written specifically with singer Cher and actress Roseanne Barr in mind, but both were unavailable {{at the time of}} shooting. Talk-show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself, and Chris Owens—who appeared in later episodes as FBI agent Jeffrey Spender—played The Great Mutato. The episode was filmed in black-and-white, with a sky backdrop created <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> style of old Frankenstein films. Owens wore makeup and prosthetics that took several hours to apply.|$|E
5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{dress of}} 18th-century Andalusia was {{strongly influenced by}} majismo {{within the context of}} casticismo (purism, traditionalism, authenticity). The archetype of the majo and maja was that of a bold, pure Spaniard from a lower-class background, somewhat flamboyant in his or her style of dress. This emulation of lower-class dress also extended <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> <b>the</b> clothes of brigands and Romani ("Gypsy") women.|$|R

5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had never left the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' mentality <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> customs {{from their}} Western European homelands meant {{that there were}} very few {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E

5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen {{communities}} have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them as an attempt <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting {{of the film}} are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
50|$|Indonesian {{pop music}} today is heavily {{influenced}} by trends and recordings from America, Britain, Japan, and Korea; however, in return the Indonesian style of pop music has influenced the regional pop culture in Southeast Asia, especially the Malaysian pop scene that began <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian style of pop music in late 2000s. Although influences ranging from American pop, British pop, and also Asian J-pop and K-pop are obvious, the Indonesian pop phenomenon is not completely derivative; it expresses the sentiments and styles of contemporary Indonesian life.|$|R

5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} {{statements about the}} nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on plant matter and animals both {{on land and}} in water. It eats prey such as beetles, millipedes, and slugs. Also, wood turtles consume {{specific}} fungi (Amanita muscaria and Leccinum arcolatum), mosses, grasses, various insects, and also carrion. On occasion, {{it can be seen}} stomping the ground with alternating hits of the left and right front feet. This behavior is thought <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> sound of falling rain, sometimes causing earthworms to rise to the surface where they quickly become easy prey. When hunting, the wood turtle pokes its head into such areas as dead and decaying logs, the bottoms of bushes, and in other vegetation. In the water, it exhibits similar behavior, searching algae beds and cavities along the sides of the stream or river.|$|E

5|$|The {{works are}} {{typically}} installed in listening booths with headphones, {{though they were}} also installed in the public streets of Cologne and Helsinki as a commentary on globalization. His Lagos by Bus is a recording of Lagos passengers traveling the danfo share taxis and molue minibuses characteristic {{of the city to}} work. A vendor offers a prayer before selling medication to riders, as a sociopolitical protest song by Fela Kuti plays on the radio. The 40-minute installation was exhibited at Cologne's Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum in 2010, and the booth was painted yellow with black stripes and stickers <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> hallmarks of the danfo. An outdoor installation at the Cologne Public Library piped the streets of Lagos to those of Cologne. A similar installation took place at Helsinki's Kiasma contemporary art museum.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{years as}} a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought <b>to</b> <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the embolon (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced the earlier hoplon-style shield, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either cuirass breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands, and armed with sarissa pikes and a dagger as a secondary weapon. The elite hypaspistai infantry, composed of handpicked men {{from the ranks of}} the pezhetairoi, were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes).|$|E
5000|$|As [...] comments, Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel {{related to}} his biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel how his father took {{pleasure}} in converting trios into quartets ex tempore ("aus dem Stegereif"): BWV 1044/2 is a prime example. Bach created a complex texture in this movement by juxtaposing the detached melody in the harpsichord with a parallel sustained melody in thirds or sixths in the violin or flute; and in contrast a further layer is added by the delicate pizzicato accompaniment in the fourth voice, —first in the violin and then echoed by the flute—which comes close <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> <b>the</b> timbre of the harpsichord.|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} we came back more cautiously, and we avoided the glowing coals. We fell <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> <b>the</b> Fire-Men. We squatted down by the fire, and with heads bent forward on our knees, made believe to sleep. Then we mimicked their speech, {{talking to each other}} in their fashion and making a great gibberish. I remembered seeing the wizened old hunter poke the fire with a stick. I poked the fire with a stick, turning up masses of live coals and clouds of white ashes. This was great sport, and soon we were coated white with the ashes.|$|R
60|$|For the rich, {{cremation}} {{would answer}} {{as well as}} burial; for the ceremonies connected with it could be made as costly and ostentatious as a Hindu suttee; while for the poor, cremation {{would be better than}} burial, because so cheap {footnote [Four or five dollars is the minimum cost.]}--so cheap until <b>the</b> poor got <b>to</b> <b>imitating</b> <b>the</b> rich, which they would do by-and-bye. The adoption of cremation would relieve us of a muck of threadbare burial-witticisms; but, on the other hand, it would resurrect a lot of mildewed old cremation-jokes that have had a rest for two thousand years.|$|R
