50|$|<b>Terconazole</b> {{synthesis}} synologous with ketoconazole {{except for}} the fact that triazole and not imidazole heterocyclic ring is used, and that isopropyl group instead of acetamide.Terconazole has the chemical formula C26H31Cl2N5O3. The chemical name for <b>terconazole</b> is 1-{(2S,4S)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-{p-(4-isopropyl-1-piperazinyl)phenoxymethyl}-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl}-1H-1,2,4-triazole. <b>Terconazole</b> has a melting point of 126.3 °C (259.34 °F). The molecular weight of <b>terconazole</b> is 532.462 g/mol. <b>Terconazole</b> is synthesized using two chemical compounds: cis-2(bromomethyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl methyl benzoate and the sodium salt of triazole, created by mixing triazole with sodium hydride. These are put in a solution and catalyzed using dimethyl sulfate at 1300 °C (2372 °F) to give many different types of triazole derivatives. These are purified using alcohol and chromatography. <b>Terconazole</b> is non-reactive except when exposed to strong oxidizing agents or strong bases due to the nitrogen attached to the triazole ring. It has been found to be photosensitive.|$|E
50|$|Absorption of <b>terconazole</b> is 5-8% in {{patients}} {{that have had}} a hysterectomy and 12-16% in other patients. In those that administered 0.8% <b>terconazole,</b> plasma concentrations of the drug remained quite low with the peak plasma concentration being 0.006 mcg at 6.6 hours. Those metabolism rates show similar results in pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis, non-pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis and healthy women. The half-life of <b>terconazole</b> in blood is recorded to be around 6.9 hours over a range of 4-11.3 hours). Radioactivity of plasma <b>terconazole</b> is low compared to <b>terconazole</b> at 0.6%. Excretion of radioactivity is via two routes, renal (32-53%) and fecal (47-52%). Metabolism is extensive and is highly protein bound (94.9%) with the degree of binding being independent of drug concentration.|$|E

50|$|In {{a review}} of 19 studies, it was shown that {{short-term}} rates for intravaginally administered azole treatments show mycological cure (no presence of organism) in 80% of cases in a short term follow-up and 66% over long term follow-up. In a double-blind study by Slavin in 1992, <b>terconazole</b> showed a 75% mycological cure over a short-term period (7-14 days) and 100% mycological cure over a long-term period (28-34 days). This study focused on the drug as an 80 mg vaginal suppository, taken three times overnight by 10 women. In another placebo-controlled, double blind study by Schmidt et al., the efficacy of different concentrations of <b>terconazole</b> creams were tested.

50|$|<b>Terconazole</b> is an {{antifungal}} drug used {{to treat}} vaginal yeast infection. It comes as a lotion or a suppository and disrupts the biosynthesis of fats in a yeast cell.

50|$|<b>Terconazole</b> binds to the heme iron {{component}} on the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol of fungi, {{also known}} as CYP3A4. The gene ERG11 controls lanosterol creation. Lanosterol is found within the yeast plasma membrane. It is a class of methylsterol. Within a normal yeast cell, lanosterol is demethylated using 14α-demethylation. This process creates zymosterol: a major constituent in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway {{for the creation of}} cell membrane constituents in yeast. This structure provides the membrane with fluidity. This occurs by transforming lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-β-ol. This stops respiration by prohibiting reduction of NADH to NAD. This stops biosynthesis of cell membrane products as well as transport and catabolism. Eventually, membrane fluidity and activity of membrane bound enzymes become depleted. It has also been shown to inhibit morphologic change of yeast as well as cell adherence and is directly toxic to yeast. <b>Terconazole</b> targets fungi specifically since humans do not use lanosterol in this pathway. This process does not affect all fungi such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which lacks lanosterol.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, {{the first}} {{commercial}} antifungal drug was available on the market. Before this, antifungal treatments were rare and expensive. This treatment was called amphotericin B. It was effective in its function but was very toxic and only used for serious infections. The drug was infused into the bloodstream and could cause kidney damage and other side effects. The first azole compounds were administered to humans under strict care. These compounds were imidazoles, a molecule containing two non-adjacent nitrogen atoms in a 5 membered ring. These were synthesized in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first oral antimycotic imidazole called ketoconazole was available {{on the market in}} 1981. Triazole based drugs came shortly after and quickly gained popularity due to its broader spectrum of antifungal activity and less toxicity. <b>Terconazole</b> was the first triazole-based antifungal drug synthesized for human use. Janssen Pharmaceutica developed it in 1983. Previously, all triazole based drugs targeted fungal infections related to plants from Candida species. Since creation, <b>terconazole</b> has been superseded by second-generation triazoles due to their even broader spectrum and higher activity levels against resistant pathogens like Aspergillus spp. It is still used as a treatment in cases of resistance to other drugs.|$|E

We sought to assess the clinical and mycological efficacy of <b>terconazole</b> cream in women with non-C. albicans vaginitis. Methods: The records of patients who had received a 7 -day course of <b>terconazole</b> cream for culture-proved non-C, albicans vaginitis were reviewed. Data with regard to patient demographics, clinical and mycologic response to therapy within 1 month of treatment, and outcome with other antifungal therapies were analyzed. Results: Twenty-eight patients received <b>terconazole</b> cream for non-C, albicans infections. Three patients did not return for follow-up. The median age was 45 years. Seven (28 %) patients were nulliparous. The median duration of symptoms was 3 years. Nine patients (36 %) had received <b>terconazole</b> within the 6 months prior to referral. Overall, there were 20 C. glabrata cases, 3 C. parapsilosis, and 2 C. lusitaniae. Fourteen (56 %) patients achieved a mycologic cure; 11 (44 %) noted a resolution of their symptoms.

40|$|The PASCO {{antifungal}} susceptibility test system, {{developed in}} collaboration with a commercial company, is a broth microdilution assay which is faster {{and easier to use}} than the reference broth microdilution test performed according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) document M 27 -A guidelines. Advantages of the PASCO system include the system's inclusion of quality-controlled, premade antifungal panels containing 10, twofold serial dilutions of drugs and a one-step inoculation system whereby all wells are simultaneously inoculated in a single step. For the prototype panel, we chose eight antifungal agents for in vitro testing (amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, and <b>terconazole)</b> and compared the results with those of the NCCLS method for testing 74 yeast isolates (14 Candida albicans, 10 Candida glabrata, 10 Candida tropicalis, 10 Candida krusei, 10 Candida dubliniensis, 10 Candida parapsilosis, and 10 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates). The overall agreements between the methods were 91 % for fluconazole, 89 % for amphotericin B and ketoconazole, 85 % for itraconazole, 80 % for flucytosine, 77 % for <b>terconazole,</b> 66 % for miconazole, and 53 % for clotrimazole. In contrast to the M 27 -A reference method, the PASCO method classified as resistant seven itraconazole-susceptible isolates (9 %), two fluconazole-susceptible isolates (3 %), and three flucytosine-susceptible isolates (4 %), representing 12 major errors. In addition, it classified two fluconazole-resistant isolates (3 %) and one flucytosine-resistant isolate (1 %) as susceptible, representing three very major errors. Overall, the agreement between the methods was {{greater than or equal to}} 80 % for four of the seven species tested (C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. neoformans).

40|$|The {{relative}} growth (percentage {{of growth}} relative to control growth) of 496 isolates representing six Candida species was assessed {{as a means}} of determining in vitro susceptibilities of the isolates in microdilution plate wells containing single concentrations of each of seven antifungal agents. The relative growth data were highly reproducible. With flucytosine and amorolfine they correlated well with MICs, but for an azole antifungal agent, <b>terconazole,</b> they did not correlate with MICs. Distributions of relative growth percentages for different Candida spp. showed significant differences in species susceptibility to individual agents. For example, C. albicans was less susceptible than the other species to amorolfine; C. parapsilosis isolates were particularly susceptible to terbinafine; and C. glabrata, C. guiliermondii, and C. krusei isolates were less susceptible than C. albicans to fluconazole and ketoconazole but equally susceptible as or more susceptible than C. albicans to itraconazole. Differential patterns of susceptibility to individual azole antifungal agents were noted for some individual strains as well as for Candida spp. Yeast susceptibility testing with imidazole- and triazole-derivative antifungal agents remains a controversial issue. While efforts to standardize tests with amphotericin B and flucytosine have led to MIC test protocols that give good interlaboratory reproducibility (25), the same is not yet true for imidazole and triazole compounds, for which most au-thors consider MIC tests to lack reliability because their outcome depends too heavily on variable experimental con-ditions such as medium composition, pH, temperature, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} growth (percentage {{of growth}} relative to control growth) of 767 Candida isolates representing five species {{was measured in}} microcultures at 25 and 37 degrees C.

Repetition of the experiments at four different temperatures with 99 C. albicans isolates and five antifungal agents confirmed a direct relationship between growth inhibition and increasing temperature from 25 to 40 degrees C with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and terconazole; a strong inverse relationship between inhibition and temperature with amorolfine; and a weak inverse relationship with terbinafine. However, these relationships were not always noted with other Candida spp. : in particular, the growth of C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates tended to be greater at 37 degrees C than at 25 degrees C {{in the presence of the}} azole-derivative antifungal agents itraconazole and <b>terconazole.</b> These findings stress the species-specific individuality of yeast susceptibility to azole antifungal agents. The results with C. albicans and amorolfine and terbinafine accord with their known in vivo efficacy in mycoses involving low-temperature superficial sites and poor activity against mycoses involving deep body sites.
