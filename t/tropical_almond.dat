It is contained in a large, two-story building with over 2 acre of floor space, making it one of the largest indoor tropical environments in the world. The RainForest boasts more than 10,000 plants and over 600 animals from the tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The opening of the RainForest also introduced the Metroparks Zoo's first permanent reptile collection since the flooding in 1959.The RainForest is housed in a large glass and granite building, just outside the main entrance to the Zoo. The structure is divided into an outer ring—featuring an assortment of tropical plants, exhibits containing small mammals, a cafeteria, and a gift shop—and an inner area that contains the principal animal exhibits. Animal habitats are located on both floors of the RainForest. The exhibits contained on the ground floor are collectively known as the [...] "Lower Forest", and those on the second floor are known as the [...] "Upper Forest".Upon entering the RainForest, visitors are immediately greeted by a cascading, 25 ft waterfall and a large tropical garden that soars upwards two stories. The wall behind the waterfall resembles Ancient Mayan ruins. Within the wall are a series of exhibits featuring small, New World mammals such as ocelot, emperor tamarins, Geoffroy's tamarins, Goeldi's marmosets and endangered golden lion tamarins. The outer ring of the RainForest is also home to a wide variety of tropical plants including lancepods, balsam apples, <b>tropical</b> <b>almonds,</b> lipstick trees, numerous varieties of orchid, a kapok tree, and the rare titan arum (corpse flower). The central exhibit, called [...] "Tropical Rain Storm", is a lifelike recreation of a rainforest island where simulated tropical rainfall occurs periodically. The island is inhabited by several Indian porcupines.|$|R

Since our symposium in October, we’ve had one of our least productive winters — hardly any fresh seaweed, and what little there was, didn’t bring with it our normal bounty of drift seeds in Florida. Many of you said it was in keeping with the bad luck so many of us have had this past year, but I think it was to make us more appreciative of the abundant years we had in the past — especially here in Florida — and the ones we’ll have in the future.

40|$|Biodiversity is {{the most}} {{important}} foundation for food security. This is particularly true in the isolated, resource-poor, small island developing states of the Pacific Islands. Food security will ultimately depend on the protection of the cultural and natural ecosystems and services, as well as the knowledge and materials needed to produce and process our food and drinks, for example our forests, reefs, rivers, agricultural systems, firewood and knowledge about farming, fishing, food preservation, processing and cooking, etc. Food security, here, as elsewhere, depends on three sources: wild harvest, agricultural production, and trade. Islanders originally depended almost exclusively on the first two: wild food and water from our forests, non-forest land, rivers and seas, and plant and animal products from our agricultural systems. In terms of wild harvest, Pacific Islanders eat wild yams, ferns, birds, bats, guavas, citrus fruits, <b>tropical</b> <b>almonds,</b> wild leafy greens, and an extremely wide variety of freshwater and marine foods. For example, in eastern Viti Levu, Fiji Islands, the people eat over 200 different types of finfish and over 70 different types of shellfish, crustaceans and marine invertebrates. Over half of these are sold to provide cash incomes and feed the growing urban population. A rich heritage In terms of agricultural production, staple root crops include four taro species, five yam species, sweet potato, and cassava. Important tree crops include coconut, banana and plantain, breadfruit, pandanus, Tahitian chestnut and a wide range of fruit and nut trees. Other locally grown foods include taro leaf spinach, hibiscus spinach, sugarcane and sugarcane inflorescence, corn and many other vegetables, beans and pulses and a wide range of spice and beverage plants. There are wild and locally-raised chickens, ducks, pigs, goats and cows to supply fresh lean meat, eggs and dairy products. These local foods traditionally provided us with all the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, and the fibre and water needed for good health. They are low in salt, sugar and saturated fats. Most of these plants and animals have many different varieties or breeds. For example, in Fiji there are at least 100 named taro varieties, 7 cattle and 5 traditional pig breeds. In the atoll country of Kiribati, there are over 200 edible varieties of pandanus, a staple food plant that will produce during the severest droughts when no other plants can. This genetic diversity adds insurance to our food system, protecting our Today, Pacific Islanders are increasingly dependent on trade and imported foods food plants and animals against diseases and natural disasters, such as hurricanes and drought. Unfortunately, many of these have already disappeared or are disappearing because they have been replaced by new or imported varieties and breeds. Traditional knowledge But perhaps most important is the great knowledge of our diverse cultures, through which we have traditionally known how to collect, hunt, fish, farm and care for wild and domestic plants and animals. Such knowledge includes beliefs, seasonal migrations, recipes, ways of preserving and preparing food, how to breastfeed and nurture babies, as well as the language and names associated with the plants and animals that supply our foods and drinks, and how they affect our health. Today, Pacific Islanders are increasingly dependent on trade and imported foods. This is partly because they live in towns and some of these local foods are now rare or too expensive, or because people no longer know how to catch, produce or prepare them, or have even lost the taste for these foods. Unfortunately, given the purchasing power and low level of nutritional awareness of most of our people, much of the imported food they eat consists of nutritionally inferior products that are high in animal fat, sugar and salt and low in high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals, fibre and water. As a result, Pacific Islanders now have some of the highest and most rapidly increasing levels of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, obesity, dental disease and cancer. An irreplaceable loss Sadly, many of the sources of our nutritious food plants and animals are now endangered. Our mangrove forests and coral reefs are dying or being destroyed. Many of the fish that were common in the past are now rare. Our coastal and inland forests are disappearing and our agricultural lands are being eroded. Many of the traditional varieties of taro, sugarcane, rice, breadfruit, coconut, pandanus and wild yam are dwindling, as are fruit and medicinal trees. Our traditional chicken, pig and goat breeds are disappearing. Of at least equal concern is that the current generation often know few of the names of our fish, shellfish, crabs, wild and cultivated plants and cultivars. They don t know how to hunt, fish, farm, preserve, prepare or eat many of our traditional foods. Young farmers, who don t know the names of our fruit trees and medicinal plants, no longer protect or plant them. In short, because of our ignorance and the shortsightedness of our national planners, we are losing our biodiversity. It is our choice. The sustainable use and protection of island and marine biodiversity is vital for food security for all of our island people.

Silver therapon (Leiopotherapon plumbeus, Kner 1864), locally {{known as}} ayungin, is an {{important}} freshwater food fish species found in Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines. Its market price is twice that of other most sought after freshwater fishes such as tilapia and milkfish. However, intense fishing pressure on the species has significantly reduced the wild stock in Laguna de Bay. Studies to develop hatchery techniques for this indigenous freshwater fish species are therefore needed to produce seedstock for possible culture and wild stock rehabilitation. This study highlights the successful larval rearing of silver therapon in outdoor concrete tanks. Larvae reared in outdoor tanks with natural food (grown two weeks beforehand) reached the juvenile stage (40 days after hatching (DAH)), suggesting the presence of some suitable live food organisms in pre-conditioned rearing water. However, larval survival rates were low (11. 58 Â± 6. 56 % at stocking density of 0. 9 larvae l- 1), which is probably linked to the density of food items, particularly during the onset of exogenous feeding or due to high stocking density of larvae. To improve the availability of natural food for the larvae, fertilization of the rearing water in the outdoor tanks stocked with larvae at two densities (0. 4 and 0. 6 larvae l- 1) was performed. Larval growth and survival were improved at stocking density of 0. 4 larvae l- 1 than at 0. 6 larvae l- 1. Diet composition of first-feeding silver therapon larvae in outdoor tanks inoculated with cultured microalgae (Chorella sorokiniana) and zooplankton was also determined. Larvae were able to consume rotifers and some phytoplankton beginning at 2 DAH and larger preys such as cladocerans and insect larvae starting at 12 DAH. The efficacy of raising silver therapon larvae in outdoor tanks using ambient lake water was also evaluated. Larvae reared in ambient lake water grew well but survival (48. 44 Â± 7. 85 %) was significantly improved in treatments where <b>tropical</b> <b>almond</b> or talisay Terminalia catappa leaves were added {{during the first two}} weeks of larval rearing...|$|E
40|$|This paper brings {{together}} {{many of the}} considerations on multi-species agroforestry (MSA) examined in the above working papers. The complexities in designing MSA mixtures for particular settings are examined. Some parallels and differences are drawn between designs of mixed-species plantation systems that were adopted for rainforest cabinet timbers in tropical north Queensland and MSA systems for ACIAR project focus locations in Fiji and Vanuatu. It is demonstrated that for various reasons the design and financial analysis of MSA systems are much more complex than for mixed-species timber plantations; various biophysical and socioeconomic factors {{must be taken into}} consideration in designing coherent mixtures. In developing MSA system financial models for Fiji and Vanuatu, considerable effort was required to carry out species–site matching for priority tree species, determine technical aspects (such as site amelioration, species compatability, shading requirements and equipment needed), examine labour requirements and cash flows over time, and sketch field layout diagrams for species mixtures including the pattern of intercropping and how this would change over time. Finally, five MSA models which have a relatively high likelihood of being successful in Fiji and Vanuatu according to biological and financial criteria were identified and their rationales described. Detailed financial performance estimates for these models are provided in Working Paper 9 (Screenshots of multi-species financial models and explanatory notes). Also, financial performance has been estimated for eight priority tree and crop species not included in the MSA models, but available as modules for further agroforestry system designs. A table of financial performance for these eight species and interpretation of the findings is provided in Appendix A of this working paper. Calculations have been made in Fiji dollars per hectare of planted area. These species and estimated net present values, and land expectation values as a better criterion for comparison of species, are as follows: whitewood $ 5, 418 ($ 6, 898), vesi –$ 2, 054 (–$ 2, 153), flueggia $ 1, 505 ($ 3, 614), Polynesian chestnut $ 11, 734 ($ 13, 028), <b>tropical</b> <b>almond</b> $ 5, 084 ($ 5, 645), avocado $ 48, 175 ($ 70, 353), banana $ 43, 337 ($ 163, 556) and taro $ 20, 160 ($ 97, 785).

40|$|Eucalyptus cloeziana F. Muell. (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) and the <b>tropical</b> <b>almond</b> Terminalia catappa L. (Myrtales: Combretaceae) {{are widely}} {{cultivated}} in urban and forest areas of many countries where biological control is the most-preferred method to control insects. Aximopsis sp. (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) is {{reported for the}} first time in Brazil in a new group of lepidopteran hosts. Individuals of this species emerged from the pupae of Thyrinteina arnobia arnobia Stoll (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) and Thagona tibialis Walker (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) that developed from larvae defoliating E. cloeziana and T. catappa plants on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Aximopsis sp. was identified by comparing it with species of this group as described for the Neotropical region. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD), France. Twenty new pupae each of Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) were held individually in test tubes with a drop of honey as food and 3 mated Aximopsis sp. females for 2 d. Aximopsis sp. parasitized 20 % of the T. molitor pupae but none of the A. gemmatalis pupae. The duration of the life cycle (egg to adult), parasitism and emergence rates, total individuals emerged from each pupa, sex ratio, length of the body and width of the head capsule, and the longevities of Aximopsis sp. males and females that emerged from parasitized T. molitor pupae were evaluated. The duration of the life cycle of Aximopsis sp. was 14 ± 2 d. An average of 62 ± 5 Aximopsis sp. individuals emerged from each T. molitor pupa, and their sex ratio was 0. 96 ± 0. 02. The total number of parasitoids that emerged was 248 individuals. Measurements of characters of progeny Aximopsis sp. females (n = 10) and males (n = 5), respectively, were as follows: body length: 3. 50 mm (2. 40 ? 3. 80 mm) and 1. 99 mm (1. 97 ? 2. 02 mm); head capsule width: 0. 63 mm (0. 58 ? 0. 72 mm) and 0. 48 mm (0. 46 ? 0. 51 mm), and longevity: 6 ± 1 d and 4 ± 1 d.

40|$|Amendoeira-da-praia ou castanheira, Terminalia catappa L. (Combretaceae); açafrão- da-terra, Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae) e Psychotria spp. (Rubiaceae) ocorrem em todo Brasil, incluindo os locais com cultivos de milho, Zea mays L. (Poaceae). O impacto de extratos e óleo essencial dessas plantas sobre o gorgulho-do-milho, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, 1855 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) e a lagarta-do- cartucho, Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith, 1797 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), pragas do milho, é pouco conhecido. O objetivo desta tese foi avaliar os efeitos inseticida e repelente de extrato bruto de folhas de T. catappa; ar-turmerona, extraída dos rizomas de C. longa e extratos brutos de quatro espécies de Psychotria abundantes no bioma Cerrado (tipo-Savana) do Brasil, sobre adultos de S. zeamais e ovos e lagartas de S. frugiperda. Soluções dos extratos e óleo essencial foram aplicadas sobre grupos de 20 ovos recém-depositados ou com um ou dois dias de idade de S. frugiperda; as lagartas eclodidas oriundas desses ovos foram contadas por grupo de ovos após quatro dias da aplicação das soluções. Lagartas de três dias de idade de S. frugiperda foram introduzidas em copos de plástico sobre a dieta {{artificial}} tratada com as soluções dos extratos e óleo essencial; a mortalidade dessas lagartas foi avaliada a cada 24 h; lagartas sobreviventes após este tratamento, com 13 dias de idade, foram utilizadas para a medição dos parâmetros largura da cápsula cefálica, comprimento e peso corporal; os Índices Nutricionais foram avaliados no segundo e terceiro capítulos desta tese com os dados das lagartas sobreviventes oriundas deste experimento. A mortalidade de S. zeamais foi avaliada até 30 dias da alimentação com grãos de milho tratados com as soluções dos extratos e óleo essencial. Indivíduos de S. zeamais foram pesados antes do início de um experimento e até 30 dias para obtenção da atividade inibidora da alimentação das soluções. A atividade repelente das soluções contra S. zeamais foi realizada tratando 20 g de grãos de milho com as soluções com avaliação após 24 h e a atividade repelente residual com recipientes contendo os grãos de milho tratados reinfestados após terem sido armazenados por até 45 dias; o Índice de Preferência foi calculado no segundo e terceiro capítulos desta tese com os dados de repelência. O extrato de folhas de T. catappa apresentou alto poder ovicida e lagarticida sobre S. frugiperda, controlando maior número de imaturos até o terceiro dia de exposição e reduziu a largura cefálica, o peso e comprimento do corpo das lagartas sobreviventes desse inseto. Indivíduos de S. zeamais morreram após seis dias de contato com ar- turmerona a 1 % (m. m– 1), enquanto os de S. frugiperda mostraram uma taxa de mortalidade de 58 % após ingestão desse composto a 1 % (m. v– 1). A largura da cápsula cefálica, o comprimento e o peso do corpo das lagartas sobreviventes de S. frugiperda expostas a ar-turmerona foram 60, 0 %; 59, 6 % e 93, 8 % menores que aquelas lagartas do controle, respectivamente. Peso seco do alimento ingerido, fezes produzidas, ganho de peso e peso seco do alimento assimilado e metabolizado por lagartas sobreviventes de S. frugiperda foram menores com dieta artificial tratada com ar-turmerona. Eclosão de lagartas de ovos recém-depositados ou com um ou dois dias de idade de S. frugiperda tratados com ar-turmerona foi 48, 63 %; 14, 18 % e 48, 53 %, respectivamente. A toxicidade de Psychotria spp. para as pragas de milho variou entre as espécies e partes (caules ou folhas) dessas plantas; extratos de caules de Psychotria hoffmannseggiana (Willd. ex Roem. & Schult.) Müll. Arg. e de Psychotria capitata Ruiz & Pavon foram mais tóxicos para S. zeamais e aqueles de caules de Psychotria goyazensis Müll. Arg. para S. frugiperda. Os extratos e óleo essencial das plantas testadas têm potencial, em baixas concentrações, para o controle de S. zeamais e S. frugiperda em cultivos de milho no Brasil. <b>Tropical</b> <b>almond,</b> Terminalia catappa L. (Combretaceae); turmeric, Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae) and Psychotria spp. (Rubiaceae) occur throughout Brazil, {{which includes}} sites with crops of corn, Zea mays L. (Poaceae). The impact of extracts and essential oil {{of these plants}} on the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, 1855 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith, 1797 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), corn pests, is little known. The aim of this thesis {{was to assess the}} insecticidal and repellent effects of crude extract of leaves of T. catappa; ar- turmerone, extracted from rhizomes of C. longa and crude extracts of four species of Psychotria abundant in the Cerrado (Savannah-type) biome of Brazil, on adults of S. zeamais and eggs and larvae of S. frugiperda. Solutions of the extracts and essential oil were applied on groups of 20 newly-deposited eggs or with one- or two-days-old S. frugiperda; the hatched larvae obtained from these eggs were counted per group of eggs after four days of solution applications. Three-day-old S. frugiperda larvae were introduced into plastic cups on artificial diet treated with the solutions of the extracts and essential oil; the mortality of these larvae was assessed every 24 h; survival larvae after this treatment, with 13 -days-old, were used for measuring parameters of head capsule width, length and weight; the Nutritional Indexes were assessed {{in the second and third}} chapters of this thesis with data from survival larvae obtained from this treatment. The mortality of S. zeamais was assessed up to 30 days of feeding with corn grains treated with the solutions of the extracts and essential oil. Individuals of S. zeamais were weighed before starting the experiment, and up to 30 days to obtain the inhibitory activity of the feeding on the solutions. The repellent activity of the solutions against S. zeamais was done by treating 20 g of corn grains with the solutions with assess after 24 h and residual repellent activity with the containers with the corn grains treated reinfested after being stored for up to 45 days; the Preference Index was calculated in the second and third chapters of this thesis with data of repellency. The leaf extract of T. catappa showed high ovicidal power and larvicide on S. frugiperda, controlling higher number of immature until the third day of exposure and reduced the head width, the weight and body length of survival larvae of this insect. Individuals of S. zeamais died after six days of contact with ar-turmerone at 1 % (m. v– 1), while those of S. frugiperda showed a mortality rate of 58 % after intake of this compound at 1 % (m. v– 1). The width of the head capsule and the length and body weight of the survival larvae of S. frugiperda exposed to ar-turmerone were 60. 0 %; 59. 6 % and 93. 8 % lower than those of larvae of the control, respectively. Dry weight of ingested food, faeces produced, weight gain and dry weight of the assimilated and metabolized food by survival larvae S. frugiperda were lower with artificial diet treated with ar-turmerone. Hatching of larvae from newly-deposited eggs or with one- or two-days-old S. frugiperda treated with ar-turmerone was 48. 6 %; 14. 2 % and 48. 5 %, respectively. The toxicity of Psychotria spp. for corn pests varied between the species and parts (leaves and stems) of these plants; extracts of stems of Psychotria hoffmannseggiana (Willd. ex Roem. & Schult.) Müll. Arg. and of Psychotria capitata Ruiz & Pavon were more toxic for S. zeamais and those of stems of Psychotria goyazensis Müll. Arg. for S. frugiperda. The extracts and essential oil of the tested plants have the potential, at low concentrations, for the control of S. zeamais and S. frugiperda in corn crops in Brazil...|$|E
