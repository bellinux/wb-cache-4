In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.

[...] "Nobody even <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> could bring a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak."

In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered.

500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. [...] The power. The glory. And he was in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, no question about it." [...] she said. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> didn't have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|E
500|$|Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept {{two sets}} of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson {{and the other for}} {{miscellaneous}} events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work. Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: [...] "Mr. Thrale <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> am not sure what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and all that they can collect about him is put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, if Mrs. Thrale does not intend to do it herself." [...] After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786). The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{the film}} would stand alone; {{producer}} Kevin Feige said [...] "about half" [...] the movie {{would be set}} during World War II before moving into the modern day. Producer Avi Arad said, [...] "The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world {{through the eyes of}} someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?" [...] He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had [...] "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director". In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date. Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead. In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script. He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because [...] "my dad <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> could one day be Captain America". Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E

English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have.
