5|$|In May 1968, protesting {{students}} {{occupied the}} Sorbonne {{and put up}} barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, {{who remained in}} the UK. They {{had to rely on}} journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, February 25, 1917, Danebod Folk School {{burned to}} the grown. Fortunately, the fire burned slowly. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quickly summoned neighbors had time to rescue much of the {{furniture}} and other items of high value. Nearby buildings were saved, but the Folk School was beyond rescue. In the fall of 1917, nine months after the disastrous fire, a new and larger Folk School was dedicated. Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen, C.P. Højbjerg, Aage Møller, P.Rasmussen, and Kristian Østergaard. Meanwhile, a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county, and all churches and schools were temporarily closed {{in an effort to}} halt the deadly disease; but many people died. Another catastrophe followed on August21, 1918, when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County. It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured a dozen more.|$|E

30|$|The {{previous}} section illustrated that <b>the</b> match between <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> university {{is important for}} graduation rates.

5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
5|$|The Philaletheis Society (often {{shortened}} to Philaletheis or just Phil {{and founded}} as The Philalethean Society) {{is a student}} theatre group at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, and the school's oldest student organization. Founded in December 1865, Phil began as a college literary society and its first leader was college president John Howard Raymond. Control of the organization was swiftly handed to <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> group split into three chapters, each with a distinct focus. The group maintained its literary focus until the 1890s, by which point dramatic productions had taken over in popularity. The tradition of producing four and later three plays per year continued into the mid-twentieth century, but in 1958, the organization disbanded due to lack of interest. It was revived in 1975, first as an arm of student government and then as an independent student organization.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} how the educational rituals changed over the time from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey. This study confines Turkish educational rituals to the rituals Goffman (1967) conceptualized as interaction rituals. Interaction rituals are micro daily events and behaviours, including gestures and facial expressions, clothes and symbols, that safeguard <b>the</b> definition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> holiness of <b>the</b> authority, <b>and</b> therefore act as the differentiator. This paper reveals that as education was modernized and institutionalized in Turkey, <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> teacher became more distant. The hierarchical gap between <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> teacher became more visible through educational interaction rituals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> role of the teacher changed within the Republic, from religious authority to soldier citizen...|$|R
