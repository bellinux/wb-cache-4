30|$|Microplastic {{particles}} {{are used as}} exfoliants in certain product segments of specific personal care products, such as hand cleaners, facial cleaners and toothpaste [51]. In the US patent for skin cleaners containing plastic microparticles, polyolefin particles with a size of 74 – 420  µm and an amorphous shape without sharp edges were described as appropriate for use as exfoliants [52]. The used polyolefins include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS; for abbreviations for the plastic resins see also Table  1). Gouin et al. [53] estimated that in 2012, approx. 6  % of the liquid skin cleaning products marketed in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland contained microplastics. Based on a survey conducted by Cosmetics Europe, PE accounted for 93  % of the microplastics used in skin cleaning products in these countries in 2012. The products typically contained between 0.05 and 12  % of microplastic particles, {{with the size of}} most particles ranging from 450 to 800  µm [53]. When analysing skin cleaners, spherical particles (mostly with a rough surface), threads and irregularly shaped particles consisting of PE and PS, and mainly having a blue or white colour were identified [45, 51, 54 – 56]. Microplastics are also used in medical applications, e.g. in dentist <b>tooth</b> <b>polish,</b> and as carriers to deliver active pharmaceutical agents [51, 57]. After use, microplastics from personal care products and such medical products can reach the environment via wastewater.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> dating back to Roman and Greek times. However, Pierre Fauchard, the Father of Modern Dentistry, is credited for the introduction of <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> to remove dental stains. Early polishing pastes consisted of finely ground coral, egg shells, ginger or salt. Within the last century, Dr. Fones, the Founder of Dental Hygiene, began educating students on coronal <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing.</b> Prior to the 1970's <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> was provided to all patients {{as part of their}} complete care. As of the 1990's to 2000's evidence suggests that full mouth polishing is not always necessary.

50|$|<b>Tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> is done {{to smooth}} the {{surfaces}} of teeth and restorations. The purpose of polishing is to remove extrinsic stains, remove dental plaque accumulation, increase aesthetics and to reduce corrosion of metallic restorations. <b>Tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> has little therapeutic value and is usually done as a cosmetic procedure after debridement and before fluoride application. Common practice {{is to use a}} prophy cup—a small motorized rubber cup—along with an abrasive polishing compound.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{precautions}} that clinicians should be aware of when deciding if <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> is indicated. Precautions include; teeth without existing stain, newly erupted teeth, tooth decalcification, hypo-calcification, hypoplasia, demineralization, rampant caries. Areas with exposed root surfaces should also be avoided as well as, areas with tooth sensitivity and gingival inflammation. <b>Tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> should also be avoided in the case of allergies and communicable diseases.|$|R
50|$|Current {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} prophylactic polishing is only necessary when extrinsic stain is {{present on the}} tooth surface. This suggests that <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> {{should be based on}} the clients individual needs.

The enamel surface {{is strong enough to}} withstand repeated <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing,</b> but it should be avoided on newly erupted teeth, exposed root surfaces and areas of demineralization. If polishing does occur on these surfaces, fluoride therapy can minimize the risk of dental caries.

50|$|Generally, dentists {{recommend}} that teeth be cleaned professionally {{at least twice}} per year. Professional cleaning includes <b>tooth</b> scaling, <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing,</b> and, if tartar has accumulated, debridement; this is usually followed by a fluoride treatment. However, the American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA) stated in 1998 {{that there is no}} evidence that scaling and polishing only above the gums provides therapeutic value, and cleaning should be done under the gums as well. The Cochrane Oral Health Group found only three studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in their study and found little evidence in them to support claims of benefits from supragingival (above the gum) tooth scaling or <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{frequency}} of gingival and periodontal disease in HIV-seropositive and AIDS patients {{was investigated in}} order to evaluate the oral hygiene benefits of using mechanical therapy. Study design: thirty-two consenting HIV-positive patients were examined. Their gingival and periodontal status were evaluated using the Gingival Index and the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index. The data were assessed at baseline, after three months and after six months. Subjects received mechanical therapy, which included calculus removal, scaling and root planning, <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> and oral hygiene instructions. The maintenance of oral hygiene was performed weekly. HIV staging and CD 4 counts were also investigated. Results: At the baseline, gingival and periodontal disease was present in 71. 9 % of all subjects. Chronic gingivitis (43. 8 %) was the most frequent in all subjects. A clear improvement in gingival health was registered in 78. 2 % of subjects {{after six months of}} mechanical therapy. No association was registered between CD 4 count and gingival/periodontal status or attachment loss with HIV staging. Conclusions: Chronic gingivitis was the most frequent disease in HIV infected and AIDS patients.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the surface roughness and morphology of enamel with a surface roughness tester and scanning electron microscopy after the removal of metal brackets and polishing. Methods: Ten orthodontic patients were selected for the study. At the conclusion of orthodontic treatment, their metal brackets were removed. For each patient, teeth on one side of the mouth were randomly chosen for finishing and polishing with aluminum oxide discs (n = 10). Teeth on the other side were finished with multilaminated carbide burs (n = 10). Dental replicas (before and after <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing)</b> were obtained with epoxy resin. Three surface roughness measurements were made in different directions with an angle of 120 degrees among them, and a mean for each dental replica was calculated. The roughness data were statistically evaluated by repeated-measurements analysis of variance. Three specimens from each group were also used for scanning electron microscopy analysis. Results: After resin removal, the average roughness in the carbide bur group (0. 31 mu m) was significantly greater than that in the aluminum oxide disc group (0. 25 mm). Conclusions: The aluminum oxide disc polishing system resulted in less enamel roughness than did the multilaminated carbide bur system...|$|R

40|$|The most {{profound}} change ever to affect oral prophylaxis occurred in 1976 {{with the advent}} of selective polishing, which was introduced in the fourth edition of Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist by Esther M. Wilkins, BS, RDH, DMD. 1 The text stated: "Polishing is a selective procedure and not every patient needs to have the <b>teeth</b> <b>polished,</b> especially on a routine basis. " 1 In practice, selective polishing meant that only stained teeth received prophylaxis, and polishing to remove plaque was not necessary because patients could perform this function themselves. Selective polishing was a response to the concern that abrasives in polishing pastes removed the fluoride-rich outer layer of enamel. This theory was based on a study that found 4 µm of enamel was removed during a 30 -second polishing with a pumice-water slurry. 2 Selective polishing was also supported by the fact that polishing for stain removal is not classified as a therapeutic procedure. Proponents of selective polishing suggested that instead of polishing, dental hygienists should spend their time preventing or arresting caries and/or periodontal diseases, providing individualized treatment plans, and educating patients about oral health self-care techniques. 1 Selective polishing may have found support among clinicians, but patients were another matter. Most still desired the oral prophylaxis that left them with the smooth, clean, polished feeling that was "proof " the...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the relative efficacy of a non-degradable osmotic slow-release dosage form containing 6. 6 mg cetylpyridinium chloride (MOTS [Mucosal Oral Therapeutic System] CPC) to inhibit new plaque formation and gingivitis, a single-blind, randomised, parallel group pilot study was set up. 52 healthy volunteers {{were assigned to}} receive {{one of the following}} treatments for 18 days of non-brushing: holding 1 MOTS CPC 2 x daily for 2 h intra-orally, or rinsing 30 s with 15 ml Peridex 2 x daily, or dissolve Cepacol (each 1. 6 mg CPC) lozenges 2 x daily unsupervised. Before the test period, the subjects received a thorough tooth cleaning followed by <b>tooth</b> <b>polishing</b> 1 x a week for 3 weeks to achieve clinical gingival health. After the start of therapy, the subjects were examined at day 4, 7 (+/- 2), 14 (+/- 2) and 18 (2 +/-). Relative efficacy was assessed by the modified Navy plaque index, the Quigley and Hein index, the planimetric plaque index, as well as the papillary marginal gingival index. There was an increase in both plaque formation and gingivitis over the 18 +/- 2 day period of nonbrushing for all subjects in the study. Peridex was the most effective in inhibiting plaque and gingivitis formation over that period of time.

40|$|The {{periodontal}} disease {{is the most}} common disorder of oral cavity of the dogs, being characterized by the inflammation of the gingiva (gingivitis) and periodontium (periodontitis), as a result of aerobic bacteria accumulation on the tooth surface, shaped as a biofilm, creating a microaerophilic environment that enhances the development of pathogenic anaerobic bacteria. The process of gingivitis can be reversed after proper treatment. If untreated, it progresses to periodontitis, an irreversible condition, because of the loss of epithelial adhesion. Animals with periodontitis have bone loss and consequently tooth mobility. This condition has the feeding as the main modifier factor. This means that the more solid is the food, the more friction with the tooth it will do, helping the removal of the biofilm. There are several predisposing factors of this disease, such as race, age, occlusion problems, immunodeficiency, among others. The clinical signs of {{periodontal disease}} may vary, being halitosis and gingivit{{is the most common}} findings. The diagnosis is made by direct inspection, where furcation exposure, inflammation and dental calculus can be seen. The best complementary tool to diagnose is the intra-oral radiography, which allows the visualization of bone structures that can not be seen during clinical inspection, helping to manage the treatment. The use of antibiotics is only complementary to treatment and only chosen in special cases. The treatment for this condition is surgical and requires sedation.

Damage seen in serrated functional teeth from sharks Squalicorax kaupi [1] and Squalicorax pristodontus [1] from the late Cretaceous lowermost Navesink Formation of New Jersey resembles that occurring in modern sharks and suggests similar feeding behavior. Tumbling experiments using serrated modern and fossil functional shark teeth, including those of Squalicorax, show that <b>teeth</b> are <b>polished,</b> not cracked or broken, by post-mortem abrasion in lowermost Navesink sediment.
