6000|$|... 'That doesn't {{sound very}} enthusiastic. Mr Pickering, I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something.</b> Have I done {{anything}} to offend you?' ...|$|E
60|$|CAESAR (seating himself beside her, in {{the most}} amiable of tempers). Just going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about you. You shall hear it. Proceed, Pothinus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] the man said, [...] "I will light a pipe. It's {{against the}} regulations, but that's {{neither here nor there}} now. Now, if you're not sleepy, {{would you mind}} talking <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about yourself, and how you come to be alone here in London. It does me good to talk. It {{prevents}} me from thinking." ...|$|R
6000|$|LILY. Yes, it's very likely, Isey, {{with those}} fine round eyes! (<b>To</b> L.) You'll <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of what you've been saying, to-morrow, won't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mother," [...] cried Mr. Worden, with {{a little}} impatience, at what he fancied mummery, [...] "I am dying to hear what has happened, that I may put the more faith in what is <b>to</b> happen. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of the crop of wheat, I put into the ground, last autumn; how many bushels I sowed, and on how many acres; whether on new land, or on old?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you may be}} able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> {{about his}} early life," [...] replied Harding quietly. [...] "It's a subject he never spoke of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma never says {{anything}} to me. It {{would be no}} good my asking her. Papa, you ought <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> before you go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go, please." [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "I'd like you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about Captain Wegg, {{and of his}} poor wife who died, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|His murmur stopped. He was {{not going}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what this <b>something</b> was. And I didn't care. Anxious to carry the news to my charterers, I ran back on the {{verandah}} to get my hat.|$|R
6000|$|He led the {{way into}} my room, and he sat down as when I had come, and absently watched my {{processes}} of getting into bed. There was something droll, and yet miserable, in his behavior. At first, I {{thought he might be}} staying merely for the comfort of a human presence, and again, I thought he might be afraid, for I felt a little creepy myself, for no assignable reason, except that Absence, which he must have been incomparably more sensible of than I. From certain ineffectual movements that he made, and from certain preliminary noises in his throat, which ended in nothing, I decided that he wished <b>to</b> say <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something,</b> and could not. But I was selfishly sleepy, {{and it seemed to me}} that anything he had on his mind would keep there till morning, at least, and that if he got it off on mine now, it might give me a night of wakeful speculation. So when I got into bed and pulled the sheet up under my chin, I said, [...] "Well, I don't want to turn you out, old fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “If {{your heart}} is full of things like that, then my dear friend, you had better take it out {{and give it to}} the crows. No! you said that for the {{pleasure}} of appearing terrible. And you see you are not terrible at all, you are rather amusing. Go on, continue <b>to</b> be amusing. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of what you heard from the lips of that aristocratic old lady who thinks that all men are equal and entitled to the pursuit of happiness.” ...|$|R
60|$|BRODIE. I {{thought you}} had come <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something.</b> Here I am. For God's sake out with it, and don't stand beating about the bush.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? I {{thought you were going}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> I didn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know you," [...] responded the ranger. [...] "You're that rancher I saw {{working in}} the ditch the day I went to telephone, and you've come <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about that murder." ...|$|E
5000|$|Spence's {{critique}} of a presenter's performance was always formidable, and his influence extended far beyond NBS. As a fledgling DJ Peter Young worked for Spence at UBN and benefited from his training and mentoring. By the time Spence was at NBS, Young was an experienced and accomplished presenter with {{a late night}} show on Capital Radio. [...] "One night he phoned <b>me</b> on air <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> off for <b>something</b> he considered {{to be out of}} order," [...] said Young. [...] "I had to laugh, but was very flattered that he considered it to be worth his while." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{period of}} time after the strike was marked by {{increasing}} economic difficulties. The Philharmonic in 2001 announced efforts to fight off their financial woes, with pay concessions {{on the part of}} the musicians and cut-backs in the management structure, however this was quickly overshadowed by a major change to the orchestra's staff in the later part of the year. In November 2001, the Florida Philharmonic's music director of nearly fifteen years, James Judd, announced his resignation by releasing a press release to the media. When asked about Judd's departure, Bob Levinson, chairman of the Philharmonic's board is quoted as having responded [...] "It's news <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You're <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had left}} me but {{a very short time}} when her father came out on the piazza, his coat buttoned up nearly to his chin. [...] "I have been detained, sir," [...] he said, [...] "by a man who came to see me on business. I cannot remain with you out here, for the air affects me; but if you will come in, sir, I shall be glad to have you do so, without regard to your appearance. My wife is not strong and she has retired, and if it pleases you I shall be very glad <b>to</b> have you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of your duties and success in Walford. Or, if you are fatigued, your room is ready for you, and my man will show you to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. At {{any rate}} I won't {{take it away}} from her. And now I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> else. Do you {{remember}} a fellow we used to know named Berdmore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What we {{are doing}} is our business." [...] Jasper Grinder paused for a moment. [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of that {{treasure}} for which you are seeking," [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I can't hear you," [...] said Mrs. Leake. She had, however, heard this. [...] "But I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about this Caroline Waddington. Isn't it true she's got another lover already?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, {{and then}} suggest {{the most serious}} tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don't care what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine. Don't let us talk about it any more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little bit of {{self-sacrifice}} I have ever known, is really a sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going <b>to</b> be better. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about yourself. What {{is going on in}} town? I have not been to the club for days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear," [...] {{she said}} quietly, {{reaching}} down, untying her little shoe and shaking {{the dust and}} pine needles from its recesses, [...] "no! I don't know {{enough to be a}} wife to you, just now, and you know it. And I couldn't keep a house fit for you, and you couldn't afford to keep ME without it. And then it would be all known, and it wouldn't be us two, dear, and our lonely meetings any more. And we couldn't be engaged--that would be too much like me and Seth over again. That's what you mean, dandy boy--for you're only a dandy boy, you know, and they don't get married to backwood Southern girls who haven't a nigger to bless themselves with since the war! No," [...] she continued, lifting her proud little head so promptly after Ford had recovered from his surprise as to make the ruse of emptying her shoe perfectly palpable, [...] "no, that's what we've both allowed, dear, all along. And now, honey, it's near time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> good--before I go. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> that you love me as you used to--tell me how you felt that night at the ball when you first knew we loved each other. But stop--kiss me first--there, once more--for keeps." ...|$|R
60|$|We are not {{altogether}} without experience, because a year ago, or somewhat more, {{it was my}} good fortune {{to be able to}} appoint two Indian gentlemen to the Council of India sitting at the Indian Office. Many apprehensions reached me as to what might happen. So far, at all events, those apprehensions have been utterly dissipated. The concord between the two Indian members of the Council and their colleagues has been unbroken, their work has been excellent, and you will readily believe me when I say that the advantage to me of being able to ask one of these two gentlemen <b>to</b> come and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about an Indian question from an Indian point of view, is enormous. I find in it a chance of getting the Indian angle of vision, and I feel sometimes as if I were actually in the streets of Calcutta.|$|R
6000|$|He made {{no effort}} to stay me, but I {{could see that he was}} {{bursting}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something.</b> At last, taking a religious paper from his pocket, and pointing to a column, he blurted out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} learnt {{of the death}} of Mrs Haddo. I was her {{guardian}} and her oldest friend. I came to you in the hope that you would be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mrs. Dean, {{it will be}} a {{charitable}} deed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is that I read in Galignani about Lord K-- and {{an affair}} of honour at Baden? Is it my dear kind jolly Kew with whom some one has quarrelled? I know {{those who will}} be even more grieved than I am, should {{anything}} happen to the best of good fellows. A great friend of Lord Kew's, Jack Belsize commonly called, came with us from Baden through Switzerland, and we left him at Milan. I see by the paper that his elder brother is dead and so poor Jack will be a great man some day. I wish the chance had happened sooner if it was to befall at all. So my amiable cousin, Barnes Newcome Newcome, Esq., has married my Lady Clara Pulleyn; I wish her joy of her bridegroom. All I have heard of that family is from the newspaper. If you meet them, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> anything about them.--We had a very pleasant time altogether at Baden. I suppose the accident to Kew will put off his marriage with Miss Newcome. They have been engaged, you know, ever so long.--And--do, do write <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about London. It's best I should--should stay here and work this winter and the next. J. J. has done a famous picture, and if I send a couple home, you'll give them a notice in the Pall Mall Gazette--won't you?--for the sake of old times and yours affectionately, Clive Newcome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are only}} a boy, but you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> I don't know. Your parents read books, and you listen to their {{conversation}} and learn things. We are Roman Catholics, and you are Protestants. We call you heretics and say that for such there is no salvation. Now I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{what is the difference}} between our religion and yours." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{sent for}} you, Annie, because I {{thought you might}} be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many were there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?" ...|$|E
