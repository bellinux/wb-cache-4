25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or <b>the</b> <b>gleam</b> on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E

500|$|The Birmingham News Mary Colurso complemented Mars' capicity to {{demonstrate}} [...] "major charisma", his vocals, the band who backed {{him up and}} the dynamic atmosphere in the arena. Colurso commented that Mars might not have the most deep and breathtaking music, [...] "but he certainly {{knows how to get}} the party started." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post said that it was a [...] "one of those rare, thrilling, upside-down pop concerts", because Mars did not try to recreate <b>the</b> <b>gleam</b> of his most successful tracks, instead he reshaped the songbook at his will, which Richards found amazing. The reviewer also mentioned the wide ranges of genres that Mars approached, including [...] "Motown, new wave, late-’70s funk, mid-’90s R" [...] influenced by pop, which earned him various generations of admirers and fans. However, he criticized the singer for not claiming his own personality through all the [...] "genre-jumping time travel" [...] and for not adding the band name, The Hooligans, on the ticket, as well. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News praised the concert as it tried to recreate the 70's era regarding its entertainment. The reviewer compared it to some acts of that period such as The Jacksons, The Tramps and The Bee Gees. He enlightened Mars' voice matching its [...] "purity, cream and range" [...] to the [...] "mid-period Michael Jackson". Farber compared Mars and Jackson as both of them are [...] "pure entertainers". He pointed, [...] "it hardly seemed to matter that the show wasn’t big on risk or depth." ...|$|E

[...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have {{to fall in love with}} its unlikely hero." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale." [...] Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too." [...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [...] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "No sketchy backgrounds here – Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from <b>the</b> <b>gleam</b> of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters." ...|$|E

During the meeting it was proposed to address a petition to Her Majesty asking her to recall governor Elgin and disavow the indemnification act. In the 1887 account he gave of his participation to the events, some 38 years later, Alfred Perry, the captain of a volunteer corps of firemen, asserted that on that night he stepped on the hustings to speak to the crowd, put his hat on the torch lighting the petition, and exclaimed: [...] "The time for petitions is over, but if the men who are present here are serious, let them follow me to the Parliament Buildings." ...|$|E

Entertainment Weeklys Kevin O'Donnell placed the song at the sixth position amid the 40 best of 2015, hailing it as [...] "blush-inducing, seductive" [...] and describing the track as [...] "the defining soundtrack for every late-night post-club comedown".
