A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanic Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died.|$|E

The Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, where Amy sights her future self on the hillside without Rory. The Doctor <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> object he pulled from the crack: a burnt piece of the TARDIS's sign. He worriedly compares it to the real thing. Aside from the damage, they appear identical.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration. As Homer <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> garbage, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou arrive and issue him {{multiple}} citations and fines - {{the result of}} recently passed, frivolous laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking Moe's suggestion that he bribe a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E

5|$|The gangsters {{have bought}} a weapon off the Brotherhood {{which can help}} them fight against Inhumans. They open the box {{containing}} the weapon, and unleash a mystical being who turns the gangsters berserk. She secretly infects May as well, as the strike force <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> gangsters. Johnson meets with Rodriguez, who stole medication from S.H.I.E.L.D. during their brief check with her which can help Johnson heal—her recent over use of her Inhuman abilities as Quake has been fracturing her bones. Johnson then tracks down the Ghost Rider and confronts it, but it defeats her, explaining that it only murders people that deserve to die. She thinks this should include her, but it refuses to kill her. She later sees the Ghost Rider's human form, Robbie Reyes, looking after his disabled brother Gabe.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out}} to be another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, cricket matches {{have two}} umpires on the field, one {{standing}} at the end where the bowler delivers the ball (Bowler's end), and one directly opposite the facing batsman (usually, but not always, at square leg). However, in the modern game, {{there may be more}} than two umpires; for example Test Matches have four: two on-field umpires, a third umpire who has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire who looks after the match balls, <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> drinks for the on-field umpires, and also arranges travel and meals for all of the umpires.|$|E

25|$|From 2012 onwards any repeat {{airing of}} the music video on {{television}} is now a new re-edited version which <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> appearance of Jimmy Savile. In October 2012, revelations emerged which revealed that Savile {{was one of the}} worst paedophile sex abusers in Britain, and so his appearance on this charity video which helped raised funds for disadvantaged children in Africa and Britain had to be edited out for future broadcasts. The re-edited version is mainly the same as the original except the short 15 second scene with Savile who joined Peter Kay and actress Sally Lindsay is now re-edited to show Sally and Peter only, with a slowed down and repeated showing of Sally on her own next to Peter to fill the gap left by the absence of Savile, thus eliminating Savile from the 15 second section. The original version remains on YouTube.|$|E

The two are tracked to a train station by Coulson's team and a gunman sent by Peterson's doctor. May <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> gunman, and Ward shoots Peterson with an advanced stun gun developed by Fitz and Simmons, which stabilizes his extremis. Afterwards, Coulson offers Skye a place on his team when a call for an [...] "0-8-4" [...] comes in.|$|E
500|$|Games by Apollo {{released}} Lost Luggage in September 1982. Two versions were released, differentiated by {{the color}} of the label. Cartridges with blue labels feature an opening sequence in which the character <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> three starting suitcases. In the green-labeled version, the game may be restarted by pressing the fire button, which does nothing in the blue-labeled version. Neither Salvo nor Runyon were aware of the existence of this version. Runyon speculated that Salvo may have found more space after tweaking the game and added the features, while Salvo did not [...] "remember doing any of this and I can't conceive of anyone at Apollo messing with the game after it went to production." ...|$|E

500|$|After the introduction, {{the song}} follows a {{conventional}} verse-chorus form. The first verse begins one minute into the song, with Bono announcing, [...] "I'm ready, I'm {{ready for the}} laughing gas". During the verses, he sings primarily in a medium-to-low range and his vocals are treated with heavy processing, which <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the sound and [...] "emasculate" [...] his voice. The processing also introduces a wavering quality to his vocals. The guitar glissando continues to be played during the verses. The first chorus begins at 1:44, and the music mirrors the change in chord progression from the introduction's last 15 seconds. During the chorus, the bassline becomes more dynamic, playing descending quarter notes of G–F–D–C–D–C–A–G–A, before resuming the previous G and A pattern. Bono's vocals also become more dynamic in the chorus, featuring layers of both [...] "open-throated" [...] singing and monotone lyric recitation, as well as both processed and unprocessed vocals.|$|E
500|$|... "Family Goy" [...] {{contained}} various cultural references. The episode {{opens with}} a parody of the opening sequence of The All-New Super Friends Hour, with the central characters of Family Guy replacing The All-New Super Friends Hours main characters, except for Meg. When Peter first sees the Kathy Ireland cutout, he starts to sing the Billy Ocean song, [...] "Suddenly". As Lois collects the mail Peter attempts to shoot her, topless and armed with a sniper rifle, but instead hits the mailbox which is reminiscent of a scene in Schindler's List of Amon Göth shooting down Jews in the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in occupied Poland. Stewie's prayer over the candles is a real prayer that women recite before a non-Sabbath festival's start, however, the prayer turns into {{a reference to the}} 1984 adventure film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom where Indian priest Mola Ram <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> heart of a man during a ritual. Peter references William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, but the cutaway gag shows a battle in a spaceship, to which Peter admits that he is not very familiar with Shakespeare's works.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> need for repeats in the back half.|$|E

2500|$|As {{they reach}} a bridge {{that can only}} be used by one person, David volunteers to take the {{challenge}} and snatch the toadstool, but as he attempts to return he is obstructed by phantom knights that drag him underwater. Arthur pulls David to the surface and helps him get back to dry land. However, once there, they discover that the toadstool is no longer in David's bag. After returning empty-handed, Arthur offers David a seat at the Knights of the Round Table, except that he is offered Lancelot's seat (the Siege Perilous) instead of Percival's. However, later that evening, Mary Margaret comes across a very much alive Lancelot, who warns her that the Dark One isn't the only villain in Camelot. its King Arthur. Lancelot says that Camelot is [...] "not what it seems" [...] and insinuates that King Arthur is evil. The insinuation is corroborated, as Guinevere joins Arthur at the Round Table, he <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> toadstool that was supposedly lost to add to the reliquary, which holds the magic relics collected by the knights. While it brought Arthur no pleasure to lie to someone he sees as a good and noble man, he tells Guinevere that he must think of his kingdom first.|$|E
