In icing conditions, water droplets condensing on a wing's leading edge can freeze.

To prevent <b>this,</b> <b>hot</b> bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.|$|E

Dewpoints as high as 81°F (27°C) have been recorded during the Phoenix monsoon season. <b>This</b> <b>hot</b> moisture brings lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours.

Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths.
