5000|$|Speaking to Melody Makers Harvey Kubernik {{in early}} 1977, Harley commented: [...] "I feel {{on this album}} I achieve {{something}} as a singer, producer and songwriter.

Theres a lot of different music styles that are confusing some people. Its taken the maturity of an older man <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> things in the first person. When I first started writing the album, six of the lyrics dealt with love. So I thought Id follow this with the rest of it. Its an album which dwells on the emotion we call love. I became very confident writing this album. Ive come back stronger now cause I believe in myself. I like writing all about human relationships. There is also humour in this LP: [...] "GI Valentine," [...] and [...] "Give Me More".|$|E

I would rather do away with myself than let the police find anything about me.' My mother told me always to call her father, and not let Mrs. Birkett nor anyone else know that she was a woman. I did not know that my mother was married to Mrs. Birkett, but they occupied the same bed-room. They quarrelled a great deal, and mother used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'More rows over you. I cannot get any sleep.' I replied to my mother, and she said, 'Oh, a lovely daughter I've got.' I said, 'What can you expect? A lovely mother I've got.' In 1917 I met my mother, who told me everything was unsettled and upside down, as Mrs. Birkett had discovered she was a woman. My mother seemed very agitated, and was always reticent about herself." ...|$|E
