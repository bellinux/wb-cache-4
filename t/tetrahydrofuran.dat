5|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in <b>tetrahydrofuran</b> (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in <b>tetrahydrofuran.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being <b>tetrahydrofuran.</b> The most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in <b>tetrahydrofuran</b> to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in <b>tetrahydrofuran.</b>|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in <b>tetrahydrofuran.</b> Contrary to cyclopentadienides {{of most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tetrahydrofurans</b> and tetrahydropyrans {{are common}} {{structural}} features of numerous natural products, {{most notably the}} marine toxins and the polyether antibiotics, such brevetoxin and monensin. Despite the structural complexity of these two classes of compounds, a similarity arises when comparing the structural cores. The framework of all polyether antibiotics contains 2, 5 -disubstituted <b>tetrahydrofurans,</b> substituted tetrahydropyrans and spiroketal systems. A characteristic feature {{in the core of}} marine toxins is a trans-fused polycyclic ether moiety. Because of these similarities, it is believed that polycyclic ether compounds have a similar biogenetic origin, and many groups have postulated that Nature synthesizes these compounds via a polyene→polyepoxide→polyether pathway. Based on previous Wipf group methodology, enantiomerically pure diepoxide substrates with electronically differently ester terminating groups were subjected to 10 mol% Cp₂ZrCl₂ and 20 mol% AgClO₄.

This work demonstrates the first examples of intramolecular cyclisation of tethered hydroxyl groupings onto 1, 2 -dioxines generating functionalised THFs {{in a highly}} stereoselective manner and includes improved methods for previously reported carboxylic acid tether cyclisations. Additionally, improved methods for the oxidation of 1, 2 -dioxines containing tethered alcohols to furnish tethered carboxylic acids are also detailed.
