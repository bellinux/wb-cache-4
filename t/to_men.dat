5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior <b>to</b> <b>men.</b> The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior <b>to</b> <b>men.</b> The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E

40|$|John Donne was a {{firm believer}} in the circle and the {{circular}} world around him. Circle images are pervasive in his poetry, such as the compass image in "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning, " and the lovers as a world in "The Sunne Rising. " Donne used circle imagery to express a variety of relationships, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> woman, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> God, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> himself, and <b>man</b> <b>to</b> nature. I have picked three poems which best show Donne's complex and intense use of the circle. All three involve a journey, a circular journey. It is through each of these circular journeys that the particular relationship is clarified, felt, and understood. The first poem is "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning," which deals with the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> woman relationship. The second poem, "Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward," is concerned with the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> God relationship, which also involves the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> self relationship. The third poem, "The First Anniversarie," is more complicated in both its imagery and its tone than the first two poems. Unlike the other two poems, it is concerned not with one relationship, but several, encompassing <b>man</b> <b>to</b> God, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> himself, <b>man</b> <b>to</b> nature and <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>man...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E
5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak <b>to</b> <b>men</b> only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.|$|E

Other evidence of the presence of women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance and the importance of women in Athenian rituals, especially those associated with Dionysus.|$|E
