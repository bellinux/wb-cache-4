40|$|Operation of ship {{propulsion}} system {{is associated with}} realization of definite operational goals. If to elements of the system the operational reliability strategy could be applied, the situation would be very simple as existing conditions would unambiguously determine application of means being on hand. However decision <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> <b>application</b> of the strategy (even if hypothetical) becomes obvious {{with a view of}} necessity of ensuring an acceptable level of safety to ship and environment as well as presence of associated formal and legal limitations. Therefore complexity of operational reality makes that means intended for operation may be used in various ways. Objectivity and rationality in making decision, assumed optimal in given conditions, forces to apply an evaluating (quantitative) approach to the problem, hence to search for such their parameters (indices) which, in a given decision situation, can be deemed most adequate. To precisely determine the task it is necessary to specify also its duration time, apart from conditions in which it will be realized. When considering propulsion engine, i. e. the main element of ship {{propulsion system}}, especially important becomes not only the problem which amount of energy could be at one’s disposal but also within which time interval it could be delivered. Therefore apart from applying the commonly used reliability indices, it seems sensible to consider the operation in such evaluating approach as it could be determined by energy and time simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} timing and pattern of {{adoption}} of "shall issue" concealed-carry handgun laws. "Shall issue" laws require the authorities to issue permits to qualified applicants; "may issue" laws give the authorities more latitude <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> <b>applications.</b> We find three factors influence the shift from "may issue" to "shall issue. " First, more urban states {{are less likely to}} shift to "shall issue," although the size of this effect is quantitatively small. Second, the switch is influenced by the decisions taken by neighboring states. Third, we find evidence that increases in the crime rate accelerated the switch to "shall issue.

40|$|Start-up {{subsidies}} for the unemployed {{have long been}} an important active labor market policy strategy in Germany. The current subsidy program underwent a major reform in 2011 that changed its key parameters: support was lowered, eligibility criteria were tightened and entitlement was abandoned by granting caseworkers the right <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> <b>applications.</b> Ex-ante predictions on the post-reform effectiveness of the program are ambiguous, and knowledge {{about the importance of}} institutional details of such a program is very limited, making a new evaluation necessary. In our descriptive analysis, we compare personal and business characteristics of participants before and after the reform and we find significant differences in terms of gender composition, educational attainment and industry-specific experience. Post-reform participants also perform better in terms of subsequent labor market integration and show signs of higher commitment. These findings give us some indication for interpreting our estimates of causal effects of the post-reform program. We find that for both men and women, employment and income effects of the post-reform program are positive, sizable, and larger than what was estimated for the pre-reform program. All in all, the programs effectiveness seems to have improved through the reform. Potential reasons for this are discussed and include better screening of participants by caseworkers, higher rates of commitment and changes in macroeconomic conditions...|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{unavailability}} {{of certain}} car models, demand for grey market vehicles {{arose in the}} late 1970s.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} municipal fiscal climates on eligibility assessments in the Japanese system of long-term care insurance (LTCI). We find that municipalities with more stringent fiscal climates tend <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> more <b>applications</b> for LTCI benefits, almost certainly {{in the hope of}} containing benefit expenditures. This would not be a serious problem if financial assistance from the upper levels of government counteracted the adverse effect. However, we also find that the effects of the assistance are almost negligible, despite layers of intergovernmental subsidies for municipal LTCI expenditures. In other words, horizontal equity in Japanese long-term care insurance is compromised for the sake of gatekeeping...|$|R
