5|$|Britain's {{railways}} were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and {{the former}} Great North of Scotland Railway lines were placed {{under the control of}} the Scottish Region of British Railways. <b>To</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> the Alford branch was closed to passengers on 2 January 1950, followed by the Macduff Branch on 1 October 1951.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general {{standard}} of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Oslo Sporveier {{announced}} that it would close the Ekeberg, Sinsen, Briskeby and Kjelsås Lines <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b> Only the Kjelsås Line was actually closed and replaced by buses, which occurred 21 November 2002. After local protests, and a compromise in the city council, the Kjelsås Line was reopened on 22 November 2004.|$|E

5|$|The F 3 {{appeared}} in 1939 {{and was the}} production version. The design was simplified {{over the course of}} the war <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> and the use of strategic metals. Some vehicles produced by Tatra had its 12-cylinder, air-cooled Type 103 diesel engine fitted. Large spades were added at the rear of the chassis during the war to improve the vehicle's ability to recover tanks and other heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF and Army jointly {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} the Chinooks from service in May 1989. This decision was made <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability. Due to the Chinooks' high operating costs, only six of the helicopters were in service at the time. No. 12 Squadron ceased flying on 30 June 1989, and was disbanded on 25 August that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} were unsuitable due to poor {{risk analysis}} and necessary requirements {{omitted from the}} procurement contract. The Times claimed that the Ministry of Defence planned to perform software integration itself, without Boeing's involvement, in order <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b> While lacking certification, the helicopters were only permitted to fly in visual meteorological conditions and subsequently stored in climate controlled hangars.|$|E

5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{the project}} met with delays {{to work on}} tramway infrastructure. Phase 1b {{of the project was}} {{cancelled}} because of a funding shortfall in April 2009. Contractual disputes delayed track-laying in the city centre. In December 2009, media reported that the project budget was running over £545 million, and the system was unlikely to come into operation until February 2012 or later. The operating contract with Transdev was cancelled in December 2009 <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> and it was announced that the trams would be operated by Edinburgh Trams Limited, a subsidiary of Transport for Edinburgh. In March 2010, Bilfinger Berger announced that the estimated completion date would be in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{technology}} and systems used on Black Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the Black Knight rocket, or the Blue Steel missile. Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible in order <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black Arrow, including the Chief Missile Scientist, Roy Dommett, the Chief Design Engineer, Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer, John Underwood.|$|E
5|$|SAS Commuter was {{established}} in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990, making Alta its central hub for Finnmark. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Alta to Oslo were flown non-stop. Conversely, all services to airports in Northern Norway were flown using the smaller Fokker 50. Thus SAS was able <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9/MD-80 and instead {{increased the number of}} flights. The change made Alta the only airport in Finnmark with direct services to Oslo. From 1989 to 1990, the number of annual aircraft movements at Alta hiked from 7,711 to 10,035.|$|E
5|$|SAS Commuter was {{established}} in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Kirkenes to Oslo were terminated and instead Fokker 50 services were introduced to Alta and Tromsø. SAS was able <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9 and instead {{increased the number of}} flights. The new system was met with massive opposition in Kirkenes. Emergency meetings were being held between SAS Commuter and the ministry by June 1990 because of low regularity and many cancellations. Non-transfer flights from Kirkenes to Oslo were reintroduced on 1 April 1992, albeit with the services stopping at Tromsø.|$|E

5|$|Studio {{executives}} Mechanic and Ziskin planned {{an initial}} budget of US$23million {{to finance the}} film, but {{by the start of}} production, the budget was increased to $50million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to US$67million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> by at least US$5million. The director refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing. The final production budget was $63million.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} painted white to aesthetically {{distinguish it from}} both Safeco Field and the nearby industrial area. The {{east side of the}} stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and {{the west side of the}} structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. <b>To</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> no alien {{spacecraft}} is seen at {{the start}} of the film; instead, Kator's arrival is conveyed solely by flashing lights and sound effects. As the low budget also precluded the use of an orchestra, composer Ivor Slaney devised a synthesised score featuring occasional contributions from traditional instruments (such as a piano) that he recorded himself. Slaney also composed for Warren's next film, Terror (1978). The soundtracks for Prey and Terror were released jointly on CD in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Virtue's Last Reward was {{developed}} by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who had previously led the production of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. While his original intention was to make Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors a stand-alone title, its unexpected critical success in North America prompted him to continue the series. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> Uchikoshi asked Chunsoft if he could develop Virtue's Last Reward and its eventual sequel simultaneously, as both games would use the same engine and digital assets; Chunsoft agreed to his proposal, and green-lit production.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} are working <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> of electric power from offshore wind. One {{example is the}} Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001. At the Interior Department, Berry improved credit union and continuing education options, oversaw {{the expansion of}} department programs to improve employees' work-life balance, and held town hall meetings with Interior employees and used their suggestions to upgrade a cafeteria and health center. These changes were partly funded through partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards. He helped establish an office supply store for Interior employees, which he staffed with disabled workers. Berry oversaw {{one of the largest}} budgetary increases in the department's history.|$|E
