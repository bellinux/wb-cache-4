[...] The day after Wilder turned 13, he called the teacher, who accepted him; Wilder studied with him for two years. He adopted [...] "Gene Wilder" [...] for his professional name at the age of 26.|$|E

In contrast, a Free School <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> that the school's graduates were better able to empathize and emotionally interact, and thus were better equipped to address the fear and mistrust of authority that leads to [...] "laws, judges, courts, prisons".|$|E

He was hyperactive as a boy, with a restless imagination and a particular fondness for The Goon Show and music. Moon attended Alperton Secondary Modern School after failing his eleven plus exam, which precluded his attending a grammar school. His art <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> in a report: [...] "Retarded artistically. Idiotic in other respects". His music teacher wrote that Moon [...] "has great ability, but must guard against a tendency to show off." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{appreciation}} of his work, Dance <b>Teacher</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Kidd drew from the vocabularies of ballet, modern, social dance and acrobatics. But above all, his choreography stemmed from realistic movements and gestures. Following {{in the tradition}} of Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins, who developed the integrated musical, Kidd created dances that helped to carry the plot and flesh out the characters. He put the story first, communicating it through dance." [...] Kidd once said that [...] "every move, every turn should mean something. Dancing should be completely understandable." [...] In Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he employed leading ballet dancers, but insisted that his dancers avoid ballet dance moves, and instead focus on [...] "work movements like ax wielding".|$|E
2500|$|Teachers {{also showed}} some sympathy for McInerney. [...] "We failed Brandon," [...] a <b>teacher</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We didn't know the {{bullying}} {{was coming from}} the other sideâ€”Larry was pushing as hard as he could, because he liked the attention." [...] Hundreds of children from the school have signed a petition requesting that McInerney be tried as a juvenile.|$|E

2500|$|Botham {{went on to}} Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School {{where he}} {{continued}} {{to do well in}} sport and played for the school's cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of Somerset County Cricket Club's youth coach Bill Andrews. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer. When informed {{that he wanted to be}} a sportsman, Botham's careers <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> to him: [...] "Fine, everyone wants to play sport, but what are you really going to do?" ...|$|E

60|$|The last {{sentence}} is not original. Albert's Sunday-school <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> it to Albert {{on the occasion}} of his taking up his duties at the castle, and it stuck in his memory.

60|$|The teacher interfered, and by {{the united}} {{influence}} of authority, management, and persuasion, succeeded in effecting a rescue. The boy would probably have preferred to owe his safety to any one else, than to the teacher, whom he had so often tried to tease; but {{he was glad to}} escape in any way. The <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> nothing about the subject, and the boy soon supposed it was entirely forgotten.|$|E

In {{both public and private}} schools, the <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> that a main English textbook for reading and an English language learning magazine for listening comprehension were used. Supplementary textbooks on English grammar, vocabulary, and English proficiency tests, such as the TOEIC and General English Proficiency Test, were frequently used in the regular and afterschool English classes. Listening articles, conversations, or passages in the English magazines were played to all students in class once a week. During the 30 -min listening sessions, students sometimes listened to the recordings and read the magazine, or took a listening quiz.|$|R

6000|$|Every one mourned for her, and all {{her small}} treasures were so {{carefully}} kept that they still exist. Poor Horta, in the pincushion arm-chair, seems waiting patiently for the little mamma to come again; the two rag-dolls lie {{side by side in}} grandma's scrap-book, since there is now no happy voice to wake them into life; and far away in the convent of San Antonio the orphans carefully keep their pretty gifts in memory of the sweet giver. To them she is a saint now, not a fairy princess; for when they heard of her death they asked if they might pray for the soul of the dear little Americana, and the <b>teacher</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Pray rather for the poor mother who has lost so much." [...] So the grateful orphans prayed and the mother was comforted, for now another little daughter lies in her arms and kisses away the lonely pain at her heart.|$|E
