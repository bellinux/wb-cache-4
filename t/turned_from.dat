5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Filming started {{shortly before}} 7.00pm, and ended at around 8.30pm; Griffin left the {{building}} 10 minutes later. Audience members inside the studios used their mobile phones to relay live information about the recording's progress. James Lyons, political correspondent for the Daily Mirror, wrote that {{the mood in the}} studio <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> anger to mockery of Griffin.|$|E

5|$|In England, Anne largely <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> {{political}} {{to social}} and artistic activities. Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{where there}} was an {{increasing}} interest in {{the remains of the}} city's pagan past, where scholars <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> reading Medieval Church Latin to Classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of St Augustine, the presence, in the Sistine Chapel of five pagan prophets is not surprising.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Takechi <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> {{the stage to}} the cinema. Though the {{mainstream}} film industry considered Takechi an amateur and an outsider, {{he would continue to}} produce ground-breaking films sporadically {{for the rest of his}} life. Some of the innovations and trends in Japanese erotic cinema which Takechi's films pioneered include big-budgets and releases, literary and artistic aspirations, fogging, political themes, and theatrical hardcore.|$|E

5|$|While {{the early}} 19th century had seen rapid {{progress}} in electrical science, the late 19th century {{would see the}} greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life, becoming a driving force of the Second Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the {{allegations}} regarding the News of the World continued to receive {{coverage in the}} broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in a performance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E

5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant {{was created}} by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first {{featured}} in the magazine Children's Activities in 1940. According to family legend, the grandchildren of Myers and his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and Gallant respectively. At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded Highlights for Children, they brought Goofus and Gallant {{with them to the}} new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and Gallant <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> elves to human boys. Throughout Goofus and Gallants history, numerous artists have drawn for the strip, including Marion Hull Hammel, who illustrated the strip for 32 years beginning in the early 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In October 1939, Heikkinen {{was hired}} as the line coach at the University of Virginia, where he also studied law. An {{influential}} alumnus of Virginia interviewed Heikkinen when the Dodgers played the Detroit Lions and was instrumental in securing Heikkinen’s position with Virginia. Heikkinen worked as Virginia’s line coach from 1940 to 1944 and graduated first in his class from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1944. Fellow Michigan All-American, Edliff Slaughter, was also a Virginia coach with Heikkinen. During World War II, in 1943, Slaughter and Heikkinen <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> coaching to teaching aerial navigation at the University of Virginia Flight Preparatory School.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910s, 2100 South in Salt Lake County {{became an}} {{unnumbered}} state highway. In 1919, {{when the state}} legislature redefined the state road system to include only a short list given in the law and any federal aid projects, 2100 South east of State Street remained as {{a portion of the}} Lincoln Highway. In 1926, 2100 South became part of US-40, following the creation of the United States Numbered Highway system. By 1937, 2100 South west of 9180 West was assigned to US-50, US-40 now turning northward toward Downtown Salt Lake City. This created two signed highways over 2100 South: US-40 east of US-91 and US-50 east of 9200 West (US-50 traveled west on 3500 South through Salt Lake City from US-91 to 2100 South in Magna, whereas US-40 <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> eastbound 2100 South to northbound State Street to connect to North Temple).|$|E

Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E

5|$|Severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic {{damage and}} {{flooding}} from Lake Okeechobee {{that prompted the}} Army Corps of Engineers to build a dike around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> developing the land to restoring the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Ottoman Army's war effort in 1918 <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> Palestine to Anatolia, to the provinces and territories lost by their empire between 1877 and 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. This change of {{direction}} was heavily influenced by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed in March 1918 which ended the war on the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and the Central Powers. As a result, the Ottoman Army embarked {{on a series of}} territorial conquests in the Caucasus. Erzerum, which had been captured by the Russians during the Erzerum Offensive in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. The reoccupation of these former Ottoman possessions, however, brought little strategic advantage, compared with the potential benefits of military success in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{committed}} by Burke and Hare raised {{public awareness of}} the need for bodies for medical purposes, and of the trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King's College London led to an investigation of the London Burkers, who had recently <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.|$|E
