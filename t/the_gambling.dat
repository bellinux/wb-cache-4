5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue.

5|$|Mahjong: The Dutch {{journalist}} and writer Jelte Rep writes that <b>the</b> <b>gambling</b> game of mahjong (Traditional Chinese: 麻將; Pinyin: májiàng), which employs {{a set of}} over a hundred tiles, was first invented in 1846 by Zhen Yumen, a Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) diplomatic official from Ningbo. However, Rep traces {{the origins of the}} game to a card game of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which used thirty-two wood or ivory pieces in the shape of cards. This evolved into the forty-card game of madiao (馬吊) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), which had four suits of cards instead of the three found in modern mahjong.|$|E

5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority {{to decide how to}} allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as <b>the</b> <b>Gambling</b> Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, on the facts of the case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E
5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In <b>the</b> <b>gambling</b> house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E

40|$|Risky {{decision}} making, and how {{it changes}} over the lifespan, is important for theory and public policy. Studies examining decision making from childhood through adolescence on to adulthood have rarely examined choice on the same task. However, this is crucial in order to fully understand the factors that affect decisions through development and to make defensible comparisons. A framing task was administered to groups of 2 nd graders (n = 31), adolescents (n = 35), and adults (n = 41). Of interest is how factors affected choices between a sure option and an option that involved risk. In addition to choices, ratings were elicited on a 7 -point smiley-face scale to indicate degree of preference. Factors that were examined include frame (gain, loss), risk (. 5,. 67, and. 75), reward magnitude ($ 5, $ 20, and $ 150), induced and measured mood of the decision maker (positive, neutral, or negative), and the decision makers' optimism. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that participants chose <b>the</b> <b>gamble</b> option more when options were presented as losses versus when they were presented as gains (a standard framing pattern). Overall, participants chose <b>the</b> <b>gamble</b> most at <b>the</b> lowest risk level (defined as the probability of the bad outcome in <b>the</b> <b>gamble),</b> and chose <b>the</b> <b>gamble</b> less often as the reward magnitude increased. This effect was qualified by a reward magnitude by age group interaction. The decreasing trend in choosing <b>the</b> <b>gamble</b> was found only for adults and adolescents. The decrease in choices of <b>the</b> <b>gamble</b> as magnitude differences increased (favoring <b>the</b> <b>gamble)</b> is further evidence for fuzzy-trace theory's explanation that standard framing results from gist-based processing in adults. Children's opposite trend, favoring larger outcomes in <b>the</b> <b>gamble,</b> is consistent with fuzzy-trace theory's developmental prediction that younger subjects would be more verbatim processors. Negative mood was found to increase verbatim processing, indicated {{by an increase in}} reverse framing (greater preference for <b>the</b> <b>gamble</b> in <b>the</b> gain frame than in the loss frame, the opposite of standard framing). Participants in neutral and positive moods showed the standard framing pattern. Decisions were not found to be influenced by the level of optimism...|$|R

5|$|During the 1946 postseason, rumors {{began to}} swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was {{lobbying}} Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher {{to leave the}} Dodgers and manage the Yankees.

In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—Chuck Dressen and John Corriden—as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris {{while they were still}} employed by the Dodgers.

5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of <b>the</b> <b>gambling</b> instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|Most British breeders {{thought the}} {{regulation}} necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, {{and believed that}} it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of <b>the</b> <b>gambling</b> bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.|$|E
5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either <b>the</b> <b>Gambling</b> Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E
