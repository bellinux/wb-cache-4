The design and testing of Probe and Reader concepts are discussed, and the advantages and weaknesses of each design are determined. The performance of the passive IF amplitude-modulated MBM system is analyzed. The passive-AM MBM system achieves better range than CPCA modulation, and does not require as many components and power as the active circular-polarization modulation system.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in communications, electronics, and RF energy-harvesting indicate that extraordinarily long separation distances (100 m or more) between readers and passive microwave transponder-sensors are possible – even for readers that obey low-power, unlicensed spectrum regulations. Backscatter communication is a remarkably low-powered method for exchanging radio information. Its most common use today {{is in the}} field of radio frequency identification (RFID), where a transceiver unit (i. e. reader) retrieves identification information from an RF <b>transponder</b> <b>tag</b> that backscatters a waveform as it adds modulated data. This technique requires so little power at the RF tag that it is often possible to run the tag electronics off of energy harvested from the impinging RF waveform [Dev 05, Dob 07]. Recent {{advances in}} energy-harvesting microwave communications will enable extraordinarily long ranges – and new applications – for passive transponders [Dur 10]. These following techniques provide significant gains for these passive systems. Power Optimized Waveforms (POW) : Power optimized waveforms are energizing RF signals that are tailored for collection by energy-harvesting circuits [Tro 09].

The most innovative research is related to affordable interrogation within complex environment, to the identification of metal objects, to the efficient scavenging of environmental energy, {{to the development of}} miniaturized active system with high autonomy, to low cost sensorial tags and to the biomedical telemetry.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{radio-frequency}} identification (RFID) {{technology has been}} widely integrated into modern society applications, ranging from barcode successor to retail supply chain, remote monitoring, detection and healthcare, for instance. In general, an RFID tag or transponder is composed of an antenna and an application-specific integrated circuit chip. In a passive UHF RFID system (which {{is the focus of}} presented research), the communication between the <b>transponder</b> <b>tag</b> and the reader is established by modulating the radar cross section (RCS) of the <b>transponder</b> <b>tag.</b> The need for flexible RFID tags has recently been increased enormously; particularly the RFID tags for the UHF band ensure the widest use but in the meantime face considerable challenges of cost, reliability and environmental friendliness. The multidimensional focus of the aforementioned research encompasses the production of low-cost and reliable RFID tags. The state-of-the-art fabrication methods and materials for proposed antennas are evaluated in order to surmount the hurdles for realization of flexible green electronics. Moreover, this work addresses the new rising issues interrelated to the field of economic and eco-friendly tags comprising of paper substrate. Paper substrates offer numerous advantages for manufacturing RFID tags, not only is paper extensively available, and inexpensive; it is lightweight, recyclable and can be rolled or folded into 3 D configurations. The most important aspect of an RFID system's performance is the reading range. In this research several pivotal challenges for item-level tagging, are resolved by evolving novel structures of progressive meander line, quadrate bowtie and rounded corner bowtie antennas in order to maximize the reading distance with a prior selected microchip under the various constraints (such as limited antenna size, specific antenna impedance, radiation pattern requirements). This approach is rigorously evolved for the realization of innovative RFID tag antenna which has incorporated humidity sensor functionality along with calibration mechanism due to distinctiveness of its structural behavior which will be an optimal choice for future ubiquitous wireless sensor network (WSN) modules. The RFID market has grown in a two-dimensional trend, one side constitutes standalone RFID systems. On the other side, more ultramodern approach is paving its way, in which RFID needs to be integrated with broad operational array of distinct applications for performing different functions including sensors, navigation, broadcasting, and personal communication, to mention a few. Using different antennas to include all communication bands is a straightforward approach, but at the same time, it leads to increase cost, weight, more surface area for installation, and above all electromagnetic compatibility issues. The indicated predicament is solved by realization of proposed single wideband planar spirals and sinuous antennas which covers several bands from 0. 8 - 3. 0 GHz. These antennas exhibit exceptional performance throughout the operational range of significance, thus paving the way for developing eco-friendly multi-module RF industrial solutions.

40|$|AbstractElectronic animal {{identification}} {{is an important}} technology in modern animal husbandry providing great benefits. Low-frequency applications are state-of-the-art within the radio frequency identification of animals. Quasi-simultaneous detection of several animals and reading of the transponders over longer distances is impossible with low-frequency systems. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) applications are suitable for this purpose. However, UHF systems have disadvantages through their susceptibility to metallic surfaces and liquids. Thus, the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the animals' environment is often problematic. Consequently, an adjustment of the <b>transponder</b> ear <b>tags</b> regarding mechanical stability and functionality close to water (ear tissue) is necessary. In this project, targeted adjustments and a further development of UHF <b>transponder</b> ear <b>tags</b> concerning the resonance frequency were made. Three trials with cattle and two trials with pigs were performed in this study. Cattle were driven through a reader gate for ten rounds and six different types of <b>transponder</b> ear <b>tags</b> designed in-house were tested. The influence of the environment (indoor vs. outdoor), reader orientation at the gate (sideways vs. above) and output power of the readers (1. 0 vs. 0. 5 W) were tested in two experiments. The average number of readings per round and the reading rates of the <b>transponder</b> ear <b>tag</b> types were taken as target variables. In the trials with pigs, three <b>transponder</b> ear <b>tag</b> types were compared. The animals were driven through the gate for five rounds per repetition, but neither the reader output power nor the reader orientation were varied. The pig experiments were performed indoors. The results of the cattle experiments showed that {{the average number of}} readings per round and the reading rates were significantly higher indoors compared to outdoors. The reader output power of 1. 0 W achieved significantly better results compared to 0. 5 W. The same applied to the reader orientation ‘above’ compared to ‘sideways’. It could also be shown that an improvement of the transponder and, thus, an adjustment to the animal's ear could be achieved during <b>transponder</b> ear <b>tag</b> type development. A maximum reading rate of 100 % was reached with the cattle transponder types finally developed (B 3 - 4, B 4 - 4 and B 5).

40|$|Although {{the costs}} of parental care are at the {{foundations}} of optimal-parental-investment theory, {{our understanding of the}} nature of the underlying costs is limited by the difficulty of measuring variation in foraging effort. We simultaneously measured parental provisioning and foraging behavior in a free-living population of Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) using an electronic monitoring system. We fitted 145 adults with a passive <b>transponder</b> <b>tag</b> and remotely recorded their visits to nest boxes and feeders continuously over a 2 -month period. After validating the accuracy of this monitoring system, we studied how provisioning and foraging activities varied through time (day and breeding cycle) and influenced the benefits (food received by the offspring) and costs (interclutch interval) of parental care. The provisioning rates of wild Zebra Finches were surprisingly low, with an average of only one visit per hour throughout the day. This was significantly lower than those reported for this model species in captivity and for most other passerines in the wild. Nest visitation rate only partially explained the amount of food received by the young, with parental foraging activity, including the minimum distance covered on foraging trips, being better predictors. Parents that sustained higher foraging activity and covered more distance during the first breeding attempt took longer to renest. These results demonstrate that in some species matching foraging activity with offspring provisioning may provide a better estimate of the true investment that individuals commit to a reproductive attempt. 10 page(s...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of single-suture incision closures on five response variables in juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that were subjected to simulated turbine passage.

We captured wild zebra finches around 2 breeding colonies and assayed their exploratory behavior with a novel environment test. The birds’ foraging behavior in the wild was also measured with the use of a passive integrated <b>transponder</b> <b>tag</b> system to monitor their use of feeders that were periodically moved around the colonies to assess exploratory behavior and sociality. During the same period, individuals’ reproductive success was monitored at the nest-boxes being used in this area. We found that our measures of sociality, wild, and captive exploration were repeatable, but contrary to our predictions, exploration in the novel environment test was not significantly correlated with exploration of feeders in the wild. We failed to find a predicted negative relationship between exploration and sociality, instead finding a significant positive correlation between exploration in the novel environment and sociality. Finally, we found little evidence that any of our measured personality traits influenced reproductive success at the colony, either individually or when the interactions between the personalities of both members of the pair were taken into account. The only exception was that highly exploratory males (assayed with wild feeder behavior) were more likely to make breeding attempts than less exploratory males. Our results suggest that researchers should use caution when using tests such as the classic novel environment test to make inferences about personality in wild populations. 12 page(s...|$|E

Two experiments were conducted in a laboratory stream to quantify benthic feeding success of salmonids across turbidity treatments ranging from 0 to 400 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). In one experiment, cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and coho salmon O. kisutch were offered the same nonliving prey in the drift and on the stream bottom; in the second experiment, cutthroat trout were offered only live oligochaetes moving along the stream bottom. In the first experiment, benthic feeding success of both cutthroat trout and coho salmon at 100 NTU was at least 70 % of their feeding performance in clear water (i. e., 0 NTU), whereas neither species fed at 400 NTU. In the second experiment, benthic feeding success of cutthroat trout at 150 NTU was about 35 % of their performance in clear water but dropped to near 0 % at 200 NTU; no feeding was observed at 400 NTU. Passive integrated <b>transponder</b> <b>tag</b> detections suggested that cutthroat trout activity increased over the range of 0 – 150 NTU. Although drift and benthic foraging success decreased over the examined turbidity range, the results sugges...|$|E
40|$|An active {{transponder}} system {{adapted for}} animal behaviour studies is described, {{and the potential}} of the system to facilitate patch scale monitoring of grazing cows is explored. A preliminary experiment examined the effect of presence and colour of loop aerial wires, on the activity of grazing cattle. Results from brown and white aerials pegged {{on the surface of the}} ground were compared with those from aerials buried at a depth of 5 cm. There was no effect of colour or burial of aerial on total number of contacts, or in time duration of cows within patches (P> 0. 001). Further experiments were conducted to examine potential sources of variation in the reading range of aerials. Reading range declined with reduction in aerial size and as the height of the transponder above ground level increased. Detection distance from a square aerial varied according to the transponder direction of approach, whereas direction of approach around the circumference of a circular aerial had little affect on detection distance. Reading range was greatest when orientation of the <b>transponder</b> <b>tag</b> to an aerial was vertical compared to horizontal. Implications of the results for studies of grazing activity are discussed and it is concluded that the field based active transponder system used in this experiment offers potential when recording patch level investigative behaviour of grazing animals. However, the effect of variability in reading range of aerials and potential variability in transponder height need to be considered when interpreting results from a field based active transponder system...|$|E
40|$|During {{the winter}} of 1995 and spring of 1996, the {{trapping}} facility in the fish ladder at Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River was modified to create a system that permits processing large numbers of adult fish while minimizing stress caused by handling. This was accomplished primarily by incorporating a gravity-flow dewatering system into the trap. Adults passing up the fish ladder can be sampled randomly or {{with the use of}} diversion systems that sample for coded wire or passive integrated <b>transponder</b> <b>tags.</b> About 13 % of the 1, 060, 059 adult Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss that passed through the facility from 1996 through 2001 were diverted for various research collections and observation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} an alternative method {{to track and}} identify utility poles used in transmission and distribution electrical power networks. The alternative method is based on radio frequency identification devices (RFID), in which electronic identification <b>transponder</b> <b>tags</b> were installed hidden inside the poles and the reading was done by a portable computer. Tests to prove {{the effectiveness of this}} technology were carried out in laboratory, before the chemical treatment process of the wooden pole, and in the energy line. The RFID showed a resistance to the autoclave treatment and a discrete look when in service. The RFID tags are an affordable and effective way to prevent the electrical energy interruption, by registering the time of service and the preservation condition of the pole...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} robotic security {{solution for}} outdoor storage facilities {{is provided by}} the Mobile Detection Assessment and Response System-Exterior (MDARS-E). The system consists of multiple supervised autonomous platforms equipped with intruder detection, barrier assessment, and inventory assessment subsystems commanded from an integrated control station. The exterior platform is only one component of the overall MDARS system, which supports a variety of remote resources including interior platforms and fixed-place security sensor suites. All such resources are controlled by the Multiple Resource Host Architecture (MRHA), with minimal human (i. e., security personnel) supervision required. In operation, the MRHA commands multiple exterior platforms to execute random patrols in the secured area, checking for intruders and interrogating barrier devices (i. e., door locks) and high-value assets equipped with radio frequency identification (RFID) <b>transponder</b> <b>tags.</b> The Intrusion Detection [...] ...|$|R
