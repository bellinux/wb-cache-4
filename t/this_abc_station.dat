50|$|WTXL has {{traditionally}} been a distant runner up in the ratings to longtime dominant WCTV. WTWC {{has never been a}} contender in the market because its two attempts to air local newscasts were both unsuccessful. The second news department operated by that station was ultimately shuttered due to poor viewership and budget cuts. Throughout the duration of the operational outsourcing agreement between WTXL and WTWC, <b>this</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>station</b> produced some limited newscast programming on WTWC.|$|E
50|$|KRXT is a Rockdale, Texas based radio station. It airs on 98.5 MHz and {{is under}} {{ownership}} of Charles W. McGregor (community radio, affiliated with <b>ABC).</b> <b>This</b> <b>station</b> airs a Country music format.|$|R
50|$|On November 16, 2009, KITV {{expanded}} its 10:00 p.m. newscast to one hour; KITV {{is one of}} a handful of <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> across the country that carries an hour-long late evening newscast. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>ABC's</b> late-night programming (currently Jimmy Kimmel Live) is broadcast at 11:00 p.m. On September 7, 2010, the station started Hawaii's only weekend morning newscast, from 6 to 8 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday mornings.|$|R
50|$|Thames {{is often}} quoted {{as a prime}} example of a good {{commercial}} public-service broadcaster with shows covering all aspects of the spectrum and the largest producer in the network. Its shows achieved massive audiences and are still remembered many years later. This is sometimes attributed to the culture of the company, which could be claimed to be a continuation of that at <b>ABC.</b> <b>This</b> <b>station</b> was more highly regarded by the ITA (amongst others) than Rediffusion whose programming was seen as downmarket and whose management-style was viewed as high-handed. The two companies allowed Thames independence (although in later years there were accusations that they both treated the company as a cash cow).|$|R

50|$|Since WEAR is {{the only}} major-network station {{licensed}} on the Florida side of the market, the station's newscasts tend {{to focus more on}} Pensacola. It does, however, operate a bureau on Dauphin Street in downtown Mobile. WEAR is one of several <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> across the country that carries an hour-long 10:00 p.m. newscast. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>ABC's</b> 10:35 programming (including Nightline and presently Jimmy Kimmel Live since the two shows switched timeslots nationally in January 2013) have always been broadcast on a half-hour tape delay and start at 11:00 p.m. The additional half-hour of the 10:00 p.m. broadcast began as Channel 3 News Extra, but has since evolved into an extension of the 10:00 p.m. newscast.|$|R

The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most <b>ABC</b> <b>stations,</b> although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the <b>ABC</b> <b>station,</b> it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately {{before the start of}} GMA.|$|R
50|$|KETV {{was one of}} many <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> that pre-empted {{the special}} showing of Saving Private Ryan in late 2004 due to {{concerns}} that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would impose a fine on them if they had aired the World War II-set movie due to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy earlier that year. The station, along with other Hearst-owned <b>ABC</b> affiliated <b>stations,</b> aired the 1992 film Far and Away instead; for the above reason, the program aired on all of the state's other <b>ABC</b> <b>stations,</b> and it was eventually determined that the movie's broadcast did not violate FCC regulations.|$|R
