5|$|Distraction {{displays}} {{attract the}} attention of predators away from an object, <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> nest or young, that is being protected.

5|$|The emperor's {{sisters and}} daughters were made either senior princesses, who {{shared the same}} rank as kings, or princesses, who shared the same rank as full marquesses; a princess's fief was <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> size of a county. The husband of a princess was ranked as a marquess. The daughters of kings were also princesses, but their fiefs were <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> smaller size of county districts, {{and could not be}} {{inherited}} by sons. Unlike the fiefs of kings and marquesses, the staffs of the princesses' fiefs answered directly to one of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> biggest {{part of the}} brain. Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.|$|E
5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. <b>Typically,</b> <b>the</b> headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
50|$|The term {{minister-president}} {{is rarely}} used in English; usually politicians holding titles that literally correspond to minister-president {{are referred to}} in English as premiers or first ministers (<b>typically</b> at <b>the</b> subnational level) or prime ministers (<b>typically</b> at <b>the</b> national level).|$|R

5|$|After 1948, the {{greatest}} impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and Yemen, and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa, particularly Morocco. <b>Typically,</b> <b>the</b> staff of army kitchens, schools, hospitals, hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi, Kurdish and Yemenite Jews, and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Unix File System, {{which is}} <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> default file system on BSDs, DragonFly BSD {{supports}} HAMMER file system.

HAMMER supports configurable file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication and other features typical for file systems of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Counselor: Counselors are {{required}} {{as part of}} the core team by Medicare regulations. <b>Typically,</b> <b>the</b> role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve.

The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Due to laxer laws about {{building}} housing on major roads, as London suburbs developed, properties {{were allowed to}} be built on the North Circular Road. The original purpose-built road had been designed with no speed limit, as was <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> case in the 1920s, but by 1951 a 30mph speed limit was enforced along the route.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (<b>typically</b> <b>the</b> high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. <b>Typically</b> <b>the</b> {{platelet count}} will fall 5â€“14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound {{that has been used}} in modern times as a recreational drug. <b>Typically,</b> <b>the</b> skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. <b>Typically,</b> <b>the</b> young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. <b>Typically</b> <b>the</b> woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E

5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry is <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E
5|$|No known {{globular}} clusters display active star formation, {{which is consistent}} with the view that {{globular clusters}} are <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|QPR's victory {{caused a}} problem for the Football Association as <b>typically</b> <b>the</b> League Cup winner would qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but one of the {{criteria}} for that competition was that the team must come from the highest tier of that country's league system.
