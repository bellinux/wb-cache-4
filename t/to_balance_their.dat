25|$|Hearts, {{like many}} other Scottish Premier League clubs, ran into severe {{financial}} difficulties during {{the early part of}} the 2000s.

Hearts also cut their player budget and, more significantly, proposed to sell Tynecastle to eradicate the club's debt.

25|$|Nystatin is a polyene {{antifungal}} drug {{to which}} many molds and yeast infections are sensitive.

Not only did it cure many serious fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract, but it could also be combined with antibacterial drugs <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> <b>their</b> side effects. Over the years, Nystatin proved effective not only in fighting human diseases, but was also used to stop fungal growth on flood-damaged works of art in Florence, Italy. It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm bark beetle.|$|E
25|$|Since Britain's {{victory over}} the Qing Empire in the First Opium War, British traders had sold large amounts of opium to the Chinese <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> <b>their</b> trade. Attitudes towards the {{morality}} of this business were slow to change, but in 1874 the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade was formed in England by Quakers led by the Rev. Frederick Storrs-Turner. By the 1890s, increasingly strident campaigns were waged by Protestant missionaries in China for its abolition. The first such society was established at the 1890 Shanghai Missionary Conference, where British and American representatives, including John Glasgow Kerr, Arthur E. Moule, Arthur Gostick Shorrock and Griffith John, agreed to establish the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies.|$|E
25|$|The new {{technologies}} introduced by Renault and Lotus became {{entangled in the}} FISA-FOCA war of the early 1980s. Turbo engines were complex machines whose layout limited the ground effect 'tunnels' under the car. They were an emerging technology {{and so they were}} difficult and expensive to develop and build and make reliable. It was mostly manufacturer-supported teams, such as Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo which took that route. In contrast, the cheap, reliable and narrow Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, still used by most teams more than a decade after its introduction, lent itself well to highly efficient ground effect aerodynamics. These two groups were represented by two political bodies – the sport's governing body FISA, headed by Jean-Marie Balestre; and FOCA, headed up by Bernie Ecclestone. The first group supported a strict limitation of ground effect to gain full advantage from their powerful turbos while the other relied on unrestricted ground effect <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> <b>their</b> horsepower deficit. There were also financial considerations. Faced with large constructors with unrestricted budgets, the smaller constructors wanted a larger share of Formula One's income to remain competitive.|$|E

25|$|Crocodiles {{have the}} most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV {{reported}} that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> <b>their</b> bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.|$|E

The race culminated in the orders for two armored cruisers for the Argentine Navy and two s for the Chilean Navy, though the latter two were purchased by the United Kingdom.
