5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E
5|$|Even before Aurangzeb died, Bahadur ShahI {{had made}} {{preparations}} for {{a battle for}} the Mughal throne. With the help of Munim Khan, the naib subahdar of Lahore, he gathered troops from local rulers in Beas and Satluj. He had built bridges and improved the roads between Lahore and Peshawar. He was also successful in persuading Rao Budh Singh (the king of Bundi) and Bijai Singh of Kachhwa to send <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> to him.|$|E
5|$|Tepić was {{considered}} a hero in Serbia because he preferred to die rather than surrender. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero by the Presidency of Yugoslavia on 19 November 1991, becoming the last recipient of the order.

5|$|The allied generals' dispatch, {{and other}} Parliamentarian accounts, stated that 300 of <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> were killed. One of those mortally wounded among the Parliamentarians was Sir Thomas Fairfax's brother, Charles. Another was Cromwell's nephew, Valentine Walton, who {{was struck by}} a {{cannonball}} early in the day. Cromwell was present when he died afterwards, and wrote a famous letter to the soldier's father, Cromwell's brother-in-law, also named Valentine Walton, which briefly described the battle and then informed the father of the son's last words and death.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} {{provoked a}} response from {{both sides in the}} conflict. U.S. commanders broadcast radio messages and dropped leaflets demanding the senior North Korean commanders be held responsible for the atrocity. The North Korean commanders, concerned about the way <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Memorials were later constructed on Hill 303 by troops at nearby Camp Carroll, to honor the victims of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Another document, {{this one}} {{preserved}} in an Irish memoranda roll {{dating to the}} reign of King Henry VI (reigned 1422–1461), records that after John's Irish expedition of 1210, Donnchadh controlled extensive territory in County Antrim, namely the settlements of Larne and Glenarm with 50 carucates of land in between, a territory similar to the later barony of Glenarm Upper. King John had given or recognised Donnchadh's possession of this territory, and that of Donnchadh's nephew Alaxandair (Alexander), {{as a reward for}} his help; similarly, John had given Donnchadh's cousins Ailean and Tómas, sons of Lochlann, a huge lordship equivalent to 140 knight's fees that included most of northern County Antrim and County Londonderry, the reward for use of <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> and galleys.|$|E

50|$|Between 1849 and 1947 the {{military}} {{history of the}} frontier was a succession of punitive expeditions against offending Pashtun (or Pathan) tribes, punctuated by three wars against Afghanistan.

60|$|It {{was a short}} notice, but by {{the time}} named the four aides-de-camp were in their saddles, as were <b>their</b> <b>soldier</b> servants, for by this time Desmond's two friends had {{obtained}} servants from a dragoon regiment. They were but just in time, for they had scarcely mounted when the duke came out, sprang into his saddle, and went off at a canter.|$|R
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{share of}} the Empire {{consisted}} of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded {{one of the largest}} Roman armies, stationed along the important Rhine frontier. After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, driving back the tribes of the Picts and secured his control in the northwestern dioceses. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways. He soon left for Augusta Treverorum (Trier) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire. The Franks, after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–307AD. Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> were fed to the beasts of Trier's amphitheater in the adventus (arrival) celebrations that followed.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{minister}} of war Matías de Irigoyen ordered once more {{the return of the}} Army of the Andes, and appointed Francisco Fernández de la Cruz as its leader, displacing San Martín. San Martín resigned again, and observed that the Army {{would not be able to}} cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter snow was blocking the trails. All the leaders of the military units of the Army of the Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> would mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Martín and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the Army of the Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1819, Pueyrredón ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by José Rondeau.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{soldiers}} marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating {{pockets of}} Chinese resistance. By December 9 {{they had reached}} {{the last line of}} defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay Nanking's fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> often casting off their weapons and uniforms in the streets in the hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{then set}} out to follow Warwick, first earning {{the respect of the}} Great Plains tribes by good deeds and helping to defend them against Warwick's forces, then they {{intercept}} Warwick's supply train and destroy a fortified Circle base in the mountains. They soon discover that Warwick and his soldiers have fled even farther west, to act as a checkpoint at Alaska, where they notice the Circle's new ally, the Russians. They realize that the Circle plans to capture British and French colonies and towns while <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> are at war with one another, and that Warwick wants the Circle of Ossus as the new leader of the New World.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for <b>their</b> <b>soldiers,</b> so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E

They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting {{on behalf of}} the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed <b>their</b> <b>soldiers.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of <b>their</b> <b>soldiers</b> and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E
