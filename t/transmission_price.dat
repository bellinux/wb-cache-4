40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a conjectured supply function (CSF) equilibrium models of oligopolistic competition among electricity producers formulated as mixed linear complementarity problems (MLCP). Similar to the conjectured supply function approach, a conjectured <b>transmission</b> <b>price</b> (CTP) response function is formulated {{in order to}} model how generating companies can influence the <b>transmission</b> <b>price.</b> The model simulates a bilateral market design based on a point-to-point transmission pricing scheme corresponding to the locational marginal pricing (LMP) based congestion management. The focus {{of this paper is}} to study the outcome of the market equilibrium by a stepwise increase of each strategic generator’s CTP response parameter. An estimation of this parameter will not be within the scope of this paper. The results show that strategic generators behave more profitably when they have some information about how to affect transmission prices. However, depending on where they are located with respect to the congested transmission line, they pursue different policies in terms of manipulating congestion prices. A three-node network is presented to illustrate the application.

40|$|Abstract — In network-constrained {{electricity}} market {{models of}} oligopolistic competition among power producers, strategically behaving generators {{are likely to}} manipulate prices in the energy and transmission market {{in order to gain}} higher profits. As for the energy market, several game theoretical approaches have been applied to represent strategic generators ’ behavior. Another approach is used in this paper which needs external sensitivity parameters to be estimated known as Conjectural Variations (CV). Additionally, the strategic generators ’ effect on transmission prices is taken into account by means of introducing Conjectured <b>Transmission</b> <b>Price</b> Response (CTPR) parameters. An estimation procedure of the CV- and CTPR- parameters will be within the scope of this paper. The results will show that a more accurate market outcome can be achieved when additionally accounting for strategic behavior in the transmission market. The overall market design forms an equilibrium model of bilateral trading with perfect arbitrage based on a point-topoint transmission pricing scheme and is formulated as a mixed linear complementarity (MLCP) problem.

The main idea is voltage angle allocation, i. e. determining the contribution of each contract on the voltage angle of each bus. DC power flow is used to compute a primary solution for angle decomposition. To consider the impacts of system non-linearity on angle decomposition, the primary solution is corrected in different iterations of decoupled Newton-Raphson power flow. Then, the contribution of each contract on power flow of each transmission line is computed based on angle decomposition. Contract-related flows are used as a measure for “extent of use ” of transmission network capacity and consequently <b>transmission</b> <b>pricing.</b> The presented approach is applied to a 4 -bus test system and IEEE 30 -bus test system.

40|$|Abstract—The conjectured <b>transmission</b> <b>price</b> {{response}} model {{presented in}} the first of this two paper series considers the expectations of oligopolistic generators regarding how demands for transmission services affect the prices of those services. Here, the model is applied to northwest Europe, simulating a mixed transmission pricing system including export fees, a path-based auction system for between-country interfaces, and implicit congestion-based pricing of internal country constraints. The pathbased system does not give credit for counterflows when calculating export capability. The application shows that this no-netting policy can exacerbate the economic inefficiencies caused by oligopolistic pricing by generators. The application also illustrates the effects of different generator conjectures regarding rival supply responses and transmission prices. If generators anticipate that their increased demand for transmission services will increase transmission prices, then competitive intensity diminishes and energy prices rise. In the example here, the effect of this anticipation is to double the price increase that results from oligopolistic (Cournot) competition among generators...|$|E

In addition, the crisis of September 11, while raising questions about the future of our energy policy, shouid have no bearing on the continuation of restructuring.
