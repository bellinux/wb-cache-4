5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it {{as some kind of}} victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E
5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> the aircraft. It {{received a call}} from a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E

5|$|Dumouriez {{thought his}} soldiers' morale was too shaky for a retreat so he {{advanced}} on Coburg's army, seeking battle. In his haste, the French commander failed <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> Harville's corps or the Army of Holland as reinforcements. Earlier, François Joseph Drouot de Lamarche {{had been driven}} out of Tienen (Tirlemont), but on 16 March the French recaptured it after a vigorous combat. The French attacked Tienen with 10,000 troops while Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen defended the town with 6,000 soldiers, six guns and two mortars. French casualties numbered 500 while their opponents sustained losses of 800 killed, wounded and missing. Coburg pulled his army back behind the Little Gete River. Believing that he outnumbered his enemies, Dumouriez was very confident of success. A century before, the French had won the Battle of Landen on the same ground.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{set up a}} Defence Committee {{within the}} Cabinet to {{co-ordinate}} the colony's war effort in early 1940. This body comprised the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister Jacob Smit, Tredgold and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest, the Minister of Mines and Public Works, who {{was put in charge}} of the new Air Ministry. About 1,600 of the colony's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when, during the Battle of France, Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and a half and 25 who had lived in the colony for at least six months. The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942. Part-time training was compulsory for all white males between 18 and 55, with a small number of exceptions for those in reserved occupations. On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia, the last country to join the EATS, became the first to start operating an air school under it, beating Canada by a week. The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, with No.1 Squadron becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons, namely No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron (in 1940) and No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron (1941), {{in a manner similar to}} the Article XV squadrons from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} famous of all his {{international}} caps came in a match in Glasgow against Scotland in October 1930, in which a depleted Welsh side, unable <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> many of their star players as Football League clubs refused to release them for international duty, became known as 'Keenor and the 10 unknowns'. Ted Robbin's side, playing on a Saturday when the English leagues had a full programme, {{had no choice but to}} play 10 players from either the lower divisions, Welsh League sides or from the non-leagues. The Welsh featured just seven players from Football League sides, with only Keenor and Cardiff teammates Len Evans and Walter Robbins playing in the top two divisions, 3 players from Welsh league sides Cardiff Corinthians, Llanelli and Colwyn Bay and one player from non-league side Oswestry Town. The side featured nine debutants in the line-up, Keenor and Cardiff teammate Len Evans being the only two with previous experience at international level. Wales had previously been forced into a similar situation eight months earlier, in February 1930, when Keenor had played in a severely weakened side that had lost 7–0 to Ireland, Joe Bambrick scoring six times in the game, describing the match as the worst game he had ever played.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in the series, England made a change to their side – Simon Jones' ankle injury meant that England needed to replace him.

Nonetheless, the House resolution passed the Senate in a 40–2 vote, marking {{the beginning of}} the Mexican-American War. Many would-be opponents of the war feared that opposition would cost them politically by casting themselves as unpatriotic for not supporting the war effort.|$|E

They quickly captured several villages, but bad weather conditions and an inability <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>up</b> reinforcements stalled the government offensive. A few days later, the rebels launched a counter-offensive, retaking two of four positions they had lost to Syrian government forces.|$|E
