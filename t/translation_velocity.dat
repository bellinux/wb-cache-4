40|$|The {{modification}} of the axisymmetric viscous flow due to relative rotation of the disk or fluid by a translation of the boundary is studied. The fluid is taken to be compressible, and the relative rotation and <b>translation</b> <b>velocity</b> of the disk or fluid are time-dependent. The nonlinear partial differential equations governing the motion are solved numerically using an implicit finite difference scheme and Newton's linearisation technique. Numerical solutions are obtained at various non-dimensional times and disk temperatures. The non-symmetric part of the flow (secondary flow) describing the translation effect generates a velocity field at each plane parallel to the disk. The cartesian components of velocity due to secondary flow exhibit oscillations when the motion is due to rotation of the fluid on a translating disk.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is derived to efficiently describe the wave energy distribution {{along the main}} transects of a moving extreme weather event. The model essentially builds on a generalization of the self-similar wave growth model and the assumption of a strongly dominant single spectral mode in a given quadrant of the storm. The criterion to anticipate wave enhancement with the generation of trapped abnormal waves defined as inline image, with inline image, inline image, and inline image, radial distance, average sustained wind speed, and <b>translation</b> <b>velocity,</b> respectively. Constants inline image and inline image follow the fetch-law definitions. If forced during a sufficient time scale interval, also defined from this generalized self-similar wave growth model, waves can be trapped and large amplification of the wave energy will occur in the front-right storm quadrant. Remarkably, the group velocity and corresponding wavelength of outrunning wave systems will become wind speed independent and solely related to the translating velocity. The resulting significant wave height also only weakly depends on wind speed, and more strongly on the <b>translation</b> <b>velocity.</b> Compared to altimeter satellite measurements, the proposed analytical solutions for the wave energy distribution demonstrate convincing agreement. As analytically developed, the wave enhancement criterion can provide a rapid evaluation to document the general characteristics of each storm, especially the expected wavefield asymmetry...|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{bilateral}} vestibular loss {{have difficulty}} maintaining balance without stepping when standing in tandem, on compliant surfaces, across narrow beams, or on one foot, especially with eyes closed. Normal individuals (with no sensory impairment) maintain balance in these tasks by employing quick, active hip rotation (a "hip strategy"). The {{absence of a}} hip strategy in vestibular patients responding to translations of a short support surface has previously been taken {{as evidence that the}} use of hip strategy requires an intact vestibular system. However, many tasks requiring hip strategy alter one or a combination of important system characteristics, such as initial state of the body (tandem stance), dynamics (compliant surfaces), or biomechanical limits of stability (narrow beams). Therefore, the balance deficit in these tasks may result from a failure to account for these support surface alterations when planning and executing sensorimotor responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that vestibular information is critical to trigger a hip strategy even on an unaltered support surface, which imposes no changes on the system characteristics. We recorded the postural responses of vestibular patients and control subjects with eyes closed to rearward support surface <b>translations</b> of varying <b>velocity,</b> in erect stance on a firm, flat surface. Subjects were instructed to maintain balance without stepping, if possible. Faster <b>translation</b> <b>velocities</b> (25 cm/s or more) produced a consistent pattern of early hip torque (first 400 ms) in control subjects (i. e., a hip strategy). Most of the patients with bilateral vestibular loss responded to the same <b>translation</b> <b>velocities</b> with similar torques. Contrary to our hypothesis, we conclude that vestibular function is not necessary to trigger a hip strategy. We postulate, therefore, that the balance deficit previously observed in vestibular patients during postural tasks that elicit a hip strategy may have been due to the sensorimotor consequences of the system alterations imposed by the postural tasks used in those studies. Preliminary results from two younger patients who lost vestibular function as infants indicate that age, duration of vestibular loss, and/or the timing of the loss may also be factors that can influence the use of hip strategy as a rapid postural response...|$|R

The structure and <b>translation</b> <b>velocities</b> of modons are discussed in terms of the asymptotic expansion in which the background density ratio approaches unity.

40|$|Movement {{over the}} surface of the {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) disc produces tractional forces. These forces potentially increase the magnitude of shear stresses and contribute to wear and fatigue of the disc. Theoretically, tractional forces in all synovial joints are the result of frictional forces, due to rubbing of the cartilage surfaces, and plowing forces, due to translation of the stress-field through the cartilage matrix as the joint surface congruency changes during motion. For plowing forces to occur in the TMJ, there must be mediolateral translation of the stress-field as the condyle moves dorsoventrally during jaw function. To test whether mediolateral stress-field translation occurs in the intact TMJ, we measured stress-field position and translation velocities in ten normal individuals during rhythmic jaw opening and closing. Magnetic resonance imaging and jaw tracking were combined to animate the three-dimensional position of the stress-field between the articulating surfaces. This allowed for mediolateral <b>translation</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements of the centroid of the stress-field. The results showed that during jaw opening and closing at 0. 5 Hz, the average peak mediolateral <b>translation</b> <b>velocity</b> was 35 +/- 17 mm/sec. When opening and closing increased to 1. 0 Hz, the average peak velocity was 40 +/- 19 mm/sec. Theoretical model estimates of the work done during such translation ranged from 6 to 709 mJ between the individual joints studied. The potential clinical importance of this measure is that long-term exposure of the TMJ disc to high work may result in fatigue failure of the TMJ disc...|$|E

By analyzing an idealized version of the network with broader, sinusoidal direction-tuning and linear speed-tuning, we show analytically that a Hebb rule trained with arbitrary rotation, dilatiodcontraction, and <b>translation</b> <b>velocity</b> fields yields units with weight fields that are a rotation plus a dilation or contraction field, and whose responses to a rotating or dilatinglcontracting disk are exactly position independent. Differences between the performance of this idealized model and our original model (and real MST neurons) are discussed. ...|$|E

A parallel-serial surgical robot has been developed, named D'cros by the authors for such applications. This paper introduces the motion control of the robot and its control simulation. In motion control, we describe the structure of the robot and propose three angles defining the end-effector's orientation in 3 D space and two Cartesian coordinates, one of which is for surgeons to input the end-effector's positions and define its orientations and the other is used to control motors for end-effector's movement.

40|$|We use {{high-speed}} video imaging {{to study}} the capillary-driven motion of a micro-droplet along the outside of a pre-wetted conical fiber. The cones are fabricated on a glass-puller with tip diameters as small as 1 μm, {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than in previous studies. The liquid is fed through the hollow fiber accumulating at the fiber tip to form droplets. The droplets are initially attached to the opening as they grow in size before detaching and traveling up the cone. This detachment can produce a transient oscillation of high frequency. The spatial variation of the capillary pressure drives the droplets towards the wider side of the cone. Various liquids were used to change the surface tension by a factor of 3. 5 and viscosity by a factor of 1500. Within each droplet size and viscous-dissipation regime, the data for climbing speeds collapse on a single curve. Droplets traveling with and against gravity allow us to pinpoint the absolute strength of the driving capillary pressure and viscous stresses and thereby determine the prefactors in the dimensionless relationships. The motions are consistent with earlier results obtained from much larger cones. <b>Translation</b> <b>velocities</b> up to 270 mm/s were observed and overall the velocities follow capillary-viscous scaling, whereas the speed of the fastest droplets is limited by inertia following their emergence at the cone tip...|$|R

40|$|Most {{insects are}} thought to fly by {{creating}} a leading-edge vortex that remains attached to the wing as it translates through a stroke. In the species examined so far, stroke amplitude is large, {{and most of the}} aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when <b>translation</b> <b>velocities</b> are highest. Here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy, hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude (≈ 90 °) and high wingbeat frequency (≈ 230 Hz). When measured on a dynamically scaled robot, the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning, middle, and end of each stroke, indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal. When challenged to fly in low-density heliox, bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly 50 %. We examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in 5 ° increments. To separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude, we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions. The results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power. We suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles...|$|R

We report the radial distribution functions of like and unlike molecules and conclude that, even at large distances, these molecules are spatially correlated (with respect to their centers of mass). This behavior is interpreted as an indication that urea molecules are not uniformly distributed at a microscopic level. However, the orientational distribution shows that, at long distances, the urea molecules are not orientationally correlated. A strong correlation between urea molecules is observed within the first-shells of neighboring molecules. In view of these results, it is postulated that urea behaves slightly like a nonpolar molecule.

40|$|It has not {{hitherto}} {{been possible}} to establish whether the appearance of noctilucent clouds is due to an increased concentration or locally increased size of solid particles at the mesopause, or {{to a combination of}} these mechanisms. In this contribution the possibility of a relationship between the optical characteristics of noctilucent clouds and ice sublimation is discussed on the basis of present-day knowledge of the structure and photochemistry of the mesosphere. The first part is devoted to a discussion of the character of the sublimation process at these altitudes. It is found that such a process is possible in conditions prevailing at the high-latitude summer mesopause. The time scale of sublimation and evaporation is slow compared with horizontal <b>translation</b> <b>velocities</b> observed in this region. Below the mesopause evaporation becomes rapid compared with the settling speed of sub-micron particles. In the second part the scattering properties of monodisperse and polydisperse particle distributions, and the possible changes following a sublimation process are reviewed on the basis of numerical computations of scattering functions of coated spherical particles. It is found that the optical consequences of sublimation depend critically upon the presence and relative concentration of particles obeying the Rayleigh scatter-ing law in the visible spectrum. The characteristic time scale of brightness changes by sublimation is at least 10 to 100 minutes.

40|$|Dust devils {{are likely}} the {{dominant}} source of dust for the martian atmosphere, {{but the amount}} and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a distribution of likely <b>translation</b> <b>velocities,</b> and {{the recovery of the}} underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.
