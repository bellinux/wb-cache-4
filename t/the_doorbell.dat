5|$|The {{story begins}} with Aya {{returning}} home from a rough day at work. After relaxing on her bed, she receives {{a phone call from}} her father, who wants to have dinner with her; however, she declines by lying about still being at work. The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance between her and her father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience that brings the two closer together. Aya later visits her father to see the new kitten he buys. At the same time, her mother rings <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> and the family is reunited, their happiness renewed.|$|E
25|$|The name {{may also}} be used for a {{character}} who never delivers a line, and thus any member of the stage crew might be filling in the role. For example, a person makes a delivery to a character onstage: <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> rings, the delivery is made, and the delivery carrier disappears, with no words spoken.|$|E
25|$|Stout {{was one of}} many American writers {{closely watched}} by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Hoover {{considered}} him an enemy of the bureau and either a Communist or a tool of Communist-dominated groups. Stout's leadership of the Authors League of America during the McCarthy era was particularly irksome to the FBI. About a third of Stout's FBI file is devoted to his 1965 novel <b>The</b> <b>Doorbell</b> Rang.|$|E

50|$|Alarming {{concerns}} regarding {{the security of}} <b>the</b> smart <b>doorbells</b> have been raised. Researchers at Pen Test Partners in the UK have analyzed <b>the</b> Ring smart <b>doorbell</b> and concluded that it's possible for an attacker {{to gain access to}} the homeowner’s wireless network by unscrewing the Ring, pressing the setup button and accessing the configuration URL.

25|$|In 1977, Paramount Television filmed Nero Wolfe, an {{adaptation}} of Stout's novel <b>The</b> <b>Doorbell</b> Rang.

Nero Wolfe was finally broadcast December 18, 1979, as an ABC-TV late show.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Vollmer — {{a medical}} doctor who is Wolfe's {{neighbor}} and friend. Wolfe calls upon Vollmer whenever a dead body is discovered, or medical attention is required, at the brownstone. In The Silent Speaker, Vollmer contrives an illness severe enough that Wolfe cannot be questioned or even seen by anyone. Vollmer examines Louis Rony's corpse for Wolfe in The Second Confession and acts as a go-between for Cramer and Archie in <b>The</b> <b>Doorbell</b> Rang. Vollmer's motivation, aside from friendship, is that Wolfe helped him out with a would-be blackmailer years ago.|$|E

Micky, having warmed to Arabella, and moved by Paige's story of her accident, not to mention fear of his getting hurt too when Rudi returns, offers to take Arabella home in Rudi's favourite car, thereby setting Paige free. Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her. They leave together, and the play ends just as Rudi's gangsters are trying to force their way through the door to a surprised Derek and Dee.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the center}} from which moral order emanates, and the details of its layout and its {{operations}} are signs of its stability. For forty years, Wolfe prepares menus with Fritz and pots orchids with Theodore.

For forty years, Inspector Cramer and Sergeant Purley Stebbins ring <b>the</b> <b>doorbell,</b> enter the office, and explode with indignation at Wolfe's intractability. The front room, the elevator, the three-foot globe — all persist in place through forty years of American history. … Like Holmes's 221B Baker Street, Wolfe's West Thirty-Fifth Street remains a fixed point in a turning world.|$|E

Bart and Milhouse find Fat Tony and his henchmen, but when Tony realizes that Bart has a wire he chases the boys through the sewers until they emerge where Marge and Lisa are.

The police believe that she and two other victims were killed between this time and 8:00AM, which was the moment at which Mrs Haroková's wristwatch stopped. A post woman arrived at the door shortly before nine. <b>The</b> <b>doorbell</b> was answered by Dahlgren, who accepted the mail. Two hours later, a cleaner came to the house, but was sent away by Dahlgren immediately after entering the hallway.

500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her.

[...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any {{cleaning}} products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone."

500|$|When Homer {{turns on}} the truck radio, the song [...] "Wannabe" [...] by the Spice Girls can be heard. Originally, a [...] "trucker song" [...] about [...] "a horrible wreck out on old 95" [...] would be heard. The song was a {{reference}} to the [...] "Wreck of the Old 97", a famous locomotive that crashed in 1903 and inspired the country ballad of the same name. It was sung by main cast member Dan Castellaneta, included mentions of [...] "scraping blood and guts off the road" [...] and was eventually dropped because it was considered too gruesome by the staff. The song was later included as a deleted scene on The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set. While eating dinner at Joe's Diner, [...] "12 Bar Blues" [...] by NRBQ (a band that Mike Scully was fond of) can be heard playing from a jukebox. According to producer Ian Maxtone-Graham, <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> tune in the episode [...] "has a history with The Simpsons", as it is also Homer and Marge's wedding song. [...] "Maximum Homerdrive" [...] features the first appearance of Señor Ding-Dong, who is a recurring character in the series. He is portrayed by Castellaneta, the voice behind many characters. Red Barclay, the trucker who dies of [...] "beef poisoning" [...] in The Slaughterhouse, was portrayed by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who voices many characters in the series. Barclay's voice is slightly based on that of American actor Gary Busey. The two Jehovah's witnesses were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Karl Wiedergott.|$|E
500|$|Dostoyevsky {{began working}} on Poor Folk in early 1844. He first {{mentioned}} the upcoming work {{in a letter to}} Mikhail on 30 September 1844: [...] "I am finishing up a novel of the size of Eugénie Grandet. It's a rather original work." [...] Dostoyevsky later wrote to his brother on 23 March 1845, [...] "I finished the novel in November, then rewrote it in December, and again in February–March. I am seriously satisfied with my novel. It is a serious and elegant work..." [...] Sometime around April 1845, his friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he had shared an apartment since the autumn of 1844, proposed giving the manuscript to poet Nikolay Nekrasov, who was planning to issue an anthology in 1846. Dostoyevsky took the manuscript to Nekrasov and returned home. Shortly afterwards <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> of his house rang, and he {{opened the door to the}} excited Nekrasov and Grigorovich, both of whom congratulated him on his debut novel, of which they had only read 10 pages. They finished the full 112-page work during the night at Dostoyevsky's apartment. The next morning, the three men went to the critic Vissarion Belinsky; Nekrasov proclaimed Dostoyevsky [...] "the New Gogol" [...] though Belinsky replied sceptically [...] "You find Gogol's springing up like mushrooms". Dostoyevsky himself did not believe his book would receive a positive review from Belinsky, but when Nekrasov visited Belinsky in the evening, the latter wanted to meet Dostoyevsky to congratulate him on his debut. Dostoyevsky proposed to issue Poor Folk in the Fatherland Notes, but it was instead published in the almanac St. Petersburg Collection on January 15, 1846.|$|E

Ground-floor apartments all have a small garden and garden shed, while upper-floor apartments have an attic. All apartments have modern conveniences such as television and running water.

Mason manipulates evidence and witnesses, resulting in the acquittal of the murderer in The Case of the Howling Dog (1934).
