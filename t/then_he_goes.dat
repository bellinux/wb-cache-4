5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E

Before leaving for this final test, Sir Eglamour asks for twelve weeks to recuperate and the earl’s noblemen support {{him in this}} request, so it is granted. During this time, Sir Eglamour gives Christabel a child. He also gives her the magic ring that Organate of Sidon gave to him. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> off to Rome, where the dragon is soon lying dead at his feet.

25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E

It states: [...] "Turner, a man of bad character, conducts an inn in the country. His stepdaughter Grace is his trudge. When on an errand to the village she meets Jack, wealthy young man. He is much attracted by her. Jack goes to the bank and draws a large sum of money. Hank, a pal of Turner, sees him and tries to ambush him on the road, but fails. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> ahead to tell Turner. Jack, on his trip, meets Grace. Nearly exhausted, he takes her home, and thus seems to play directly {{into the hands of the}} villains. They steal his revolver, and would drug him, were it not for the fact that Grace writes a warning on the wall with wine. Jack, aided by Grace, escapes but the girl is wounded. Jack marries Grace." ...|$|E

About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance.

[...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E
500|$|Biographer David Henderson {{describes}} Hendrix's guitar tone as [...] "at {{the razor}} edge of distort". [...] However, individual notes are still clear, {{as well as}} the harmonically more complex chords, even with the use of extreme overdrive for the time. [...] The tension is maintained until the guitar solo, which [...] "arrives as something of a release rather than a further racking up of the atmosphere." [...] It is also when Hendrix first introduces the Octavia, coupled with a Fuzz Face distortion unit. [...] Whitehill describes the solo as [...] "almost sound likes he's playing a blues raga. [...] He starts out playing in the Mixolydian mode and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> right into the blues side. [...] The Octavia has the effect of a sitar, kind of like Ravi Shankar meets B.B. King." [...] During the song's outro, the guitar part recorded at 7½ inches per second (ips) played back at 15 ips, is combined with the Octavia, further extending the guitar's upper frequency range. [...] Henderson describes it as [...] "an uncanny piercing tone that takes off, Eastern-sounding beyond the range of the guitar" [...] and, according to Shadwick, [...] "gives the impression that the guitar notes are flying off into the ether." ...|$|E

500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it.

So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording.

And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album.

500|$|Parasakthi {{received}} critical acclaim. P. Balasubramania Mudaliar of Sunday Observer wrote, [...] "The {{story is}} simple {{but it has}} been made powerful by Mr. Karunanidhi by his beautiful dialogues. Mr. Shivaji Ganesan, who plays the main role dominates from the beginning to the end" [...] and concluded, [...] "If an Academy award were to be given to any picture, I have little doubt that this picture would be entitled on its merits to such an award." [...] Dinamani Kadir, a Tamil weekly owned by Indian Express Limited (then known as The Indian Express Group), carried an unusually long review of Parasakthi running into three closely printed pages. The review was given a cynical title, [...] "Kandarva Mandalam" [...] ("The Abode of Kandarvas") and it began with a small box-item which read, [...] "Parasakthi: This goddess is abused in a Tamil film with her name". The reviewer opined, [...] "The main aim of the film is to attach gods. Along with that, the government and society are overtly and covertly attacked. The embittered and agitated reviewer further claimed, [...] "He , acting as a mad man, threatens and beats the people on the street and grabs whatever they have and eats it. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> to give repeatedly all those economics lectures, rationalist lectures and anti-god lectures. When we see the hero doing all that, it seems as if he is portraying the lives of those who are trying to force such ideas in the ...film." [...] For the reviewer, thus, the DMK men were living on others' sweat and preaching unacceptable subsersive ideas. The magazine Sivaji praised the dialogues written by Karunanidhi, and the performances of Ganesan and Sahasranamam.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} about {{a little boy who}} leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things she wanted him to buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E

2500|$|This corrupts {{the bottom}} of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with {{seemingly}} random symbols and tiles, overwriting the values of edible dots which makes it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this [...] "split-screen" [...] level is often referred to as the [...] "kill screen". There are 114 dots on the left half of the screen, nine dots on the right, and one bonus key, totaling 6,310 points. When all of the dots have been cleared, nothing happens. The game does not consider a level to be completed until 244 dots have been eaten. Each time a life is lost, the nine dots on the right half of the screen get reset and can be eaten again, resulting in an additional 90 points per extra man. In the best-case scenario (five extra men), 6,760 points will be the maximum score possible, but only 168 dots can be harvested, and that is not enough to change levels. Four of the nine dots on the right half of the screen are invisible, but can be heard when eaten. [...] Some dots are invisible but the rest can be seen, although some are a different color from normal. One method for safely clearing this round is to trap the ghosts. To trap the three important ghosts, the player must begin by going right until Pac-man reaches a blue letter 'N', and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> down. He keeps going down until he reaches a blue letter 'F' and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> right. He keeps going right until he reaches a yellow 'B', and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> down again. When executed properly, Pac-Man will hit an invisible wall almost immediately after the last turn is made. Eventually, the red ghost will get stuck. The pink ghost follows a few seconds later. The blue ghost will continue to move freely for several moments until the next scatter mode occurs. At that point, it will try to reach some location near the right edge of the screen and get stuck with the pink and red ghost instead. The orange ghost is the only one still on the loose, but he is no real threat since he runs to his corner whenever Pac-Man gets close so that it is easy to eat all the dots. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen if this 256th level is cleared: the fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.|$|E
