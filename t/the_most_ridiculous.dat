Though he lived happily, one event embittered Lesage for years. His eldest son had been educated for the bar, but insisted going on stage. Lesage, who had often painted {{the life of the}} actor in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> and hateful aspect, was pained by his son's career choice, especially when his son joined the Théâtre Français, against which Lesage had long waged a satirical war. Probably out of deference to his father, the son took the name Montménil, and by the merit of his talents and private character, soon entered the upper society of Paris. Lesage was reconciled with his son many years later and became so devoted to Montménil that he could barely leave his side.|$|E
500|$|Counter to Campbell, Potter {{seems to}} emphasise how gender is removed and emphasises that Fielding sees gender {{as a social}} construct. There is a {{balancing}} of the genders and neither is favoured over the other. To Potter, [...] "Only the weakening of humanity through cross-adoption of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> qualities of either gender is attacked in Fielding's plays." ...|$|E

He remembers the game as [...] "very [...] " [...] and wrote it to be [...] "a glass half full kind of game". When asked of his favorite contribution to the final work, Lindblom remembered the character Pokey's mother, Lardna. He described the name choice as [...] "just <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> thing to have picked". Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan, an original reviewer, wrote that EarthBound was translated [...] "impeccably" [...] and praised the game's humor. In the period following its release, the game's English localization has found praise. Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as [...] "top-notch for its time". Kotaku found the localization [...] "funny, clever, and evocative".|$|E

500|$|Peterborough's Director of {{football}} Barry Fry criticised Nottingham Forest's owners for {{pulling out of}} the deal to sign Boyd, and chairman MacAnthony said, [...] "I'm devastated for George. I got a phone call off him in bits... He said that he passed the medical then they made him do an eye test. He's played 300 matches and scored from the halfway line the other month, but Forest say he has an eyesight problem. The whole thing stinks. Alex McLeish wanted to sign him. It's <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> thing that's happened to me." [...] Peterborough subsequently said that with Boyd's contract expiring in the summer, they would be prepared to offer him a new contract or let him leave on loan when the emergency loan window opened, with at least one club having signalled their interest in doing so.|$|E
500|$|Ice's {{second major}} release was the live album Extremely Live, {{released}} in March 1991. The album was a live recording during Vanilla Ice's performance in Miami during his To The Extreme tour. Premiering new songs like Rollin' in My 5.0, Road To My Riches and Satisfaction, the album peaked at #30 on the Billboard 200, but it received mainly negative reviews, with Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne calling it [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> albums ever released", {{comparing it to}} The Best of Marcel Marceau, an album which consisted of two sides of silence opened by brief applause. According to Browne, Extremely Live [...] "affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter [...] and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing." [...] Monte Lipman later stated that SBK only released the live disc {{to make more money}} from Ice's fame. In April 1991, Ice began to film the SBK produced Cool as Ice, in which he played a leading role.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club [...] Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C, {{comparing it to}} the first act of Shaffer's Equus. VanDerWerff described the episode as [...] "a bland, boring mess that ends with one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> deux ex machinas [...] I’ve seen in ages", and felt that [...] "the guest cast is uniformly poor", singling out Van Quattro as being [...] "laughably bad". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3 out of 5, calling it [...] " [...] enthralling" [...] but [...] "not completely successful". Gibron felt that elements of the setting were [...] "very sinister", but found the [...] "overwhelming pro-horse mantras" [...] of some characters to be [...] "silly". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Broken World" [...] three stars out of five, finding it [...] "too familiar and too tentative to make much impact". Shearman felt that the episode {{would have been better}} placed earlier in the series' broadcast order, but by this stage in the first season it had been [...] "outgrown".|$|E

500|$|The Daily Stormer orchestrates what {{it calls}} a [...] "Troll Army", {{involved}} in Internet trolling. It came to attention in October 2014 in a campaign against British Labour politician Luciana Berger, a Jewish Member of Parliament. A member of neo-Nazi group National Action {{had been sent to}} prison for sending her abusive messages over Twitter and The Daily Stormer encouraged its readers to send her antisemitic messages, as long as they did not promote violence. It also gave out guidelines on how to limit traceability and create anonymous e-mail and Twitter accounts. Berger said she received 400 abusive messages in one week. The abuse was brought up in the British Parliament, where Speaker John Bercow deemed it [...] "beneath contempt". The Troll Army launched a campaign in February 2015 against Mariam Veiszadeh, an Afghan Australian Muslim activist who demanded that a T-shirt bearing the Australian flag reading [...] "If you don't love it, leave" [...] be withdrawn from sale at Woolworths. [...] A woman was arrested for sending her abusive messages, and Anglin interpreted Veiszadeh's actions as curbing freedom of speech, which he believed [...] "should be responded to with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> conceivable hateful speech".|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{commented that}} the [...] "menacing rhythm and chanted vocals" [...] on [...] "Diva", mark the album's biggest departure. Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times felt that the song was {{influenced}} by Beyoncé's husband, American rapper Jay-Z as it has a [...] "bad soft-core gangster rap". He also noted that its contains words that could get an [...] "explicit" [...] sticker by the chain stores. Similarly, Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix remarked that the song is [...] "particularly intriguing" [...] as it progresses through [...] "hard-knockish robbery scenarios" [...] which does not resemble Beyoncé's clean public image. Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine noted that [...] "Diva" [...] places a [...] "startling, sexy snarl over window-rattling bass". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted Beyoncé turns out [...] "modal-sounding hooks" [...] over 808 bass on the song. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described Sasha Fierce as [...] "suffer no such identity crisis, brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty...", reflected on [...] "Diva". James Reed of The Boston Globe described [...] "Diva" [...] as a [...] "glitchy, bass-heavy thumper with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> chorus of the year". Reed nevertheless added that the song is [...] "insanely catchy, but then, when you hear something looped incessantly, no matter how mindless, it's bound to stick".|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Omega taking over Bullet Club's leadership, he and The Young Bucks formed their own subgroup within the stable, called [...] "The Elite". Omega and The Young Bucks {{came up with the}} idea for The Elite themselves, feeling the need to create something new after being forced by NJPW into Bullet Club and what Omega called a [...] "Too Sweet", [...] "Suck it" [...] parody of the nWo. Omega stated that he and The Young Bucks were The Elite, but accepted if NJPW continued calling them Bullet Club [...] "in parentheses" [...] as the stable was their [...] "cash cow". He explained the name change by stating that following Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures from NJPW, [...] "Bullet Club [...] so much the Bullet Club anymore", adding that the stable [...] "had all sorts of wrestlers come and go. Some were good, some were bad, some were god-awful", but that [...] "there's a place you can go to watch <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> and entertaining stuff in pro wrestling, and it's The Elite". Omega later added his opinion that Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures had [...] "watered down" [...] Bullet Club's ranks, which is why he wanted to push The Elite to the forefront, claiming that when people said that [...] "Bullet Club [...] been doing some really cool stuff", they always meant him and The Young Bucks and not the other members of the group.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{has participated}} in various {{television}} productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for {{the men in the}} competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She [...] "became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led me very much into a man's world". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as [...] "perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> stunt I ever did". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.|$|E
500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ridiculous</b> performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E

No failure was ever great enough to persuade Attlee to deny one of his cohorts new opportunities to do damage … Shinwell never forgave Gaitskell, whom he blamed for his disgrace."
