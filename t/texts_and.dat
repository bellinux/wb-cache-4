Forty (N= 40) participants completed 12 trials where they were asked to provide 6 judgments: Ease of Learning judgments (EOLs), immediate and delayed Judgments of Learning (JOLs) for both <b>text</b> <b>and</b> graph and Retrospective Confidence Judgments (RCJs). Participants provided significantly lower JOLs for content that contained discrepancies but RCJs remained high across conditions. Discrepancies did not influence study-time allocation, but did significantly influence inference scores. Overall, results suggest that participants may be aware of discrepancies, but lack the control strategies needed to overcome them...|$|R

5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these <b>texts</b> <b>and</b> the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} learning language from unprocessed <b>text</b> <b>and</b> speech signals, concentrating {{on the problem of}} learning a lexicon. In particular, it argues for a representation of language in which linguistic parameters like words are built by perturbing a composition of existing parameters. The power of this representation is demonstrated by several examples in <b>text</b> segmentation <b>and</b> compression, acquisition of a lexicon from raw speech, and the acquisition of mappings between <b>text</b> <b>and</b> artificial representations of meaning. 1 Motivation Language is a robust and necessarily redundant communication mechanism. Its redundancies commonly manifest themselves as predictable patterns in speech <b>and</b> <b>text</b> signals, <b>and</b> it is largely these patterns that enable <b>text</b> <b>and</b> speech compression. Naturally, many patterns in <b>text</b> <b>and</b> speech reflect interesting properties of language. For example, the is both an unusually frequent sequence of letters and an English word.

In this research, the researcher found that there were the differences about theme in source <b>text</b> <b>and</b> theme in target <b>text.</b> <b>And</b> the researcher also found that the number of dissimilar theme was less than the similar one, because this story was pointed and consumed by the children. The number of Ideational, Interpersonal and Textual themes in source <b>text</b> <b>and</b> target <b>text</b> is different because the translator emphasizes something that does not become the theme in source text.
