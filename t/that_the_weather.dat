5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> was deplorable for flight operations {{eight months of}} the year (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|By 13 January {{most of the}} {{survivors}} of the fleet had limped back to France in a state of disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from {{the main body of the}} fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E

5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} and hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 2011 Fowler {{agreed to}} play with Muangthong United, signing a one-year contract.

He was quickly a hit with Muangthong fans and the Thai public in general; he attended Thailand's World Cup Qualifier against Oman wearing the national team's shirt. He has since played a handful of scoreless games, both at the Yamaha Stadium and on the road in the AFC Cup, until the Twin Qilins were eliminated from the competition by Al-Kuwait. After the sacking of Henrique Calisto as head coach, Fowler was made player/coach.|$|E

A third {{member of the}} group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14:05 (GMT), less than five minutes after Shaw had been swept away, and Devon and Cornwall Police, a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw. Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> conditions may be too bad for the helicopter to fly, members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group—a volunteer organisation which co-ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor—set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near 50°W on August29. Later that day, reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a wind shirt and above average shower and thunderstorm activity, but no low-level circulation. At 0600UTC on August30, a tropical depression developed {{just east of}} the Lesser Antilles. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella. The storm moved through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August30. A reconnaissance aircraft into Ella reported sustained winds between 55 and 60mph (95km/h). It was around that time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins and advisories. Ella strengthened into a Category1 hurricane at 1200UTC on August31, six hours later, before becoming a Category2 hurricane. On September1, Ella curved west-northwestward, and by later that day, made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti with winds of 110mph (175km/h). However, the storm was operationally thought to have remained offshore.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 4 June, the Allied {{meteorological}} team, headed by Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force, predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> would improve sufficiently so that the invasion could go ahead on 6 June. He met Eisenhower and other senior commanders at their headquarters at Southwick House in Hampshire to discuss the situation. General Montgomery and Major General Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's chief of staff, were eager to launch the invasion. Admiral Bertram Ramsay was prepared to commit his ships, while Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory {{expressed concern that the}} conditions would be unfavourable for Allied aircraft. After much discussion, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead. Allied control of the Atlantic meant that German meteorologists did not have access to as much information as the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris predicted two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet Hitler to try to get more Panzers.|$|E

5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isbell {{was first}} {{identified}} as a weak tropical disturbance on October7, 1964 over the western Caribbean Sea. Situated {{to the south of}} a diffuse trough, the system remained weak and relatively disorganized as it moved generally northwest near Honduras and Nicaragua. Despite the presence of an upper-level anticyclone, which promotes favorable outflow for tropical cyclones and aids in tropical cyclogenesis, a lack of distinct low-level inflow inhibited intensification. Additionally, an area of warm mid-tropospheric air was present within the cyclone. Though a disheveled system, it is analyzed to have become a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on October8. The following day, the depression skirted the eastern coast of Honduras. Operationally, it was not until October10 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau initiated advisories on the depression. On that date, a weather reconnaissance mission into the system found a weak low-level circulation with a barometric pressure of 1007.3mb (hPa; 29.75inHg) and winds of 20–30mph (30–45km/h) in squalls. Throughout October11 and 12, the depression slowly executed a tight cyclonic loop over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It finally organized into a tropical storm and was given the name Isbell by 00:00UTC on October13 after completing the loop and acquiring a north-northeast trajectory.|$|E
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off for weeks at a time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E

M (2013). <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> Carboniferous Limestone at Bullslaughter Bay, South Wales: {{the first}} example of ghost rock {{recorded}} in the British Isles. Geologica Belgica, 17, 33 - 42. The Carboniferous Limestone at Bullslaughter Bay hosts {{some of the most}} notable examples of deep <b>weathering</b> in <b>the</b> British Isles as well as two members of an enigmatic suite of breccias known as the Gash Breccias. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> limestone has been investigated thoroughly in order to identify the process responsible for <b>the</b> <b>weathering.</b> In this paper it is demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> is isovolumetric but <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> profile is not characterised by a vertical gradient and its depth suggests that meteoric waters did not contribute significantly to <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> limestone has lost significant amounts of calcium and parts are virtually decalcified. It is seen <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dominant primary minerals of illite and quartz have been preserved while secondary clay minerals are generally absent. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> limestone cannot be a saprolite sensu stricto as it has been subjected to only restricted chemical processes. It is, therefore, interpreted as a ?ghost-rock?. This type of weathering results from chemical dissolution by slow moving waters in the saturated zone. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> may have taken place during periods of emergence in the Carboniferous, {{at the same time as}} the cyclothem tops were exposed to subaerial modification, as evidenced by omission surfaces and palaeokarstic solution features.

The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E
