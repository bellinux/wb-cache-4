An effective method was summarized for helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> system rotor dynamic design. A <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> system designed by this method was mounted in a helicopter and performed its first flight-test successfully.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> (TDS) of a {{helicopter}} is vital component {{which is responsible for}} its stability, is often prone to impact damage during combat and is damaged. Usually when the <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is damaged, it is replaced during maintenance. But during the time of conflict, the replacement shaft may not always be available. Hence the damaged shaft is patched by a repair technique known as adhesively bonded repair technique or Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) technique. In this study, finite element analysis is carried out on the undamaged, damaged, and the patched model of the <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> which determines that the deformation, stress and strain in the patched model of the shaft is reduced. Thus, the adhesively bonded repair is an emergency technique that is used to regain the static strength shaft. Mechanical characterization of Kevlar/Epoxy composite material is carried out to choose the apt lay-up sequence for the patch by evaluating its mechanical properties...|$|E

In helicopter transmissions, such a signal {{can usually be}} obtained or derived from an engine or main rotor gearbox accessory, but is not as readily available for the tail rotor gearbox. This report examines whether a separate tail rotor gearbox phase reference signal is necessary by investigating the relative jitter, due to dynamic <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> twist, between phase reference signals obtained from the main and tail rotor gearboxes in a S- 70 A- 9 Black Hawk helicopter...|$|E

50|$|Helicopters play an {{important}} role in enabling the military and law enforcement agencies to conduct special operations behind the enemy line or to carry out humanitarian and relief options. But the threat landscape In these helicopters operate in makes them an easy target for the enemy force or militants. For airborne platforms the threats are not from small arms but from MMG’s, LMG’s and anti-aircraft guns, to name a few. Smart gunners don’t aim to hit a rotary wing aircraft just about anywhere; instead they would aim for the <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> or the engine itself, rendering the aircraft un-maneuverable and leading to a crash landing thereby seriously injuring the occupants or more so causing inevitable fatalities. Hence aircraft are armoured not only to protect the fuselage but also the tail boom housing <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and engines too. On the other hand combat ready fixed wing aircraft move at such high speeds that they are not an easy target moreover the weight of armouring would severely impede their functionality thus purpose.|$|R
40|$|Cracked {{laminations}} of <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{assembly of}} a helicopter {{were sent to the}} laboratory for investigation. Fractographic study confirmed that the laminations (marked 1 to 4) have failed by fatigue. There were multiple fatigue crack origins in each lamination. Examination revealed that all the fastener holes on the laminations were either deformed or oblong. Examination also revealed unusual impression marks around the bolt holes of the laminations suggesting that the flat surface of the washers was in contact instead of the convex surface. From the evidences and analysis, it appears that incorrect assembly was the most probable reason for failure...|$|E
40|$|Because the {{flexible}} multispan shaft in large machines often rotates at supercritical speed, {{it is desirable}} {{to find ways to}} suppress the resulting bending vibration. In this paper, a novel type of support structure is proposed and investigated, which can suppress the bending vibration using dry friction. This approach is called Smart Spring support (SMSS). A dynamic model for the multispan shaft with SMSS is developed. The relationship between the vibration suppression effect and the control parameters of the SMSS is obtained through a numerical example involving a helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> A structure of the SMSS is designed and examined with a rotor test. The results demonstrate that the SMSS has a significant effect on bending vibration suppression of flexible multispan shafts. The vibration-reduction ratio of the peak amplitude reaches 57. 2 % in the numerical example and 45. 2 % in the rotor test...|$|E
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} a helicopter, which met with a Cat-I accident on November 27, 2008, were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that all the four bolts connecting the <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> (TDS) with the main gearbox (MGB) have sheared off. Fractographic study confirmed that these bolts have failed by fatigue. Examination also discovered {{that three of the}} four bolts used were not as per the design specification. It was found that these bolts were longer than that of the recommended one, and they are actually meant for use with the intermediate gearbox (IGB) casing. There was mix-up of bolts and the wrong ones were used in this particular case. The shank length of the IGB bolts is such that it does not provide enough threads to allow tightening of the assembly joint at the TDS connecting flange. Since the bolts cannot travel beyond the first thread from the shank, the reading on the torque wrench during this assembly would have been a wrong indication of tightness of the joint. In fact, the joint was either loose or did not have required pretension. Because of this, there was slip between the TDS connecting flange and the main rotor brake disc. This had resulted in excessive load on the fourth bolt which appears to have failed first by fatigue. Following this, the unequal load distribution in conjunction with the looseness in the joint was responsible for the fatigue failure of the remaining three bolts. Hence, the primary failure in the system was the failure of the bolts at the TDS connecting flange – main rotor brake disc assembly. The other damages seen on other components/structures of the helicopter are secondary in nature and would have occurred subsequent to the primary failure or during crash onto the ground. It is, therefore, stated that the mix-up of the bolts during assembly of the TDS was responsible for the failure and the accident...|$|E
40|$|Helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> (TDS) are safe-life {{items with}} strict limits on {{allowable}} damage. Typically, shafts with scratches {{as small as}} several thousandths of an inch may require replacement. Despite these severe tolerances on damage, TDSs are designed with relatively large ballistic damage tolerance. In battle damage scenarios, repair for damage to TDS caused by small arms fire is required to enable the helicopter to continue its mission or return safely to base. This paper describes a novel repair technique using composite bonded patches to restore the strength of damaged TDSs. Analytical approaches are provided {{for the design of}} the repair. An experimental testing program was conducted to validate the theoretical results. It has been demonstrated in this study that the proposed composite bonded repair possessed sufficient static and fatigue strength to restore the structural integrity of the TDS even with minimal surface treatment...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> system {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the <b>tail</b> boom. The <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled <b>drive</b> for the <b>tail</b> rotor and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the tail rotor, measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The tail rotor pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the tail rotor in forward flight. The tail rotor pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the tail rotor or the tail rotor flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the tail rotor.|$|R

40|$|Helicopters {{are complex}} and {{expensive}} aircraft {{with a level of}} technology that is immature compared to fixed- wing counterparts. Helicopters suffer from vibratory loads stemming from the main rotor and exhibit control and stability problems in the low-speed flight regime. Operating a helicopter near the limits of its flight envelope may result in unacceptable high structural loads which adversely affects wear and tear of drive train components. Conservative safety regulations lead to high operating cost where a significant part can be attributed to maintenance. Manufacturers and operators therefore strive to make helicopters more capable and reliable in an effort to reduce operating cost. Structural load alleviation offers an attractive option to achieve this goal by reducing component damage accumulation and subsequent required maintenance. This thesis investigates structural load alleviation in the <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> train of the UH- 60 Black Hawk. The Black Hawk provides a compelling case for load alleviation research because of its ever growing operational weight and resulting increase of drive train load levels. Furthermore, the lifetime of the UH- 60 is to be extended so that it will fly for many years to come. Current research and applications of rotorcraft structural load alleviation focus on the main rotor but less attention is given to <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> train components. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating manoeuvres that result in critical dynamic loads in the UH- 60 <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> train. A survey of pertinent literature and interviews with helicopter pilots indicate that pedal inputs for left-hand turns in hover lead to high dynamic loads in the UH- 60 <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> train. A flight simulation model is constructed that offers the novel capability to predict dynamic loads in <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> This model consists of an available high fidelity engine model and existing rotor models coupled by a multi body dynamics <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> train model with properties that are based on component measurements and CAD drawings. Experiments are conducted to determine the relation between manoeuvre aggressiveness and dynamic loads in <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> Based on the results a manoeuvre load alleviation control strategy is devised to reduce dynamic loads while ensuring applicable Level 1 handling quality requirements. Application of this control strategy will decrease dynamic loads during left-hand yaw manoeuvres in hover. Furthermore, the results highlight what reduction in loads can be achieved for varying levels of manoeuvre aggressiveness. These findings may aid in the design of flight control systems that incorporate <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> train load alleviation objectives...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{lubrication}} {{tests were}} run with OH- 58 A helicopter <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> bearings. The tests were run in an outdoor environment with ambient temperatures ranging from 10 to 75 F. Dust was periodically {{applied to the}} bearings to simulate field conditions. The cause of bearing failure was associated with dust penetration. Rotor shaft failure {{was found to be}} caused by the shaft rotating in the standard rubber collar due to seizure of the bearings. Bearings with a positive rubbing seal having a MIL-G- 81322 grease produced lives greater than with bearings having labyrinth seals and a mineral oil paste lubricant. An elongated collar prevented failure of the rotor shaft during bearing seizure. In a limited test, installation of tail boom shrouds over the bearings which excluded dust and water resulted in bearing lives in excess of 1800 hours or 1200 hours greater than the current 600 hours TBO, regardless of the lubricant-bearing combination used...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the third phase}} of work, the objective of which was to overcome the excessive brittleness of the previously developed UH- 1 helicopter <b>tail</b> rotor <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> design which demonstrated a shaft train weight savings of 53. 1 % over the current 2024 -T 3 aluminum shaft train. A materials impact program demonstrated exceptionally noteworthy performance of two woven constructions containing E-glass and PRD 49 -III (designation later changed to KEVLAR 49) fibers in an epoxy resin matrix. Thermoplastic matrices and PRD 49 -III fiber provided impact resistance at low weight which was superior to composites having the same fiber in a thermoset resin matrix. A design, fabrication, and test program showed that shaft impact resistance could be improved over the previously developed graphite composite design at a cost in shaft train rate savings. The shaft train weight savings of the most impact tolerant construction was 4. 0 % over the current aluminum shaft train. Alternating plies of graphite and glass appear to provide substantially greater tube impact durability than that provided by hybridization of the two fibers into one tape wound to a ply design equivalent in strength and stiffness {{to that of the}} alternating ply design. Recommendations were made to continue research work to exploit the potential for more impact-durable structures through the use of KEVLAR 49 fiber, woven structures, thermoplastic matrices and THORNEL 50 -S/KEVLAR 49 blends with thermoset matrices...|$|R
