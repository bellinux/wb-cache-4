40|$|Muxama is a {{traditional}} highly-valued food product prepared from dry-cured <b>tuna</b> <b>loins</b> in southern Portugal and Spain. The production procedure has seen little change over the last centuries. The muxama’s stability is due to reduced water activity. In addition, the drying method has secondary effects on characteristics of flavor, color, and the nutritional value of the product. Our objectives were to describe the dynamics of important physicochemical parameters such as moisture content, water activity (aW), NaCl concentration (as water–phase salt, ZNaCl), pH and color, during the salting and drying stages of muxama production, and to test the effect(s) {{of changes in the}} traditional processing conditions followed in southern Portugal, aiming at optimizing the production procedure. The lowest values of moisture and aW and highest ZNaCl obtained after drying <b>tuna</b> <b>loins</b> for seven days at 20 °C exceeded the values reported for commercial products and have impact on the appearance (color) of the product. Therefore, drying <b>tuna</b> <b>loins</b> at lower temperatures (ca. 14 °C) is probably more appropriate. The results obtained in this study could be used in the design of future experiments at other conditions and to assess other quality parameters, e. g., total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBA-RS), microorganism abundance and sensory attributes, and subsequent validation trials...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Dec. 27, 2013 - June 27, 2014 Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen capable of producing enterotoxins causing staphylococcal food poisoning, {{one of the most}} economically important foodborne diseases in the U. S. This pathogen may be introduced to pre-cooked tuna meat used for the production of canned tuna because significant manual handling occurs after cooking of the raw fish to separate the meat from the skin and bones. This study was conducted to investigate the growth and enterotoxin production of five enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains in pre-cooked albacore and skipjack tuna meat held at 37 and 27 °C, the survival of S. aureus in pre-cooked tuna meat stored at - 20 ± 2 °C for 4 weeks and its ability to grow and produce enterotoxins in the pre-cooked tuna meat at 37 °C after frozen storage, and thermal inactivation of enterotoxins in pre-cooked tuna meat at 111 and 121 °C. Frozen pre-cooked albacore <b>tuna</b> (<b>loin,</b> chunk and flake) and skipjack tuna (chunk and flake) obtained from a canned tuna producer were inoculated with five S. aureus strains or highly purified enterotoxins A (SEA), B (SEB), and D (SED) for this study. With an initial inoculation levels of 10 ²⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in inoculated albacore and skipjack tuna meat increased by > 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, respectively. On the other hand, more than 8 and 10 h of incubation at 27 °C were needed to yield the same increase of S. aureus counts (> 3 log CFU/g) in albacore and skipjack samples, respectively. However no enterotoxin was produced in any inoculated albacore or skipjack tuna samples exposed to 37 °C for 12 h or 27 °C for 16 h. S. aureus survived in pre-cooked tuna during frozen storage. With an initial inoculation level of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in all pre-cooked tuna samples decreased slightly (< 0. 7 log CFU/g) after 4 weeks of storage at - 20 ± 2 °C. However, the populations increased rapidly once the samples were thawed and held at 37 °C. Total S. aureus counts in albacore and skipjack samples increased by greater than 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of exposure to 37 °C, respectively. However, no enterotoxin was detected in any samples after 10 h exposure to 37 °C. All the samples showed signs of spoilage before enterotoxin was detected. Studies of heat resistances of SEA, SEB, and SED inoculated to pre-cooked albacore and skipjack tuna meat revealed that the heat resistance of SED was stronger than SEA and SEB, particularly in albacore loin, flake and skipjack flake samples. When samples were inoculated with SEA, SEB and SED at levels of 500 ng/g, a thermal treatment at 121 °C for 15 min inactivated SEA and SEB in all samples and SED in albacore chunk and skipjack chunk but not in albacore loin, flake and skipjack flake samples. However, a process at 111 °C, for 60 min inactivated all SEA, SEB and SED in all tuna samples at levels of 500 ng/g. When the pre-cooked tuna meat samples were inoculated with S. aureus at levels of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, SEA, SEB, and SED were detected in all samples after 36 h of incubation at 37 °C. However, a thermal process of 121 °C for 15 min or 111 °C for 40 min destroyed all enterotoxins...|$|E

Histamine production was studied in <b>tuna</b> <b>loins</b> under different storage and abuse conditions. Tuna was stored at 0 - 2 oC, 3 - 4 oC and 6 - 7 oC and abused for 2 h daily at 20 oC and 30 oC for seven to twelve days. Loins abused at 30 oC for 2 h daily contained potentially toxic histamine concentrations (67 – 382 ppm) when stored at low refrigeration temperature (0 - 2 oC), whereas when stored at 6 - 7 oC the loins contained highly toxic histamine concentrations (544. 5 – 4156. 6 ppm). Lower histamine concentrations (23 to 48 ppm in loins stored at 0 - 2 oC and 124. 7 – 2435. 8 ppm in loins stored at 6 - 7 oC) were observed in temperature abused loins that were initially frozen. An increase over time was observed in most microbial counts tested. Bacteria isolated from the temperature abused loins showed varied ability of histamine production with Morganella morganii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus hominis and Enterococcus hirae being the most active histamine producing bacteria.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of storage temperatures on the shelf life of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> (YFT) <b>loins</b> by studying of microbial, chemical and organoleptic changes. Shelf life of YFT was determined through changes in total aerobic bacterial plate counts (APC), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) trimethylamine (TMA), organoleptic properties and histamine development during storage at 0, 4 and 7 °C. Based on TVB-N value indices, YFT maintained an acceptable shelf life for 21, 17 and 12  days at 0, 4 and 7 °C, respectively. Nevertheless, YFT was rejected earlier by the sensory panellists than their TVB-N value indicated. Histamine development was found to be lower than the European Union safety level for 100  mg/kg fish during storage at 0 and 7 °C for 21 and 17  days, respectively. Aerobic bacteria initially dominated the micro-flora on YFT; however, as storage time increased, aerobic bacteria became dominant at cold storage, but the numbers exceeded the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) limit of 107  cfu/g in storage at 7 °C after 17  days. Therefore, it can be concluded that the storage of fresh YFT in below 4 °C has good enough to the shelf life of products (two weeks) ...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{and fish}} {{products}} {{are among the}} most internationally traded food commodities of which approximately fifty percent originate in developing countries. This raises concerns about seafood safety and quality for the food industry. The Solomon Islands currently export <b>tuna</b> <b>loins</b> to the European Union (EU), which requires accreditation. This lucrative market requires the Solomon Islands to meet stringent standards stipulated by the EU for fishery products. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore and evaluate factors that influence the implementation of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety system at National Fisheries Developments Company Ltd (NFD Ltd) and Soltai Fishing & Processing Company Ltd (Soltai Ltd) in the Solomon Islands, and its effectiveness at meeting stringent EU requirements. A mixed methods research and design was adopted in the study, which involved non-experimental research, survey research and qualitative research (one on one (talanoa) interviews). The study revealed that NFD Ltd and Soltai Ltd are in general terms in compliance with the EU directives (EC 852 / 2004, EC 853 / 2004 and EC 854 / 2004) and the Solomon Islands Pure Food (fishery products) Regulation 2005. Furthermore, while NFD Ltd and Soltai Ltd do have a well documented HACCP system in place, the study showed that the majority of workers do not fully understand the HACCP system. The review of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) on board the fishing vessels revealed that the Chief Engineers, as far as histamine control and monitoring is concerned, are complying with EU Regulation EC 853 / 2004 and the Solomon Islands Pure Food (fishery products) Regulation 2005. The tests carried out to assess microbiological parameters revealed that, a large number of microorganisms were present at all four sites in the processing factory as indicated by Total Plate Counts, a good indicator of product/surface contamination from environmental sources. Furthermore, survey research revealed that a high proportion (43 %) of participants indicated they only adhere to the HACCP system “sometimes” and for some “never” in the factory - which poses significant food safety risk. The qualitative (talanoa) interviews showed that culture and low literacy level were major factors that impede the effective implementation of the HACCP system in the processing factory. The study further indicated that, to control food safety hazards (physical, chemical, and biological), the tuna industry needs a collaborative approach among those involved throughout the food processing chain, from the fishing vessels during harvesting, through to the processing factory and product shipment. Training programmes, including pre-requisite programmes, designed to increase staff awareness of HACCP principles should be comprehensive and ongoing, to ensure sustained implementation of HACCP principles in the workplace. These should be an integral component of the companies‟ HACCP food safety policies and systems...|$|R
40|$|Shelf life of {{meat and}} meat {{products}} depends on the quality {{of meat and}} packaging stability. Meat color change, lipid oxidation, pH, and microbial contamination are the main causes that affect the nutritional, sensory, and physical characteristics by forming toxic compounds, off flavors, off odors, and undesirable color. The first objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of newly developed CO 2 generating absorbent pads on beef, tuna and chicken meats. The second objective was to compare the effect of Type I (radical quenching) antioxidants eugenol and rosmarinic acid (RA) to that of Type II (metal chelating) antioxidants milk mineral (MM), phytate, and sodium tri-polyphosphate (STPP) in raw ground chicken patties. In the first study samples of beef semitendinosus muscle, boneless and skinless chicken breast, and yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>loins</b> were chosen and packaged with four different pad types. Red meats and chicken exhibited trends as would normally be expected during storage. Specifically, color became less appealing (beef and tuna color changed from red to brown, and chicken changed from yellow–pink to grey); pH increased, microbial counts increased, and lipid oxidation (rancidity) increased. Lightness (L*) values for chicken were within 46 – 54, for tuna L* value range was 21 - 26. Redness/greenness (a*) is an indicator of freshness in red meats, and for beef steaks an average value of 12. 32 was noted on day 8, indicative of fresh red color. Recorded average lipid oxidation (TBA values in mg/kg of meat) for chicken (3 ̆c 0. 19 mg/kg) and tuna were low (3 ̆c 0. 16 mg/kg) and for beef (1. 06 mg/kg). Even though there was a significant effect of storage time (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) as expected, no significant (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) differences were observed between the four tested pad types over the 8 -day testing period. In study 2, (Chapter 4) a significant antioxidant effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) was observed in L* values of ground chicken color between treatments. Milk mineral effectively preserved fresh color and slowed lipid oxidation in chicken patties by day 10. Inverse correlations (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) were observed between pH (increasing), and lightness, redness values (decreasing) from day 1 through 10. Increased pH levels from slightly acidic to basic or physiological pH resulted in high numbers for total aerobic plate-counts. There was a significant antioxidant effect on lipid oxidation values by day 10; eugenol and MM were more effective (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than STPP in controlling lipid oxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (0. 198 mg/kg, 0. 198 mg/kg, and 0. 268 mg/kg, respectively). In conclusion, CO 2 generating absorbent pads did not have a positive effect on meat quality, while the antioxidant milk mineral efficiently maintained color, and pH, and controlled lipid oxidation and limited the growth of aerobic bacteria when compared to other antioxidants...|$|R
