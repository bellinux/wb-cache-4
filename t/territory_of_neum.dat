50|$|The Karlovci borders were reaffirmed in 1718 by the Treaty of Požarevac, {{but then}} the Ottomans, tired of {{negotiating}} in vain with Venice for a widening of their maritime access, simply usurped from the Republic <b>of</b> Ragusa the <b>territory</b> <b>of</b> Gornji Klek {{and most of the}} Klek peninsula, which it had bought from King Stjepan of Bosnia {{at the end of the}} 14th century. After the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797 and the Vienna Congress in 1815, the Austrian Empire, which had annexed both the Dalmatian possessions of Venice and the <b>territory</b> <b>of</b> Dubrovnik, tried to buy back the Neum and Sutorina enclaves from the Ottomans, but in vain; instead, it stationed a warship to block access to the port <b>of</b> <b>Neum</b> until the Treaty of Berlin, which gave Vienna the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1878; Neum had been under Ottoman control for 179 years.|$|R

50|$|The Bosnia and Herzegovina coastal strip <b>of</b> <b>Neum</b> {{cuts off}} the southernmost Croatian {{territory}} {{from the rest}} of Croatia.

The road from Neum {{to the rest of}} Herzegovina is in a bad shape. A highway entirely through Croatia (Pelješac Bridge) was planned but is now on hold in favour of upgrading the streets around Neum.|$|R
50|$|Because the Croatian {{mainland}} is intersected {{by a small}} {{strip of}} the coast around the town <b>of</b> <b>Neum</b> {{which is part of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, forming Bosnia and Herzegovina's only outlet to the sea, the physical connection of the southernmost part of Dalmatia with the rest of Croatia is limited to Croatian territorial waters.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{parallel}} A1 motorway ends near Ploče, southbound A1 traffic generally switches to the D8 state road. 30 km after Ploče, the D8 road terminates at the Klek border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the Adriatic Highway route runs across a tiny strip of Bosnia and Herzegovina territory {{around the town}} <b>of</b> <b>Neum.</b> As the route reenters Croatia at Zaton Doli border crossing the D8 state road resumes, running to Dubrovnik along the coastline.

5000|$|The Republic of Ragusa once {{gave the}} town <b>of</b> <b>Neum</b> to the Ottoman Empire {{because it did}} not want to have a land border with Venice; this small {{municipality}} was inherited by Bosnia and Herzegovina and now provides limited sea access, splitting the Croatian part of the Adriatic coast in two. Since Bosnia and Herzegovina is a new country, railways and ports have not been built for its need. There is no freight port along its short coastline at Neum, making it effectively landlocked, although there are plans to change this. Instead the port of Ploče in Croatia is used.|$|R

50|$|The Herzegovinian {{municipality}} <b>of</b> <b>Neum</b> in {{the south}} makes the southernmost part of Croatia an exclave and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that.

Negotiations are still being held.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{close to}} 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas {{are in the}} centre, east and west parts of Bosnia.

This farmland {{is a part of}} the Pannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only 20 km of coastline, around the town <b>of</b> <b>Neum</b> in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a right of passage to the outer sea.|$|R
