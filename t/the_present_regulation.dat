5000|$|After the People’s Republic of China was {{established}} in 1949, private-owned enterprises were replaced by state-owned enterprises. Based on its needs, the government also established public institutions. According to Article 2 of the Interim Regulation on the Registration of Public Institutions,The term [...] "public institutions" [...] as mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>Regulation</b> refers to the public service organizations that are established by the state organs or other organizations by using the state-owned assets {{for the purpose of}} engaging in activities of education, science and technology, culture and hygiene.As a result, the state became the main recruiter and employer. The state not only paid employees’ salaries, but also provided social benefits, which ranged from gifts in Chinese festivals and holidays to welfare and retirement plans. Because these state-run enterprise and institutions guaranteed lifelong employment, employees were paid the same salary. There was a phrase to describe the situation: “No matter whether one works or not, one gets paid thirty-six a month”. Because there was no merit pay, workers were less motivated. Therefore, most sectors experienced the issue of employment redundancy. The effect of employment redundancy includes employees’ low efficiency and employers’ high-cost.|$|E

40|$|In this project, the {{development}} of the three main aquaculture production methods were evaluated through case studies, and analysed in regards of the environmental impacts of the productions. In addition, trends and tendencies within {{the development}} of the sectors were analysed through interviews. It was found that the Danish aquaculture sector as a whole has been stagnated since the early nineties. This stagnation was partly induced by legislative requests more or less corresponding with the national Danish objectives. Furthermore, it was observed that mariculture and freshwater fish farming has decreased the emissions of phosphor and nitrogen to the environment. Recirculated systems were found to have the lowest emission of nitrogen to the aquatic environment, but has the highest production cost per kg/fish produced. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>regulation</b> of the Danish aquaculture production through allowed feed amount were found to be an inappropriate instrument when regulating the national frame of emission. It was concluded that the mariculture industry has few possibilities of development within <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>regulation.</b> Freshwater farming shows initiatives via “modeldambrug” and has possibilities of an enhanced water treatment. This does not lead to an increased production under <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>regulation.</b> The farming of eel in recirculated systems are highly dependent on the delivery of elvers, but could potentially expand by the culturing of new species or if the eel were domesticated. It was concluded that the high level of knowledge in Denmark, regarding water treatment technologies could have great potential if exported to the growing global aquaculture industry. Research in recirculated fish farming is a necessity to maintain the present developmental advantage...|$|E
