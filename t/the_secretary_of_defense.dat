5|$|As the {{president}} begins continuity-of-government procedures, Fisher shuts down the burning plant and averts {{a chain reaction}} to the next reserve. When he captures another senior Engineer, he learns about Sadiq's final plan: to disclose all U.S. military secrets. Sadiq kidnaps <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport. Disregarding {{the president}}'s order, Fourth Echelon infiltrates the base. Despite Cole's infiltration of Sadiq's team, Sadiq's men capture Briggs and torture <b>the</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> into authorizing the transfer. Briggs intervenes, killing the secretary and halting Sadiq's plan.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented {{serious problems with}} the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E

5|$|James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and, {{as former}} CIA Director, {{one of the}} few aware of the aliens' {{existence}} due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North.

5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E

5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> felt the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.|$|E
5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall to his office, and told them that he expected the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|In Arlington County, Virginia, 125 Pentagon workers {{lost their}} lives when Flight 77 crashed into {{the western side of}} the building.

The Army lost 47 civilian employees, six civilian contractors, and 22 soldiers, while the Navy lost six civilian employees, three civilian contractors, and 33 sailors. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) civilian employees were also among the dead in the attack, as well as an Office of <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> (OSD) contractor. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon.|$|E

5000|$|In March 1977, a new post, <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> (Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence), was {{established}} by Defense Directive 5137.1, replacing both the Director, Telecommunications and Command and Control Systems and <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> (Intelligence)/Director <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Intelligence. (The ASD(I) had been established in November 1971, with some functions transferred from <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> (Administration).

50|$|On October 1, 2006, the Office of Force Transformation was disestablished, and its {{functions}} {{spread between}} the Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Under <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Policy, and the Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Under <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.|$|R
5|$|In October 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> {{directed}} {{the formation of}} United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, the Marine component of United States Special Operations Command. It was determined that the Marine Corps would initially form a unit of approximately 2500 to serve with USSOCOM. On February 24, 2006 MARSOC activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. MARSOC initially consisted of a small staff and the Foreign Military Training Unit (FMTU), which had been formed to conduct foreign internal defense. FMTU is now designated as the Marine Special Operations Advisor Group (MSOAG).|$|E
5|$|The President {{holds the}} title of {{commander-in-chief}} of the nation's armed forces and appoints its leaders, <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard {{is run by the}} Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. United States Readiness Command (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, {{did not appear to}} have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General James Lindsay, had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President Ronald Reagan approved {{the establishment}} of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.|$|E
5000|$|Congress {{agreed to}} most of the changes proposed, redesignated the Director as an Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and created <b>the</b> new Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> {{position}} recommended by the DOD report. However, Congress did not agree that the DUSD position should be retained, outside of the five PDUSDS, but gave DOD until January 1, 2015 to eliminate the remaining five DUSDs. Of the five remaining DUSDs, three reported to <b>the</b> Under <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Intelligence. It was determined that these should be redesignated as Directors <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Intelligence. This title was chosen as it [...] "properly convey appropriate status and stature for these principal policy advisors to the" [...] Under <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Intelligence. <b>The</b> DUSD for Instillation and Environment was merged with <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Operation Energy Plans & Programs (renamed <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Energy, Installations, and Environment). The Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Under <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Policy was restructured to eliminate one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> positions, and <b>the</b> DUSD for Strategy Plans and Forces was elevated to Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> for Strategy Plans and Capabilities.|$|R

5|$|On November 23, 2005, Brown, {{together}} with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee announced {{the creation of}} the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). Prior to the creation of MARSOC, the Marine Corps had not been involved in special operations, which were conducted by Army, Navy and Air Force units assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command. After the September 11 attacks, <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> had directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the Global War on Terror. This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM. It was nearly three years later on February 24, 2006, when MARSOC was activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
