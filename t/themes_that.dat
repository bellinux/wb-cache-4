Conversely, the swamp is described in <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E

5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he {{had little choice but to}} present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Biggs and Wedge, {{inspired}} by two Star Wars {{characters of the}} same name, appear in numerous titles as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later titles in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos and Moogles. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments {{as a means of}} long-distance travel for characters. Moogles, on the other hand, are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different capacities in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> have been arranged differently for separate titles.|$|E
5|$|Important {{literary}} {{contributions in}} Kannada were made {{not only by}} court poets, noblemen, royalty, ascetics and saints who wrote in the marga (mainstream) style, but also by commoners and artisans, including cobblers, weavers, cowherds and shepherds who wrote in the desi (folk) style. These Vachana poets (called Vachanakaras) revolutionised Kannada literature, rejecting traditional <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> eulogised kings and noblemen, and writing didactic poems that were closer to the spoken and sung form of the language. In addition to hundreds of male poets, over thirty female poets have been recorded, some of whom wrote along with their husbands.|$|E

5|$|Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei {{became an}} {{important}} film in Vadivelu's career. It continued a trend of films with different <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> focused on social issues. K. Jeshi of The Hindu placed it in a category of films that discuss social issues like Sethu... (1999), Kaadhal (2004), Veyil (2006), Mozhi (2007) and Paruthiveeran (2007). Another critic from The Hindu, Sumit Bhattacharjee, compared it with other period films like The Ten Commandements (1956) Ben-Hur (1959) Titanic (1997), Gladiator (2000), 300 (2007) and Jodhaa Akbar (2008).|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Preckwinkle {{decided to}} paint over two 36-year-old, unmaintained and {{severely}} damaged public murals in the 47th Street Metra underpass. The murals {{had been created}} by graffiti artists, working with permission from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> included Latin-American, African, Mayan, Indian, and Native American spiritual practices. The walls were later covered with newly commissioned murals: one {{is made up of}} a series of ceramic tiles and the other is a traditional painted mural featuring the city and important historical South Side figures, including former Alderman Dorothy Tillman.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, {{plans for}} a Japanese anime version, Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z, were announced. The series premiered in Japan the {{following}} year with 52 half-hour episodes, airing each Saturday from July 1 to December 23, 2006, and from January 6 to June 30, 2007. The series deviated from its American predecessor in terms of style, storyline, and characterization, but only minimally retained the essential <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> made the original a success. The characters feature three junior high school students Momoko Akatsutsumi (Hyper Blossom), Miyako Gotokuji (Rolling Bubbles), and Kaoru Matsubara (Powered Buttercup) as the three heroes. A manga adaptation, illustrated by Shiho Komiyuno, was serialized in Shueisha's Ribon magazine between June 2006 and July 2007.|$|E

5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E
5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> arise {{from other parts of the}} world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E

5|$|Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 American crime {{film and}} the feature-length debut of writer and {{director}} Quentin Tarantino. It features Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Tim Roth, Tarantino, and criminal-turned-author Edward Bunker {{as members of a}} botched diamond heist. The film depicts the events before and after the heist. Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks and Steven Wright also play supporting roles. It incorporates many <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling.|$|E
5|$|Southey {{uses the}} poem to {{describe}} various superstitions and myths, {{with a heavy}} reliance on repetition of various <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> link the myths together. Although based in Islamic theology, most of the action is mechanical instead of emphasising possible moral truths that {{can be drawn from}} the plot. Though the main character is purported to be a Muslim, the story actually takes place thousands of years before Islam, in ancient Babylon. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry. However, other critics felt that the lack of a strong lyrical structure and the use of Middle Eastern myths detracted from the poem.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch {{influenced}} later works {{within the}} Jim Henson universe as well, including {{the television show}} Dinosaurs produced by The Jim Henson Company. The first episode of Dinosaurs featured a plot line supporting environmentalism that was similar to an episode of The Land of Gorch. The Land of Gorch segment from the November 8, 1975 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Candice Bergen included <b>themes</b> <b>that</b> were reused in Dinosaurs.|$|E
