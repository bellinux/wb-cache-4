5|$|Wear facets {{are areas}} of a tooth that show {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified <b>two</b> <b>wear</b> facets at {{the front and back}} margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.|$|E
500|$|In {{making people}} of each {{ethnicity}} look alike, Spiegelman hoped {{to show the}} absurdity of dividing people along such lines. [...] Spiegelman has stated that [...] "these metaphors... are meant to self-destruct" [...] and [...] "reveal the inanity of the notion itself". [...] Professor Amy Hungerford saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor. [...] Rather, it signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their races—the gentile Françoise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims. [...] When asked what animal he would make Israeli Jews, Spiegelman suggests porcupines. [...] When Art visits his psychiatrist, the <b>two</b> <b>wear</b> mouse masks. [...] Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's making—in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, {{but by the time}} the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask. [...] In Maus, the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans. Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.|$|E
500|$|... is the {{daughter}} of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. She seems to have inherited traits from both her parents, like her mother's [...] verbal tic and her father's aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge certain people, but she is not above commending them when they truly deserve it. Sarada is a central character of Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, searching for her estranged father while feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada felt hurt and betrayed when she suspects being Karins's biological child as the <b>two</b> <b>wear</b> similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family {{is not a matter of}} blood, Sarada later learns that Sakura is her biological mother as Karin explained that she was Sakura's midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage one day. She finds Boruto annoying, but is later hinted to have a mutual crush on him. Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese. While in the English version, she is voiced by Laura Bailey in , and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances.|$|E

5000|$|A {{gauge block}} is {{a block of}} metal or ceramic with two {{opposing}} faces ground precisely flat and parallel, a precise distance apart. Standard grade blocks are made of a hardened steel alloy, while calibration grade blocks are often made of tungsten carbide or chromium carbide because it is harder and wears less. [...] Gauge blocks come in sets of blocks of various lengths, along with <b>two</b> <b>wear</b> blocks, to allow {{a wide variety of}} standard lengths to be made up by stacking them. The length of each block is actually slightly shorter than the nominal length stamped on it, because the stamped length includes the length of one wring film, a film of lubricant which separates adjacent block faces in normal use. The thickness of the wring film is about [...] The gauge's nominal length is also known as the interferometric length.|$|E
