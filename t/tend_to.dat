5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E

Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent.

Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness.
