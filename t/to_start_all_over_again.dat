25|$|Respecting one's {{health and}} {{physical}} well-being {{was one of the}} foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S, an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with the letter A.|$|E
25|$|Ruskin {{was born}} at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London (demolished 1969), south of St Pancras railway station. His {{childhood}} was characterised by the contrasting influences {{of his father and}} mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's Romanticism. They shared a passion for the works of Byron, Shakespeare and especially Walter Scott. They visited Scott's home, Abbotsford in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance. Margaret Ruskin, an Evangelical Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the King James Bible from beginning to end, and then <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.|$|E

500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me now and I felt free to mix them all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E
2500|$|When Perry and McKee {{first met}} in 2004, {{they both were}} [...] "really into Lolita" [...] and [...] "had a mutual fascination with the {{adolescent}} state of mind." [...] They explored the themes in their first records: Perry wrote One of the Boys, which touched on {{the early stages of}} discovering that boys could be more than friends, whereas McKee wrote [...] "Confessions of a Teenage Girl", which was about using sexual power to one's advantage. For the Teenage Dream sessions, Perry and McKee had a [...] "forever young" [...] idea in mind. Perry at first wrote a lyric about Peter Pan, but they later deemed it as [...] "too young" [...] since [...] "we wanted it to have more edge, more sex." [...] Another version included the lines [...] "And {{the next thing you know}} / You're a mom in a minivan", which made them laugh uncontrollably for an hour. There was a final version that was based around the metaphor of [...] "" [...] comparing clothes to sex, in a similar manner to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up". It was rejected by the producers, as McKee explained, [...] "Luke always makes us 'Benny Proof' everything. He says that if Benny doesn't get it, America won't get it." [...] Blanco showed them The Teenagers's 2007 single [...] "Homecoming" [...] and asked them to write in a similar style. McKee said that [...] " [...] looked at each other with dread, knowing we had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.....</b> We were both so over it we just called it a night." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yes, {{it was a}} {{peaceful}} sort of life, {{but by the end}} of the first week I began to wish that Jimmy Pinkerton had arranged to come down earlier: for as a companion Freddie, poor old chap, wasn't anything to write home to mother about. When he wasn't chewing a pipe and scowling at the carpet, he was sitting at the piano, playing [...] "The Rosary" [...] with one finger. He couldn't play anything except [...] "The Rosary," [...] and he couldn't play much of that.

Well----As long as I can sit and play pinochle with Bea, and tell whoppers to Olaf about his daddy's adventures in the woods, and how he snared a wapaloosie and knew Paul Bunyan, why, I don't mind being a bum.

60|$|I {{was very}} tired. But when I got into bed, it was {{impossible}} to sleep. My eyes smarted from the tobacco smoke; and the events of the day, in disorderly manner, kept running through my head. The tide of my exhilaration had ebbed, and I found myself struggling against a revulsion caused, apparently, by the contemplation of Colonel Varney and his associates; the instruments, in brief, by which our triumph over our opponents was to be effected. And that same idea which, when launched amidst the surroundings of the Boyne Club, had seemed so brilliant, now took on an aspect of tawdriness. Another thought intruded itself,--that of Mr. Pugh, the president of the Ribblevale Company. My father had known him, and some years before I had traveled halfway across the state in his company; his kindliness had impressed me. He had spent a large part of his business life, I knew, in building up the Ribblevale, and now it was to be wrested from him; he was to be set aside, perhaps forced <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> when old age was coming on! In vain I accused myself of sentimentality, and summoned all my arguments to prove that in commerce efficiency must be the only test. The image of Mr. Pugh would not down.|$|E

5000|$|At {{their first}} conference, Hitchcock {{made a show}} of {{pinching}} his nose, then holding up Chandler's draft with his thumb and forefinger and dropping it into a wastebasket.
