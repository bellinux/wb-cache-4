40|$|The {{secretory}} {{evolution of}} the <b>thymic</b> <b>hormones</b> (thymulin, thymosin alpha 1 and thymopoietin) in cultured thymic reticuloepithelial cells (TREC) was studied by immunocytochemical techniques using monoclonal anti-thymulin or anti-thymosin alpha 1 and polyclonal anti-thymopoietin antibodies (Ab). The culture of TREC was performed with a medium where L-valine was replaced by D-valine, thus ensuring rapid and selective development of these cells. The number of thymulin, thymosin alpha 1 or thymopoietin-containing cells increased progressively from Day 6 to Day 12 of the culture. The localization of the three <b>thymic</b> <b>hormones</b> within the TREC also varied according {{to the age of}} the culture. By light microscopy the staining of the three hormones was localized in some cytoplasmic granules {{at the beginning of the}} culture and at Day 90, while at Day 12 it was throughout the cytoplasm. In electron microscopy these localizations corresponded respectively to vacuoles of different sizes and to cytosol.

Reactivation of disease occurred in 26 patients (86 %) during or after treatment withdrawal and was as frequent in the Thymostimulin treated (11 of 13; 84 %) and untreated (15 of 17; 88 %; p greater than 0. 05) groups.

Patients with TM presented significantly lowered plasma zinc and thymulin levels when compared to normal subjects, The significant enhancement of the active form of the hormone after zinc addition in vitro suggests that low thymulin values found in TM are due not to a thymic failure in synthesizing and secreting the <b>thymic</b> <b>hormone,</b> but a defect in zinc saturation of the hormone.

40|$|The {{case of an}} 18 -month-old child, {{affected}} by malnutrition, severe interstitial pneumonia and immunological abnormalities is reported. Since the age of 10 months, the infant suffered from severe recurrent infections and failure to thrive. Immunological studies revealed a striking decrease of T lymphocytes and of natural killer (NK) function. Serum immunoglobulins, salivary IgA, natural isohaemagglutinins, Fc-IgG receptor-bearing cells and suppressor T lymphocytes were absent, together with an impaired de novo DNA synthesis after PHA, Con A, PWM and Cowan I strain from Staphylococcus aureus stimulation. In vitro incubation of the patient's lymphocytes with TP- 5, a thymopoietin-derived synthetic pentapeptide, resulted in improvement of sheep rosettes, Fc-IgG receptor-positive lymphocytes and NK activity. The child was therefore treated with TP- 5 for 8 months and his clinical condition improved {{as well as the}} number of T cells, Fc-IgG-positive lymphocytes and NK function. However, humoral immunity remained persistently depressed. We suggest that this child could be classified as {{affected by}} 'late-onset severe combined immunodeficiency'. In vitro assays with <b>thymic</b> <b>hormones</b> or synthetic drugs that mimic the action of <b>thymic</b> <b>hormones</b> should be performed and this therapy could be applied in the treatment of some of these heterogeneous syndromes, especially when an immunological reconstitution with bone marrow or fetal graft cannot be attempted...|$|R

In this paper we evaluate the response to immunotherapy, with an extractive thymic hormone: thymostimulin at the dosage of 1 mg/kg/day; 20 patients of a group of 40 underwent CBP. Immunological monitoring was obtained with the "multitest CMI", a disposable skin test to evaluate changes of lymphocytes, especially T cells.

40|$|Twenty-three {{patients}} with {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} disease were studied for circulating <b>thymic</b> <b>hormone</b> levels (facteur thymique serique, FTS), 21 prior to treatment by transplantation of bone marrow, thymus or fetal liver. Thirteen showed undetectable FTS activity. Only two had normal levels of this hormone. In serial determinations of FTS activity prior to and after transplantation, patients given bone marrow transplants developed sustained increments of serum FTS activity early {{in the course of}} their immunological reconstitution. However, patients given transplants of fetal liver alone or fetal liver plus thymus from fetuses of less than 12 weeks gestation generally did not show an increment of FTS activity during the period of observation. Transplantation of irradiated thymus derived from fetuses of more than 14 weeks gestation produced sustained increases of <b>thymic</b> <b>hormone</b> activity. These observations suggest that a cell of haematopoietic origin provides a stimulus necessary for differentiation or maturation of thymic secretory activity and that this cell(s) is present in post-natal marrow, but is either undeveloped or immature in the early fetal liver or fails to migrate to the thymus of an allogeneic host...|$|E

To {{determine whether or not}} not the apparent thymic requirement for TdT expression in bone marrow was mediated by <b>thymic</b> <b>hormones,</b> we examined the effects of thymosin fraction 5. Treatment of either NIH Swiss nu/nu or thymectomized C 57 BL/ 6 mice with thymosin fraction 5 restored the levels of TdT activity in BSA gradient-fractionated bone marrow cells to normal. Moreover, treatment of BSA gradient-fractionated bone marrow cells from NIH Swiss nu/nu or thymectomized C 57 BL/ 6 mice in tissue culture with thymosin fraction 5 induced TdT expression. In tissue culture, TdT induction was optimal with 25 ng/ml of thymosin fraction 5, it occurred within 6 h, and it was completely inhibited by actinomycin D. The effect was specific in that neither control nor spleen fraction 5 - treated cells were induced to express TdT.

SDIP and FTS were eluted with identical retention times in high performance liquid chromatography analysis in three different systems. When tested in sheep cell rosettes, and in the FTS radioimmunoassay in J. F. Bach's laboratory, SDIP presented an activity similar to FTS. In order to compare the <b>thymic</b> <b>hormone</b> to SDIP the biological activity of FTS was determined in in vivo and in in vitro humoral immunity reactions to a T-dependent antigen. As SDIP, FTS inhibited in vivo and in vitro the 19 S-bearing cell formation during the last step of the differentiation of the lymphocytes, in the same range of concentration. The two factors appeared to stimulate the incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine into the DNA of short-term cultures of thymocytes. The similarity of biological properties of SDIP and FTS together with the similarity observed in the physico-chemical and biochemical properties led to the conclusion that bovine spleen contains a factor similar to FTS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{trace element}} zinc is {{essential}} for the immune system, and zinc deficiency affects multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. There are remarkable parallels in the immunological changes during aging and zinc deficiency, including a reduction in the activity of the thymus and <b>thymic</b> <b>hormones,</b> a shift of the T helper cell balance toward T helper type 2 cells, decreased response to vaccination, and impaired functions of innate immune cells.

Consequently, oral zinc supplementation demonstrates the potential to improve immunity and efficiently downregulates chronic inflammatory responses in the elderly.

These signs of infection lasted from day 5 to day 14 after infection when mice slowly started to recover. Systemic treatment of MCMV-infected mice with thymic humoral factor (THF) resulted in a reconstitution of the mitogenic responses, IL- 2 secretion, normalization of spleen weight and recovery of liver inflammation.

40|$|The thymus {{produces}} humoral {{factors that}} induce proliferation and differentiation of T-cells, which {{are responsible for}} cell-mediated immunity. Recent data in animals suggest that such <b>thymic</b> <b>hormone</b> activity is modulated by the neuroendocrine network and, in particular, by thyroid hormones, but no information is presently available in humans. To study this question, we measured the circulating thymic factor called thymulin (Zn-FTS) in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients. Thymulin levels were higher in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects, whereas hypothyroid patients had lower thymulin levels than normal subjects. A significant correlation was found between circulating thymulin and serum T 4 and T 3 levels. Thymulin changes could be reversed by appropriate treatment in both groups of patients. Recent data indicate that zinc is required to confer biological activity on <b>thymic</b> <b>hormone</b> molecules. This {{raised the question of}} whether the influence of thyroid status on thymulin activity could be mediated by changes in serum zinc concentrations.
