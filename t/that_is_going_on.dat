5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> remaining {{unaffected by the}} changes in the timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E
25|$|I believe President Bush {{is running}} deficits in Washington very deliberately. His {{plan is to}} finally run up so much debt that it inevitably creates {{pressure}} on the funding of things that count, {{in terms of the}} long-term strength of the society: educating kids, retirement security for American families. A mini version of <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Sacramento.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E

25|$|Kwan {{introduces}} Hamilton to Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver), {{a beautiful}} young assistant at the British embassy. Kwan and Bryant are close friends, and he subtly manipulates her encounters with Hamilton. After resisting Hamilton because she's returning to the United Kingdom, Bryant {{falls in love with}} him. Discovering that the Communist Chinese are arming the PKI, Bryant passes this information to Hamilton to save his life, but he wants to cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Shocked, Kwan and Bryant withdraw their friendship from Hamilton, and he is left with the American journalist Pete Curtis (Michael Murphy), and his own assistant and driver Kumar (Bembol Roco), who is secretly PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Hamilton and tries to open his eyes to all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
500|$|Shoumatoff {{observes that}} [...] "Reading Bates is an {{emotional}} experience {{for someone who has}} travelled in Amazonia, because much of what he describes so poignantly is no longer there"; that the [...] "charm and the genius" [...] of the book is that Bates covers both natural history and everything else <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> — as the subtitle so accurately says, [...] "A Record of Adventures, Habits of Animals, Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life, and Aspects of Nature Under the Equator, During Eleven Years of Travel." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush {{called the}} overall track [...] "catchy" [...] and {{described}} the cake metaphor mentioned throughout the song to be [...] "hilarious". However, Kia Makarechi from The Huffington Post provided a more mixed review of [...] "Decisions", feeling that it was [...] "neither particularly inventive nor that cathartic". Writing for YourEDM, Elliot Sachs was disappointed that Cyrus' vocals came across as [...] "faint and minuscule in comparison to all the brouhaha <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> at the same time." [...] In February 2014, Chris Wood from YourEDM noted that [...] "Decisions" [...] became an [...] "interesting pivot point" [...] in Borgore's career, which [...] "pushed [...] into {{the early stages of}} a pop icon within electronic music scene".|$|E

500|$|McElwain {{completed}} his GED courses {{and planned to}} go to college, and has a full-time job at Wegmans Food Markets in Greece, New York. Jason is often seen, too, at the local Olympia Family Restaurant, in Greece, New York. [...] Occasionally, customers recognize him and ask for an autograph. McElwain also travels across the United States to help raise funds for autism research and to make media appearances. With all the activity <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> his life, Jason admitted that he hasn't been playing as much basketball, but says that, [...] "Occasionally, I'll go and shoot baskets at the YMCA." [...] McElwain is also involved in public speaking, including an October 2011 speech at the Jefferson Rehabilitation House's annual dinner. Since 2007, McElwain {{has also been a}} volunteer coach for the Greece Athena team alongside Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} office, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) {{begins to}} write invitations for her {{approaching}} wedding with help from Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling). Kelly talks about her dreams of getting married someday and is visibly hurt when Ryan responds to her flirtatious question about future weddings by saying he doesn't think he'll ever tie the knot; when Kelly leaves the room, Pam advises Ryan to be considerate of Kelly's feelings but Ryan curtly notes [...] "I know what I said." [...] Jim makes plans for a vacation anywhere away from Scranton. While <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> the other employees subtly duel over the thermostat. At {{the end of the}} episode, Jim tells Pam that he will be going to Australia and unfortunately, he will be missing her wedding because of it.|$|E
500|$|Mills was {{dismissed}} {{after nearly two}} and a half years in charge on 2 March 2013 after York were beaten 2–0 at home to Bradford, with the team sitting four points above the relegation zone after an 11-match run without a win. Former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington was appointed as his successor two days later, with Fred Barber joining from Bury as his assistant. Mills' remaining coaching staff of Darron Gee, Des Lyttle and Paul Musselwhite left the club. Following his appointment, Worthington indicated the players out on loan would return to the club, saying, [...] "It's only right that contracted players should be in and around the club over the next 10 matches as York City are paying their salaries and they should be part of anything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the next two months". Worthington's first signing was Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Arron Jameson, who joined on an emergency loan for the remainder of the season, while McGrath had his loan extended until the end of the season.|$|E

It was {{a bitter}} pill {{to me to}} have to receive him [...] after all {{that has taken place}} and with all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> He talked a great deal about Rudolf, and said that a scene with the Emperor [...] had taken place, {{according}} to Reuss's account.

2500|$|Janice Folk-Dawson, {{chairwoman}} of the university workers committee, stated that resolution will protect {{the quality of education}} by preventing Israeli academics from professing biased views. She also stated that [...] "International pressure on Israel must increase to stop the massacre <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> daily. We are proud to add CUPE voices to others from around the world saying enough is enough" [...] and that support for the resolution [...] "is coming from the rank-and-file members, not just the leadership." [...] Despite the expected backlash, Folk-Dawson stated that [...] "We believe we are doing the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the MTA {{began to}} look at ways of {{displaying}} service disruptions due to weekend engineering works in a visual format. They invited Vignelli Associates (comprising at that time Massimo Vignelli, Yoshiki Waterhouse, and Beatriz Cifuentes) to develop a digital version of the 2008 map. On September 16, 2011, the MTA introduced a Vignelli Associates interactive subway map, called [...] "The Weekender", to its website. As the title suggests, {{it is a way}} for riders to get information about any planned work, from late Friday night to early Monday morning, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> either on a service(s) or station(s) of the subway during the weekend only. On June 11, 2012, the MTA duplicated [...] "The Weekender" [...] site as a free mobile app download for iOS. On November 29, 2012, an Android version of the app was released. The Weekender, however, is only available as an online version, because it changes every week.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Stop!' {{cried the}} men; {{at which the}} coachman pulled up with {{extraordinary}} obedience. Runt all the while lay tipsy in the carriage, having only a dreamy half-consciousness of all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
