60|$|It {{must be an}} {{extraordinary}} religion that flourishes in such a place, an artificial faith that needs heat like tropical plants, that desires unnatural vows. It breathes of neurotic emotions with its damask-covered walls, with its carpet that deadens the footfall, its sombre, gorgeous pictures. The sweet breeze of heaven never enters there, nor the sunlight; the air is languid with incense; one is oppressed by a strange, heavy silence. In such a church sins must be fostered for the morbid pleasure of confession. One can imagine that the worshippers in that overloaded atmosphere would see strange visions, voluptuous and mystical; the Blessed Mary and the Saints might gain visible and palpable flesh, and the devil would not be far off. There the gruesome imaginings of Valdes Leal are a fitting decoration. Every one knows that grim picture of a bishop in episcopal robes, eaten by worms, his flesh putrefying, which led Murillo to say: 'Leal, you make me hold my nose,' and the other answered: 'You have taken all the flesh and left me nought but the bones.'

40|$|Abstract Inherited factor VII (FVII) {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} disorder {{characterized by}} a bleeding phenotype varying from mild to severe. To date, more than 200 mutations have been described along the F 7 gene encoding for FVII. The {{aim of this study}} was the identification of genetic defects underlying FVII deficiency in 10 patients belonging to eight unrelated families of the North provinces from Tunisia. Mutation detection was performed by sequencing the whole F 7 gene coding region, exon-intron boundaries and about 400 [*]bp of the promoter region. We identified 5 mutations in five unrelated families; the novel p. F 328 Y mutation and the reported mutations: p. R 304 Q, p. M 298 I, IVS 1 aG[*]>[*]A and p. G- 39 G. For the remaining 5 patients we didn’t identified any mutations using PCR/Sequencing protocol. In conclusion, this study represents the first comprehensive molecular series of FVII deficiency affected patients in Tunisia from the North. We will try in the future to continue the molecular study for Tunisian patients from Center and South provinces in order <b>to</b> have a <b>complete</b> <b>idea</b> about the FVII deficiency mutational profile in our country.

40|$|An antenna is {{considered}} to be placement-immune when the antenna operates effectively regardless of where it is placed. By building antennas on magnetic conductor materials, the radiated fields will be positively reinforced in the desired radiation direction instead of being negatively affected by the environment. Although this idea has been discussed thoroughly in theoretical research, the difficulty in building thin magnetic conductor materials necessary for in-phase field reflections prevents this technology from becoming more widespread. This project's purpose is to build and measure an electrically-small antenna on a new type of non-metallic, thin magnetic conductor. This problem has not been previously addressed because non-metallic, thin magnetic conductor materials have not yet been discovered. This work proposed the creation of an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) with in-phase field reflections without using internal electric conductors, the placement of an electrically-small antenna on this magnetic conductor, {{and the development of a}} transmit-receive system that utilizes the substrate and electrically-small antenna. By not using internal electric conductors to create the AMC, the substrate thickness can be minimized. The electrically-small antenna will demonstrate the substrate's ability to make an antenna placement immune, and the transmit-receive system combines both the antenna and the substrate while adding a third layer of system complexity <b>to</b> demonstrate the <b>complete</b> <b>idea...</b>|$|R

When people are in a conversation, the often use fragments, incomplete sentences which are spoken or written {{as if they were}} <b>complete</b> sentences, <b>to</b> express those ideas, feelings opinions, or information. In a conversation, fragments can be used because the interlocutor has the facilities to answer the questions by using the other fragments in order <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> their <b>ideas,</b> feelings, opinions, and information as long as the interlocutor understand what each of them mean. Besides that, the interlocutor wants to be in a relax situation. However, fragments cannot be used in the formal compositions because the writer cannot use the speaking advantages to express the ideas, feelings, opinions, or information. That is why, fragments can disturb the readers and also destroy the meanings of the sentences in a composition. To find out whether the English Department students make the fragments in their compositions or not, the writer carried out the study under report at the English Department of Widya mandala University by studying and analyzing the writing V final test.
