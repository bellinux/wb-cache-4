Meanwhile, Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. After the humans maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and destroying it by using Jake's wrist gauntlet as a bomb, obliterating the ship.|$|E

5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. <b>This</b> <b>knowledge</b> allowed him to design architectural projects, including {{all the elements of}} his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon <b>this</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E

Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. <b>This</b> <b>knowledge</b> could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.|$|E

Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply <b>this</b> <b>knowledge</b> to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed <b>this</b> <b>knowledge</b> to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E

He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by <b>this</b> <b>knowledge</b> to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group.
