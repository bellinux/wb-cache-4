It combined pieces of poetry, visual poetry, electronic and multimedia poetry.In 2004, she published El blog del niño burbuja (The Bubleboy blog) {{one of the first}} experiments in fiction blogs. In 2006 she published on the Internet the WordToys, an anthology of her net-poems produced between 1996 and 2006 and one of her most widely known pieces. Here she proposes the exercise of reading as a decoding task as well as a ludic activity. The fourteen net-poems in this anthology are rooted on the historical avant-gardes, using strategies as randomness, tautology, appropriations and are influenced by concrete and conceptual writing. A second collection made in 2011, Gongora WordToys, focuses on the figure of the Spanish Baroque poet Luis de Gongora deconstructing his masterpiece Soledades (Solitudes).Since 2010, she develops the Sultan Florvag project, an example of [...] "distributed literature" [...] or [...] "literature across networks", through different media (blogs, YouTube, and other platforms 2.0) that invites the reader to reconstruct the story of the fictional character of Commander Aukan, a Panamerican revolutionary who is also an unknown poet and video artist.|$|E

40|$|People like books. They are {{convenient}} {{and can be}} accessed easily and enjoyably. In contrast, many view the experience of accessing and exploring electronic documents as dull, cumbersome and disorientating. This thesis claims that modelling digital documents as <b>physical</b> <b>books</b> can significantly improve reading performance. To investigate this claim, a realistic electronic book model was developed and evaluated. In this model, a range of properties associated with <b>physical</b> <b>books</b> [...] -analogue page turning, bookmarks and annotations [...] -are emulated. Advantage is also taken of the digital environment by supporting hyperlinks, multimedia, full-text search over terms and synonyms, automatically cross referencing documents with an online encyclopaedia, and producing a back-of-the-book index. The main technical challenge of simulating <b>physical</b> <b>books</b> is finding a suitable technique for page turning that is sufficiently realistic, yet lightweight, responsive, scalable and accessible. Several techniques were surveyed, implemented and evaluated. The chosen technique allows realistic books to be presented in the Adobe Flash Player, {{the most widely used}} browser plug-in on the Web. A series of usability studies were conducted to compare reading performance while performing various tasks with HTML, PDF, <b>physical</b> <b>books,</b> and simulated books. They revealed that participants not only preferred the new interface, but completed the tasks more efficiently, without any loss in accuracy...|$|R

Our design achieves interactive page turning by employing page textures of multiple resolutions at different stages of page turning, solving the scalability problem. By modeling all the faces of the book and synchronizing the movements of various portions of the book during page turning, our design helps to convey the impression of reading or viewing an actual <b>physical</b> <b>book...</b>|$|R

Bridging book consists of a printed book and a digital device, placed side-by-side, with synchronized content. Thumbing through the book's pages triggers the device to display the complementary digital content. The <b>physical</b> <b>book</b> requires no batteries or wires. In the current version, the printed illustrations on each page of the <b>physical</b> <b>book</b> are extended into the device screen, offering further interaction. The content can be explored both linearly by reading and thumbing the printed book and/or exploring the interaction on the digital device. We also briefly explain the planned future study observation, with children, to evaluate our prototype...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an interactive mobile augmented reality magical playbook for preschool children in learning numbers using an old folklore literature, The Thirsty Crow, via mobile augmented reality application and interactive <b>physical</b> <b>book</b> interface design. Augmented Reality (AR) refers to a technology that gives the ability to the user the sense of the real world while interacting with the virtual and physical object. Mobile refers to portability usefulness of the application itself, thus mobile AR application can be referred as a portable AR application. The real world can be enhanced by AR through augmented virtual object into real environment and providing some additional information for users. By applying this concept to AR storybook, the <b>physical</b> <b>book</b> (the real world) will be enhanced by augmenting the virtual object (3 D models, animations, and sounds) viewed over a mobile device. This paper specifically highlights an innovative development of the interfaces for providing an AR storybook that enhanced story reading and learning experience for preschool children via mobile AR application and highly interactive <b>physical</b> <b>book</b> interface design of the AR book. Findings from the initial observational study based on developed prototype are also presented. For future work, there will be a series of interactive mobile AR magical playbook using other old folklore story...|$|R
