25|$|Albus Dumbledore {{was tall}} and thin, with silver hair and beard (auburn in his youth) so long {{that they could be}} tucked into his belt. He had a very long and crooked nose <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may {{have played a role in}} shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.|$|E
25|$|Tina Louise is Ginger Grant, {{the movie}} star. Louise clashed with {{producer}} Sherwood Schwartz because {{she believed that}} she was hired as the central character. Her character was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play it as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play her as a Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield type. Louise continued to clash with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to return {{for any of the}} post-series TV movies, saying that the role had killed her career as a serious actress. She did, however, appear in a reunion of the cast on a late-night television talk show in 1988 and on an episode of Roseanne in 1995 when the Roseanne cast re-enacted Gilligan's Island. In the first season, Ginger often wore gowns <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were tailored from Minnow tarpaulins or similar substitute cloth (some had the name of the vessel stenciled on them). In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger, no last name, (then a secretary) was played by actress Kit Smythe.|$|E
500|$|Some special effects, like Motoko's [...] "thermo-optical camouflage", were {{rendered}} {{through the}} use of TIMA software. The process uses a single illustration and manipulates the image as necessary to produce distortions for effect in combination with a background without altering the original illustration. The effect is re-added back into the shot to complete the scene. While the visual displays used in the film were technically simple to create, the appearance of the displays underwent numerous revisions by the production team to best represent visual displays of the future. Another aspect of the CG use was to create images and effects <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were [...] "perceived by the brain" [...] and were generated in video and added to the film in its final stages.|$|E

2500|$|The first 63 {{issues of}} Animal Man {{featuring}} Bolland's artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland's images maintaining a continuity {{of style and}} imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would [...] "go through and find a scene <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it would make a}} good cover," [...] or [...] "find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what's going on inside the book." [...] This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison's tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of Animal Man to DC's new 'Mature Readers' imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to [...] "full color painted covers" [...] with issue No. 57. These of his covers were [...] "a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel," [...] which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that [...] "some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me." ...|$|E
60|$|Will pursed up {{his smooth}} sensuous face <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it had never}} needed shaving. Lettie went out with Marie, hearing the bell ring.|$|E
6000|$|... "Iss," [...] says he, {{with a nod}} <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was jerked out of him by a {{most violent}} hiccup--which is the way with those savages.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{you have}} not? Just so. You confirm my own impression. Does <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I cared for her? I ask, for information.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{classified}} the Princess {{with that}} distinct type of woman <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it habitually {{went out to}} feed hens in the rain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] Lord Lambeth rejoined, [...] "you {{see people}} at London parties <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they couldn't speak if they tried." ...|$|R
6000|$|True, he hadn't {{thought of}} that. He had no cards. He {{received}} {{one from the}} clerk <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had done duty before, and scrawled his name upon it, {{and gave it to}} the insolent little darky who served as [...] "Front." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prink half an hour, {{and put on}} her wad," [...] {{answered}} the irreverent Tom, whose preparations for school consisted in flinging his cap on to his head, and strapping up several big books, <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were sometimes used as weapons of defence.|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes more}} found them {{again on the}} way, and now Songbird had the large lights turned on, which made the roadway ahead as bright as day.

5000|$|... "Speed Demon" [...] - {{lines at}} the bottom of the screen <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are from a VHS are briefly seen at the end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{somebody}} {{had come up}} the fire-escape {{and got into the}} rooms that way," [...] said Jack, when he heard of this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is this outlet?" [...] asked Deerslayer; [...] "I see no {{opening in}} the banks or the trees, <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it would let a river like the Susquehannah run through it." ...|$|R
60|$|They had now {{to advance}} with more caution than ever, and {{several days later}} came to some open water <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it would bar all further progress. The lead was six or seven hundred feet wide, and ran east and west as far as eye could reach.|$|E
60|$|It {{seems that}} they had luncheon somewhere together. She {{did not take the}} trouble to inquire where she was: an old-fashioned hotel somewhere in Kensington, with table-cloths <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been used for several {{previous}} luncheons, and foreign waiters who wore weird-looking shoes and trousers frayed at the edges.|$|E
6000|$|... “I know this: Less than an {{hour ago}} we met two fellows on the river, one with a hamper {{and the other with}} a bundle <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was done up in an {{overcoat}} turned inside out. We came on the fellows rather suddenly, at a turn where there were some bushes.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so. But in {{the letter}} he speaks of the two pairs of shoes I took away with me. <b>That</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{somebody}} had gotten two pairs of shoes in my name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Look {{over your}} safe very carefully. You may {{discover}} something to your advantage,'" [...] repeated Tom. [...] "Say! <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> somebody {{knew something about}} the robbery!" [...] he went on, excitedly.|$|R
2500|$|... "Anti-gravity" [...] {{is often}} used colloquially to refer to devices <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means, such as lifters, which fly in the air by moving air with {{electromagnetic}} fields.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you are pale, too. Dear me! I'm {{afraid you}} took cold that morning," [...] said Mrs. Sepulvida. [...] "I should never forgive myself if you did. I should cry my eyes out!" [...] and Donna Maria cast a {{dangerous}} look {{from under her}} slightly swollen lids <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they might threaten a deluge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what do you}} want?" [...] and {{he turned}} to the next person. This was {{a young man in a}} seedy red cravat and a pimply face, <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was going to seed likewise, who, with a mysterious tapping of his vest-pocket and other hints, made a great show of having {{something}} confidential to communicate.|$|E
6000|$|Amy {{looked at}} Mrs. Rowe, a very clean woman, {{but with a}} face and fists <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been {{cut out of the}} toughest part of an old pollard ash, and a mouth that shut up like the snap of a gin. [...] "Poor little fellow!" [...] said Amy, and in she went.|$|E
6000|$|... "I may be mistaken, but <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it might}} be Porton," [...] said Dave to himself. [...] "However, I'll soon know;" [...] and he {{increased}} his speed {{so that he might}} catch up to the other walker.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look, Jim, {{over there}} to the right," [...] Jack said. [...] "There is a swarm of men at work. I believe they must be getting up a fresh battery there. <b>That</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the Egyptians had {{made up their minds}} to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me a story," [...] {{said the}} Baroness, staring out despairingly at the rain; {{it was that}} light, apologetic sort of rain <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it was going to}} leave off every minute and goes on for the greater part of the afternoon.|$|R
60|$|However, Kate {{recovered}} {{the use of}} her limbs and tongue in a moment, and instantly took her prisoner's hand, and ran off {{with her to the}} corner where the scenery of Loch Katrine had so often been begun, and began with great animation to explain. This--a hole <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> an old hen had been grubbing in it--was Loch Katrine.|$|E
60|$|I acquiesced, {{and made}} a sign for my {{companion}} to proceed. Susquesus {{was a man of}} action, and not of words; and, in a minute he was leading the way toward a spot in the woods <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it might contain the bed of the stream that was known to exist somewhere near by, since it was laid down on the map.|$|E
60|$|Having cut several pine boughs <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they might}} answer the purpose, the four boys lost {{no time in}} {{twisting}} them together and then tying them into a rude litter. Across this they laid additional pine boughs, and upon these placed {{the form of the}} hurt man. When they moved him he shut his teeth hard, evidently to keep from crying out with pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! it {{is down to}} the sea he is with <b>that</b> child <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{was made}} of air, and lived on live larks! And Master Lance, he's no better-—eats like a sparrow, and sits up half the night writing for his paper." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Mr. Cratty is an {{authoritative}} and intelligent dancer {{with lots of}} stage presence, qualities his choreography shares. What a rarity it is to see dance today <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it knew where it were going, even when, {{as was the case}} here, it is full of surprises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{wonderful}} place," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but I don't understand how they do the business here. Whom do all these goods belong to? {{and how do they}} sell them? We have not seen any body here <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was buying any thing." ...|$|R
