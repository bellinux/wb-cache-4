500|$|Once the Persian {{forces in}} Europe had largely been neutralised, the Athenians {{seem to have}} gone about {{starting}} to extend the League in Asia Minor. The islands of Samos, Chios and Lesbos seem to have become members of the original Hellenic alliance after Mycale, and presumably were also therefore original members of the Delian League. However, it is unclear exactly when the other Ionian cities, or indeed the other Greek cities of Asia Minor, joined the league, though <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> at some point. Thucydides attests the presence of Ionians at Byzantium in 478 BC, so {{it is possible that}} at least some of the Ionian cities joined the league in early 478 BC. The Athenian politician Aristides was said to have died in Pontus (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into Asia Minor.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} of the immortality, or otherwise long life of Orcs. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> live for {{at the very least}} hundreds of years, since Bolg was the son of Azog and his death occurred over 140 years {{after the death of his}} father. This theory is not inconsistent with a statement made in the [...] "Myths Transformed" [...] essay of Morgoth's Ring that the Orcs had short lifespans in relation to the Númenóreans.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Africa, he {{believed}} that, except for the small stretch {{of land in the}} vicinity of Suez, the continent was in fact surrounded by water. However, he definitely disagreed with his predecessors and contemporaries about its presumed circular shape. He based his theory on the story of Pharaoh Necho II, the ruler of Egypt between 609 and 594 BC, who had sent [...] Phoenicians to circumnavigate Africa. Apparently, it took them three years, but <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> prove his idea. He speculated that the Nile River started as far west as the Ister River in Europe and cut Africa through the middle. He was the first writer to assume that the Caspian Sea was separated from other seas and he recognised northern Scythia as one of the coldest inhabited lands in the world.|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess I'll {{get over}} it," [...] said Jack's father, with a wan smile. [...] "But <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{give it to}} me." [...] Then he gave a sudden start. [...] "What about my papers? Are they safe?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. Still, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{always say}} it. I never minded the barriers; {{but there was}} always a slight shock about the other, unless one was very hard hit indeed.|$|R

60|$|Peter looked, {{and sure}} enough there was a pollywog {{with a pair of}} legs {{sprouting}} out. They were his fore legs, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> make him look funny. And only a few days before there hadn't been a sign of legs.|$|E
60|$|A wish of Grace's aided my application, and Emily {{placed the}} {{ornaments}} around her throat.

6000|$|Sir James {{looked at}} him keenly. [...] "You had worked that out, had you? Not bad--not at all bad.

6000|$|In fact, Knox himself merely {{says that}} he had [...] "reasoned with" [...] pastors and the learned; he does not say that they agreed with him, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not.

60|$|About {{that time}} {{an officer of}} the Berkshire Regiment {{represented}} the condition of his men as requiring attention. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> require it, for they had been without food since four o'clock that morning, and were consequently in urgent need of provender as well as rest and water--the last having been all consumed.|$|E
60|$|And, by Jove, they did! <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> by George!

6000|$|... "They {{signed the}} other deed; that is {{two of them}} did.

60|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> so, {{for more}} bear steaks were {{laid on the}} embers, and while one of the newcomers, {{stripping}} a cartridge, rubbed powder grains into the flesh another produced {{a few of the}} fern roots which in times of scarcity the Siwash Indians eat.

50|$|Having {{been erected}} by unskilled workforce, the gardens present fine {{specimens}} of art naïf and art brut, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> possess the characteristic childish spontaneity {{and sense of}} wonder.

Yet, once again, the monumental scale of the projects and the long-term, communal, organized nature of construction are quite remarkable for the realm of outsider art.|$|R
5000|$|... "a {{vast amount}} of stone cutting has been {{accomplished}} .... The carvings on the spandrels of the chief entrance are exceedingly fine. They comprise the national emblems of the three United Kingdoms - the rose, the thistle, and the shamrock disposed on either side by an ancient lyre. These carvings together with the fine bearded face which forms the keystone of the arch photo above are the work of Mr Thomas, contractor for the stone cutting and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> him very great credit".|$|R
60|$|The {{newcomers}} were evidently {{bewildered by}} this reception.

6000|$|... [373] A {{very common}} but random opinion traces Rousseau's {{insanity}} to certain disagreeable habits avowed in the Confessions. They {{may have contributed}} in some small degree to depression of vital energies, though for that matter Rousseau's strength and power of endurance were remarkable to the end. But <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not produce a mental state in the least corresponding to that particular variety of insanity, which possesses definitely marked features.|$|E
60|$|If {{the people}} did not hear Zat Arrras' charge, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> hear the verdict of the tribunal. A sullen murmur rose louder and louder about the packed coliseum, and then Kantos Kan, who had not left the {{platform}} since first he had taken his place near me, raised his hand for silence. When he could be heard {{he spoke to the}} people in a cool and level voice.|$|E
2500|$|Lange was a {{supporter}} of changing New Zealand's flag, and wrote in 1994: [...] " [...] stranger who saw the Australian flag and the New Zealand flag outside adjacent buildings would assume that some British hotel chain was advertising deluxe and standard rooms".

5000|$|Although {{he would}} be accused of {{claiming}} heterosexuals have no AIDS risk, the back cover of his AIDS book states, [...] "The 'myth' of heterosexual AIDS consists {{of a series of}} myths, one of which is not that heterosexuals get AIDS. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> get it[...] [...] [...]" [...] Rather, he argued that while white middle-class heterosexuals were the target of AIDS propaganda, [...] "the profile of the typical victim of heterosexually transmitted AIDS is a lower-class black woman who is the regular sex partner of an IV drug user." ...|$|R
5000|$|Farmers {{do not get}} any of {{the higher}} price under Fairtrade.

[...] Farmers do, however,incur extra costs in producing Fairtrade, so <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> lose money from Fairtrade membership in some cases. There is little or no research on the extra costs incurred, or the effect of Fairtrade membership on the income of farmers.|$|R
