Relatively high temperature of exhaust has caused a vast waste of energy and serious environmental <b>thermal</b> <b>pollutions.</b> To make a full and reasonable use of the heat resource, a simplified single-tube heat exchanger is introduced in this paper. Dry air and wet air with different temperatures transfer heat with flue gas in the same model. And the results show that heat near the inner wall exchanges more violently than any other space in the heater. For dry air, the higher temperature of the air enters into the heater, the lower heat transfer effect of the heater. Heat exchange effect of the wet air with 0. 03 mole fraction of water is more higher than that of dry air in this model...|$|R

30|$|Inorganic, {{organic and}} <b>thermal</b> <b>pollutions</b> {{have led to}} {{accelerate}} {{the deterioration of the}} freshwater resources (Khound and Bhattacharyya 2016; Qadir et al. 2008). Contaminants related to urban and agricultural runoff are the primary sources of non-point pollution. Industrial and municipal effluents which comprised organic and inorganic chemicals are directly or indirectly discharged into water bodies and constitute the punctual point sources of contamination (Allan and Castillo 2007). Toxic inorganic chemicals are also released from weathering of rocks, carried by runoff into water bodies and/or percolate into groundwater (Li and Zhang 2010). Among inorganic toxic chemicals, heavy metals are of greater concern. These are highly persistent, ubiquitous, non-biodegradable, accumulate and biomagnify in food chain and have cumulative effects in human (Hashmi et al. 2012). Other inorganic materials, such as, acids, salts and chlorine which are not toxic at low concentrations may become concentrated, deteriorate water quality and adversely affect biological organisms.|$|R

25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (<b>thermal</b> <b>pollution).</b> Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once-through cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|If {{that same}} plant had no cooling tower and used {{once-through}} cooling water, {{it would require}} about 100,000 cubic metres an hour A large cooling water intake typically kills millions of fish and larvae annually, as the organisms are impinged on the intake screens. A large amount of water {{would have to be}} continuously returned to the ocean, lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant. Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see <b>thermal</b> <b>pollution),</b> or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae. A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.|$|E

25|$|Intensive {{exploitation}} of lake resources and habitat destruction resulted in marked decrease in fish production so that commercial operations were halted and recreational fishing is presently limited {{to catch and}} release. Years of construction activity on the lake's limited watershed resulted in lowered water levels. Heavy metals (aluminium, chromium, arsenic, and copper) dissolved in the water {{as a result of}} coal burning were deemed to be at acceptable levels, but metals in sediment and mercury in larger pike were found to be excessive. TransAlta responded with measures to reduce metal and <b>thermal</b> <b>pollution,</b> and the Wabamun power plant was decommissioned and torn down. As a result of the Canadian National Railway oil spill, fish from the lake are not recommended for consumption. Walleye have not been seen in the lake since the early 1900s when they were fished out. Several attempts to restock walleye in the lake failed because the Wabamun power plant (built in the 1950s) discharged its heated cooling water into the lake, keeping that portion of the lake clear of ice. Walleye would spawn in the warm water weeks prior to their normal spawning time and the hatchlings did not survive when they could not find enough food in the still-cold portions of the lake. After closure of the Wabamun power plant in 2010, Alberta Fish and Wildlife attempted another stocking of walleye, and this one appears to have been successful. Walleye are reproducing and so are their young. TransAlta no longer uses the lake for any of its operations.|$|E

The purpose of this work is to define a methodology for the analysis of the surface temperature maps of coastal waterbodies and watercourses from satellite images for quality assessment and for regulatory purposes. Three different procedures are developed in order to study the temperature field of waterbodies, to extract the temperature profile at a fixed distance from the coastline and to analyse the cross sections of the watercourses as prescribed by the law. Extraction and analysis of surface temperature patterns are undertaken using image segmentation techniques. This work also represents a first test of the advantages given by the Sharpening Water Thermal Imagery (SWTI) algorithm, which improves the spatial resolution of Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images from 90 to 30 m.

40|$|Mobile {{gas turbine}} plants (MGTP) {{are the key}} sources of power {{designated}} to improve the safety of power supply in case of power deficit. In Russia, their pilot launch was initiated 5 - 6 years ago, and since then, they have demonstrated their high efficiency. In view of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games, organizations responsible for continuous power supply have resolved to build three MGTPs in Sochi. As Sochi {{is located in the}} natural area of preferential protection that has been granted Federal significance, construction and operation of the aforementioned facilities requires a detailed geo-environmental due diligence. Significant efforts have been exerted to substantiate the accommodation of MGTPs in three different sites and to identify the maximal number of power generators per site with account for the ecological restrictions imposed onto the natural areas of preferential protection. The impact produced by MGTPs on the environment depends on their technological features and the appropriate natural and anthropogenic properties of their sites and adjacent lands. Therefore, selection of new sites must be backed by the assessment of negative consequences. This requirement applies mainly to recreational lands. Recent sources report that the principal factors of negative impact of MGTPs include the chemical pollution of the ambient air and the noise pollution of residential buildings located in the immediate proximity to MGTPs. Factors of secondary importance include the pollution of surface and underground waters, soils, intrusion into the geological environment, production of waste, <b>thermal</b> and electromagnetic <b>pollutions.</b> The authors assess different factors of impact produced by MGTPs on the environment. As a result of the geo-ecological due diligence it has been discovered that the maximal number of power generators per site must not exceed 2 - 4, if the oxide emission technology is employed. At the same time, failure to employ the above technology must prevent any MGTPs from being installed there. Noise pollution assessments have demonstrated that acceptable noise intensity will be exceeded at the distance of up to 300 meters from the MGTP. Therefore, construction of MGTPs requires noise protection arrangements, for example, installation of specialized noise-absorbing fences or screens. It is noteworthy that soil pollution, geological environment <b>pollution,</b> <b>thermal</b> and electromagnetic <b>pollution</b> may be disregarded due to inconsiderable period of time while MGTPs are in operation. Adjusted calculations and assessments are to be made at the stage of the project development. Выявлены возможности размещения МГТЭС на трех площадках г.
