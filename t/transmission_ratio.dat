2500|$|Steam was {{replaced}} by Class 37s, working in pairs. [...] Other classes that appeared include Hymeks. The Hymeks allocated to Lickey banking duties were modified so that the lowest <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio</b> was inoperative, despite the requirement for high tractive effort. The reason for this modification was that the typical speed of a train ascending the bank was approximately that at which the transmission would change between first and second gear, and so it tended to [...] "hunt" [...] between the two. The repeated gear changes under full power caused excessive wear and damage, and {{the simplest way to}} avoid the problem was to lock first gear out of action, so the locomotives used only second gear and upwards.|$|E

[...] "The 20% <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{laboratory}} laser eyewear would probably have disastrous effects on a cockpit crew who must read instruments while flying at night.... The optical quality of such systems also becomes a factor because slight amounts of distortion or haze which may be of no concern in the laboratory may be a major concern to pilots flying at low altitudes and high speed." [...] Also, {{there may be a}} variety of laser wavelengths/colors that may need to be defended against. If all wavelengths are protected, the goggles essentially are opaque. There are also issues with the discomfort of wearing goggles routinely, given that laser incidents are relatively rare.|$|E

30|$|Obviously, {{to each of}} {{different}} IC engine powered vehicles in application, the most-used working states and the most-desired working states could be very different. It {{is a challenge to}} develop a one-stage gear <b>transmission</b> of multiple <b>ratios</b> with high efficiency to execute the proposed propulsion method as it must be compact in volume and light in weight as well as convenient in operation. Since the <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios</b> are uncertain for each of the customers based on the case-emphasized propulsion method, it is difficult to have a <b>transmission</b> with multiple <b>ratios</b> {{to meet the needs of}} all IC engine control of a vehicle in general. More critically, the uncertain <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios</b> cannot conduct the way of mass production to achieve the cost-effectiveness of engineering.|$|R

In miniaturized magnetic gears, solid steel is strongly preferred over the laminated one considering manufacturability. This paper investigates the iron losses of four miniaturized magnetic gears having different <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios,</b> intended for a same application. The iron loss distributions throughout the different magnetic gear cores are identified, {{for which it is}} demonstrated that their proportions vary with <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios.</b> In relation to that, recommendations on the use of a steel type are also given...|$|R

50|$|In addition, as the {{transmission}} diameter is increased, the chain {{has to be}} pushed up the inclined surfaces of the pulley halves of the variator pulley, while {{the tension in the}} chain tends to pull the chain towards the opposite direction. Hence a large force, which is larger than the tension in the chain, is required to change {{the transmission}} diameter. Since the <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio</b> has to be changed within less than one full rotation of the variator pulley, a large force has to be applied on the pulley halves within a very short duration. If for example the variator pulley rotates at 3600 rpm, which is equivalent to 60 revolutions per second, then the force required to change the <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio</b> has to be applied within 1/60 seconds. This would be similar to hitting something with a hammer. Therefore, here significant shock loads are applied to the variator pulley during <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio</b> change that increases the transmission diameter. These shock loads may cause comfort problems for the driver of the vehicle using an iCVT. Also an iCVT has to be designed as to be able to resist these shock loads which would most likely increases the cost and weight of an iCVT.|$|E

The paper explains the problems arising in this case and how the design approach can be modified with respect to a rectangular operating range. A graphical method is proposed, which permits the designer to exclude some drive systems and, for each of the others, to find a range of <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios</b> that can certainly be coupled with the motor and/or a range of <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios</b> for which the analysis must be deepened...|$|R

50|$|Micra's new-generation Xtronic CVT {{features}} a new structure combining a belt-operated CVT with an auxiliary two-speed transmission. The CVT raises the <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio</b> {{by more than}} 20% compared to other CVTs in its class, providing enhanced responsiveness on starting and acceleration and improved quietness during high-speed driving. With the auxiliary transmission, the size and weight of the CVT unit is significantly reduced. Friction is reduced by about 30% compared to other CVTs in its class, achieved by the increased <b>transmission</b> <b>ratio,</b> reduced pulley size and weight, and reduced oil agitating resistance - helping improve fuel economy. An electric oil pump is adopted in vehicles equipped with Idling Stop. Quicker oil pressure response improves startup performance and thus contributes to an improvement in fuel economy. While Idling Stop is in operation, pulley rotation is temporarily locked inside the CVT and is slowly unlocked when the engine starts again. This prevents reverse movement during a hill start and enables smooth startup.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel variable transmission {{system that is}} based on the concept of digital hydraulics. In the proposed system, sets of rolling-diaphragm cylinders are mounted via different effective lever arms to an input and output joint. A variable subset of these cylinders is connected via three-way two-position on/off valves to a common hydraulic manifold. This introduces a controllable constraint on the hydraulic flow and creates a programmable hydraulic transmission. With three single-acting cylinders, we could realize 37 different <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios.</b> We investigated the nonholonomic flow constraint analytically, in simulation, and with an experimental prototype. Using water as fluid, we show that a very stiff transmission (124. 2 Nm/rad) can be achieved within the range of ± 6 ◦. Theoretical <b>transmission</b> <b>ratios</b> are tracked with R-squared values of more than 0. 996 and backlash is smaller than 1. 4 %. Furthermore, we show the applicability of the proposed transmission in the simulation of a body-powered knee-ankle exoskeleton. I...|$|R
