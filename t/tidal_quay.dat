50|$|The town {{is divided}} into two parts, the main town of Fishguard and Lower Fishguard. Lower Fishguard (locally known as 'Lower Town') is {{believed}} to be the site of the original hamlet from which modern Fishguard has grown. It is situated in a deep valley where the River Gwaun meets the sea, hence the Welsh name for Fishguard. It is a typical fishing village with a short <b>tidal</b> <b>quay.</b> The settlement stretches along the north slope of the valley.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village was}} {{originally}} a planned town built in 1810 on a <b>tidal</b> <b>quay</b> wall and named {{at that time}} [...] "New Glanmire". It is served by the commuter railway line between Cork and Cóbh. The next station in the Cork direction is Little Island, while towards Cóbh the next stop is at Fota Island. With the reopening, in 2009, of the railway line to Midleton, Glounthaune railway station became the junction between the Cóbh and Midleton lines.|$|E
50|$|The second lowest port on the Taw is Fremington. Between {{the mid-19th}} and mid-20th centuries its <b>tidal</b> <b>quay</b> was the busiest port (tonnage) between Bristol and Lands End, mainly {{as it was}} a handy landing point for Welsh coal shipped across the Bristol Channel which could be {{distributed}} around the south-west peninsula by train (track finally closed 1987). The lowest port (or at least jetty) can be found at Yelland. The site of a coal-fired power station (closed 1984; demolished 1989), it still is used as a tanker-distribution centre for commercial and domestic petrol and diesel deliveries. The oil storage tanks here are filled from coastal lighters.|$|E
50|$|The docks are {{operated}} as the Port of King's Lynn by Associated British Ports. It handles around 750,000 tonnes {{of cargo}} a year, including agricultural and forest products, chemicals, steel and other metals. Three docks, including the <b>tidal</b> Riverside <b>Quay,</b> can accommodate vessels up to 140 m in length. The docks cover {{an area of}} 39 ha and include the 25,000 tonne capacity Alexandra Grain Silo complex.|$|R
50|$|The south {{terminal}} {{with approximately}} 80 ha {{consists of the}} Normandy terminal with the Asia and Osaka wharf:They are located before the lock in a <b>tidal</b> basin.The 2 <b>quays</b> offer a capacity of 1075 M dredged at 14 M. It is a private terminal :The yard facilities and the quay equipment belong to the company SETN. It is equipped with 5 super overpanamax gantry cranes.|$|R
500|$|Authority for {{the river}} remains {{much as it was}} after 1896, with the Littlehampton Harbour Board {{responsible}} for the section from the mouth up to Arundel Bridge, and no navigation authority {{for the river}} above that, although the Environment Agency have responsibility for its drainage functions. There are nine bridges with a minimum navigable headroom of between [...] and [...] at high water. The river is <b>tidal</b> to Pallingham <b>Quay,</b> [...] upstream from the sea at Littlehampton, and flows at , {{making it one of the}} fastest flowing rivers in the country. The tidal range at Littlehampton is [...] at spring tides and [...] at neap tides. High tide occurs 15 minutes later than high water at Dover, and high water at Pulborough is four hours later than at Littlehampton.|$|R
5000|$|Haverfordwest rapidly grew, {{initially}} {{around the}} castle and St Martin's Church (the settlement being called Castletown), then spreading into the High Street area. It immediately became {{the capital of}} the hundred of Roose (part of Little England beyond Wales), and because of its pivotal position, the commercial centre of western Dyfed, which it has remained to this day. In common with other British towns, its growth was rapid during the period up to 1300, and its extent by then was much {{the same as it was}} in the early 19th century. That being the case, its population was probably around 4,000-5,000 - a large town by the standards of the time. It received its first marcher charter from William Marshall, 1st Earl of Pembroke some time between 1213 and 1219, and obtained the lucrative trading privileges of an English borough. It traded both by land and sea, and had a busy <b>tidal</b> <b>quay</b> on the river below the [...] "New" [...] Bridge. At least ten guilds operated, and there was significant woollen cloth manufacture. On 30 April 1479, the town was designated a county corporate by a charter of Edward, Prince of Wales, with the aim of supporting a campaign against piracy in local waters. It shared this distinction only with Carmarthen and a few towns in England, and remained officially [...] "The Town and County of Haverfordwest" [...] until the abolition of the borough in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Authority for {{the river}} remains {{much as it was}} after 1896, with the Littlehampton Harbour Board {{responsible}} for the section from the mouth up to Arundel Bridge, and no navigation authority {{for the river}} above that, although the Environment Agency have responsibility for its drainage functions. There are nine bridges with a minimum navigable headroom of between 8 ft and 5 ft at high water. The river is <b>tidal</b> to Pallingham <b>Quay,</b> 25.5 mi upstream from the sea at Littlehampton, and flows at , {{making it one of the}} fastest flowing rivers in the country. The tidal range at Littlehampton is 17 ft at spring tides and 8.8 ft at neap tides.

2500|$|Morwellham Quay {{is on the}} River Tamar, and {{although}} it is about [...] from the sea, the river is still <b>tidal</b> there. The <b>quay</b> was the furthest point inland to which the river was navigable, and it had served Tavistock as a port since the twelfth century. Ships of 200 tons were using the quay by 1800, {{and there was a}} growing trade in copper, which was being mined locally, particularly since the Wheal Friendship mine had opened around 1797. In 1802, John Taylor, a local civil engineer with interests in the mining of metal ores, surveyed the route for a canal to run from Tavistock to Morwellham, and it was discussed at a meeting held in March 1803 in Tavistock. The canal would be [...] wide and [...] deep, and the Millhill slate quarries would be served by a branch from the main line. It would carry copper ore, both the Wheal Friendship and the Wheal Crowndale mine which had recently opened nearer to Tavistock. Other cargo would include slate, limestone and general goods. The canal would be suitable for tub-boats, and would be built entirely on land owned by the Duke of Bedford, who approved of the project. The estimated cost was £40,000, which included provision for testing any mineral lodes which were found during its construction, and the rights to those minerals, together with dues payable to the Duke for their extraction, were negotiated before the project began.|$|R
