40|$|Photograph of {{electric}} cars of the Municipal Railway passing under a bridge within a crowded city, San Francisco, ca. 1920. At center, {{a group of}} three trolley cars can be seen moving {{along the side of the}} road. The trolley at the front of the line features eleven windows and two entrances along its side. Three windows span the face of the car. Above the windows, a small sign reads "Car House". Below the windows, a small sign and number lie adjacent to a single headlight. A large bench is also attached to the front of the trolley. On top of each car, a long metallic rod connects the <b>trolley</b> to a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> above. Several wires stretch across the sky connected to various poles and structures. To the right of the line of trolleys, a large crowd of people stand beside a building. Many of the people are seen entering the trolleys. In the extreme foreground, a car is seen to the right and running children to the left. In the background to the left, another trolley can be seen. In the background at center, several signs are seen along the bridge and in the background. Legible signs from left to right read: "Welcome Stranger", "Genuine Bull Durham Tobacco", "Orpheum Theatre Vaudeville", "When you write letters to your friends outside California ask them to stop at least ten days in San Francisco.

50|$|A {{telephone}} system {{only has to}} make a one-to-one connection. Intuitively this seems to mean that the number of inputs and the number of outputs can always be equal in each subswitch, but intuition does not prove this can be done nor does it tell us how to do so. Suppose we want to synthesize a 16 by 16 crossbar switch. The design could have 4 subswitches on the input side, each with 4 inputs, for 16 total inputs. Further, on the output side, we could also have 4 output subswitches, each with 4 outputs, for a total of 16 outputs. It is desirable that the design use as few wires as possible, because wires cost real money. The least possible number of wires that can connect two subswitches is a <b>single</b> <b>wire.</b> So, each input subswitch will have a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> to each middle subswitch. Also, each middle subswitch will have a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> to each output subswitch.|$|R

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} for predicting {{the behavior of a}} magnetic filter. A magnetic filter mainly consists of a non-magnetic casing filled with ferromagnetic wire nets. The filter unit is introduced into a magnetic field to magnetize the wires. The strong magnetic field gradients {{in the vicinity of the}} wires give rise to a magnetic force which attracts particles with a sufficient magnetic quality in the direction of the wire surface. Magnetic filtration was applied for the separation of heavy metal precipitates. Due to the insufficient magnetic quality of the heavy metal hydroxides a flocculation process with magnetite particles has to be performed to make magnetite-bearing agglomerates which are easily magnetically separable. The fundamental equation describing the filter breakthrough results from the macroscopic conservation equation and the rate equation. The two filter constants incorporated can be predicted with <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> models which describes the particle attachment process inside the filter. To verify the models a test facility was developed which allowed the visual observation of the attachment of particles to a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> by microscope. The particle tracks and the attachment zones around a magnetized <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> were measured by an image analyzing system. Thus, the results of theoretical calculation could be checked directly against experimental findings. The calculations were based upon two essential innovations: A new solution of the equation of particle motion at creeping flow conditions and a new expression describing the connection between the floc susceptibility and the floc size. In addition to the study of particle motion at <b>single</b> <b>wires</b> filter experiments were performed. With the filter constants resulting from the improved <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> models the calculation of the filter breakthrough was possible. (orig.)
