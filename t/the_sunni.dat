5|$|Over {{the course}} of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been {{alternately}} neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing {{its status as a}} congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Academics {{suggest the}} Alevi {{population}} may be from 15 to 20 million, while the Alevi-Bektaşi Federation claims {{that there are}} around 25 million and according to Aksiyon magazine, the number of Shiite Twelvers (excluding Alevis) is 3 million (4.2 percent). Under <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Islamist government of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Tayyip Erdoğan, an increasing discrimination against and persecution of the Alevi minority has begun.|$|E
5|$|According to Shia scholar Mohammad Jafar Tabasi, {{the graves}} of Shia Imams buried in al-Baqi had been revered and since {{hundreds}} of years ago and none of <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> scholars ulamas regarded the shrines as innovation. Weeks before the second demolition, at the request of Ibn Bulayhid, a group of fifteen scholars from Medina unanimously issued a fatwa (an Islamic legal ruling) condemning the making of mausoleums around the graves.|$|E

5|$|Although the Ayyubids {{were from}} the Shafi'i denomination, they built schools for imparting {{instruction}} in all four of <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> systems of religious-juridical thought. Before the Ayyubid takeover, there were no schools for the Hanbali and Maliki denominations in Syria, but the Ayyubids founded separate schools for them. In the mid-13th century, Ibn Shaddad counted in Damascus 40 Shafi'i, 34 Hanafi, 10 Hanbali, and three Maliki schools.|$|E
5|$|Caliph al-Mu’izz li-Din Allāh, {{the fourth}} Ismāʿīli Imam, conquered Egypt through his general Gawhar, wresting it from <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Ikhshidid dynasty. By {{order of the}} Caliph, Gawhar then oversaw the {{construction}} of the royal enclosure of the Fatimid Caliphate and its army, and had al-Azhar built as a base to spread Ismāʿīli Shi'a Islam. Located near the densely populated Sunni city of Fustat, Cairo became the center of the Ismāʿīli sect of Shi'a Islam, and seat of the Fatimid empire.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah has close {{relations}} with Iran. It also has {{ties with the}} leadership in Syria, specifically President Hafez al-Assad (until his death in 2000) supported it.

Although Hezbollah and Hamas are not organizationally linked, Hezbollah provides military training as well as financial and moral support to <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Palestinian group. Furthermore, Hezbollah is {{a strong supporter of}} the ongoing Al-Aqsa Intifada.|$|E

5|$|The Shia {{majority}} {{ruled by}} <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Al khalifa family since {{the eighteenth century}} have long complained {{of what they call}} systemic discrimination.

5|$|Violence {{continued}} through {{the last months of}} 2011. In September, a bus carrying Shia pilgrims from neighboring Karbala Governorate was stopped outside of Ramadi and 22 were executed, prompting threats from Karbala to annex parts of southern Anbar Province, including the city of Nukhayb.

5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} Hindu-Muslim {{co-operation}} {{was necessary for}} political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Islamic Caliph in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The Fatimid dynasty was {{succeeded by}} {{the rule of}} Saladin and his Ayyubid dynasty. Initially {{appointed}} vizier by the last Fatimid Caliph Al-'Āḍid (who incorrectly thought he could be easily manipulated), Saladin consolidated power in Egypt, allying that country with <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Distrusting al-Azhar for its Shi'a history, the mosque lost prestige during his rule. However, the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque, overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs. Among the restorations was a modification of the mihrab, with the installation of a polychrome marble facing.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E

5|$|Al-Azhar {{nevertheless}} {{remained the}} seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are reports that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, the policies of <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers {{as a way of}} combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.|$|E
5|$|The Iraq War in Anbar Province, {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with improvised explosive devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} had both served as the multazim (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, <b>the</b> <b>Sunni</b> Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became {{the head of the}} family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that {{in the event of a}} default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.|$|E
