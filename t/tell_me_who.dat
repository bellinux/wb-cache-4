500|$|In {{a modern}} {{development}} of the tale the green children {{are associated with the}} Babes in the Wood, who were left by their wicked uncle to die; in this version the children's green colouration is explained by their having been poisoned with arsenic. Fleeing from the wood in which they were abandoned, possibly nearby Thetford Forest, the children fell into the pits at Woolpit where they were discovered. Local author and folk singer Bob Roberts states in his 1978 book A Slice of Suffolk that [...] "I was told there are still people in Woolpit who are 'descended from the green children', but nobody would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> they were!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. It is the opening track from their 1983 album War and was {{released}} as the album's third single on 11 March 1983 in Germany and the Netherlands. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies. One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters and bystanders. At the same time, the lyrics reject hate and revenge as a response, {{as noted in the}} line [...] "There's many lost, but <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> has won." [...] Along with [...] "New Year's Day," [...] the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release.|$|E
500|$|The New York Dolls and Morton {{produced}} little original material {{together and}} had to record cover songs and re-recorded some of the band's earlier demos to complete Too Much Too Soon; [...] "Babylon", [...] "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", [...] "It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Human Being" [...] had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, [...] "Teenage News" [...] and [...] "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither were considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling {{he had been in}} a rush: [...] "He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{instrumental}} {{features a}} [...] "pop melody and fizzing electronics" [...] while Candy sings the lyrics: [...] "Time keeps on wasting, but I'm {{too high to}} be wasting with all this yolo and rap shit, my heart is elastic". Noisey's Daisy Jones interpreted the words as a reference to Australian singer Sia's 2013 single [...] "Elastic Heart", {{who served as the}} executive producer of Daddy Issues. The song continues with the lyrics: [...] "Living for the days, living for the nights, living for the chance to give what's right, now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> the hell you think I am." [...] During the song's hook, Candy sings [...] "Why do all the good girls have to die/ Living in a bad girl's paradise"; Yasmeen Gharnit wrote that the section discusses how women must discard their innocence to achieve independence. Other parts include: [...] "Go buy a life that's fantastic cause all you are is your assets” and [...] "You can't buy love without passion / So please don't do nothing drastic".|$|E
500|$|In Homilies on Ecclesiastes, he wrote: [...] "'I got me slave-girls and slaves.' For what price, tell me? What did {{you find}} in {{existence}} {{worth as much as}} this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> <b>Who</b> is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Joe Henry, with the former two also {{producing}} it. Ahmadzaï also provided programming, acoustic guitars and keyboards, while Michel Colombier arranged strings. It was composed using common time in the key of D major, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of G3 to the higher note of A4. Sonically, [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was considered [...] "a country meets dance" [...] track with trip hop beats infused with an acoustic [...] "folksy" [...] riff. During an interview for Interview Magazine, in March 2001, Madonna discussed the lyrics, stating, [...] "To me it is a romantic song. Just, you know, rip my skin off, do not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> I should love, or how I should love. Don’t tell me to give up. To me, in a way it’s like that Frank Sinatra song, 'If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere'." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} Assembly Speaker, Brown was {{diagnosed}} with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that still has no cure and that would slowly steal his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, [...] "Having RP is a challenge, as Speaker of the Assembly {{it was very important}} that I recognize people in the halls of the Legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were right in front of me. I needed to have the security people give me notes to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use more of your brain function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands." [...] Brown has worked with the Foundation Fighting Blindness to raise awareness of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E
