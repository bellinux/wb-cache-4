In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing.|$|E

[...] He organized the first national trapshooting organization, a forerunner to today's Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA). Sousa remained active in the fledgling ATA for some time after its formation. Some credit Sousa as the father of organized trapshooting in United States. He also wrote numerous articles about trapshooting. Sousa was a regular competitor representing the United States Navy in trapshooting competitions, particularly against the United States Army. [...] Available records indicate that Sousa registered more than 35,000 targets during his shooting career. A quote from his Trapshooting Hall of Fame biography says it best: [...] "Let me say <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the sweetest music to me is when I call, 'pull,' the old gun barks, and the referee in perfect key announces, 'dead'." ...|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} of Yellow Submarine in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner {{described}} [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as {{the only one of}} the new songs that appeared [...] "to have taken more than a few hours to write". He added: [...] " [...] highlights include some searing Velvet Underground feedback and an unusually witty epigram <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> sums up the Spirit of '67: Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea." [...] Rodriguez recognises the timing of the song's release on its public perception. While he notes that the recording was [...] "positively anarchic" [...] in mid-1967, by 1969, when it received widespread release, the song was [...] "slightly less groundbreaking and a little more reactionary to the psychedelic movement that the band itself had helped popularize".|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{topic of}} the song itself is perhaps how two {{struggling}} musicians (Duritz and bassist Marty Jones of The Himalayans) [...] "want to be big stars," [...] believing that [...] "when everybody loves me, I will never be lonely." [...] Duritz would later recant these values, and in later concert appearances, [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] was played in a subdued acoustic style, if at all. On the live CD Across a Wire Duritz changes the lyrics [...] "We all wanna be big, big stars, but we got different reasons for that" [...] to [...] "We all wanna be big, big stars, but then we get second thoughts about that," [...] and [...] "when everybody loves you, sometimes <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> as funky as you can be" [...] to [...] "when everybody loves you, sometimes <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> as fucked up as you can be." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Music journalist Sam Richards {{rated the}} song four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a twinkling '90s alt. rock ballad- {{a cousin of}} Radiohead's [...] "High and Dry" [...] and Smashing Pumpkins' [...] "1979"- <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> manages to {{keep a lid on}} its impulse to seek out the nearest clifftop." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said [...] "the performance is full of languorous beauty, a gentle understated kind of emotion that seems at odds with the disorientation in the lyrics." [...] Billboard contributor Fred Bronson joked that it was an example of how songs named [...] "Stay" [...] reach the Hot 100, following similarly named hits by Big Mountain, The Four Seasons, Shakespears Sister, and Jodeci. Robert Levine of Spin called it one of their best songs, saying [...] "They're still obsessed with transcendence, whether it's the kind you find on a Joshua Tree bluff or a [...] "Miami" [...] dance floor. And [...] framed that search in the most intimate of terms, even when they were too jaded to crawl out from under their lemon and look us in the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} Entertainment Weekly, David Browne found Pearl Jam to be derivative of [...] "fellow Northwestern rockers like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and the defunct Mother Love Bone", {{and felt that}} it [...] "goes to show <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything can be harnessed and packaged." [...] NME accused Pearl Jam of [...] "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets." [...] Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts, and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads. Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, gave the album a [...] "B-" [...] and viewed it as another in a [...] "slew of Seattle albums" [...] that [...] "modulate the same misguided ethos", which he said was [...] "hippie" [...] rather than [...] "punk". Christgau described it as [...] "San Francisco ballroom music" [...] whose [...] "distinguishing characteristics" [...] could only be discerned by listeners if they [...] "take the right drugs". He later gave Ten a two-star honorable mention, citing [...] "Once" [...] and [...] "Even Flow" [...] as highlights, and quipped, [...] "in life, abuse justifies melodrama; in music, riffs work better". Charles R. Cross wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that Ten sounded less original and more self-important than Nirvana's Nevermind, but it also showcases the band's intricate guitar style and Vedder's distinctive singing.|$|E

Anyone can open a sleep laboratory, and it seems <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everyone is." [...] On the accreditation process for sleep laboratories, she continues: [...] "This accreditation, however, is currently not required by most states, or more importantly, by most insurance carriers for reimbursements...

A strong leading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising facility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr. Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden. That was what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often, in imagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed by. perspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to the perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.|$|E
