25|$|The silver {{chloride}} electrode is {{most commonly used}} as a reference electrode in pH meters, although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode. The {{silver chloride}} electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The reference electrode usually consists of a platinum wire that has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, {{which serves as a}} contact to the <b>test</b> <b>solution,</b> providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions.|$|E
25|$|Jaroslav Heyrovský, a Nobel laureate, {{eliminated}} the tedious weighing required by previous analytical techniques, which used the differential precipitation of mercury by measuring drop-time. In the previous method, a voltage {{was applied to}} a dropping mercury electrode and a reference electrode was immersed in a <b>test</b> <b>solution.</b> After 50 drops of mercury were collected, they were dried and weighed. The applied voltage was varied and the experiment repeated. Measured weight was plotted versus applied voltage to obtain the curve. In 1921, Heyrovský had the idea of measuring the current flowing through the cell instead of just studying drop-time.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of DFAT testing over reverberant testing is the portability of the DFAT system. This allows {{the test equipment}} to be transported to any location, setup, calibrated, used to perform a High Intensity Acoustic Test and then removed from the test site. The entire process from load-in to load-out can be accomplished in no more than 4 days for a large satellite or similar aerospace structure. The test system uses a “building block” approach to form combinations of equipment to satisfy the environmental requirements. Systems typically include 500 plus speakers, 2 million plus watts of amplification, at least 8 to 16 control microphones, and a closed-loop MIMO acoustic control and data acquisition system. The mobility and “building block” approach allows this method to be tailored for each application {{and to provide a}} more timely and cost effective <b>test</b> <b>solution.</b> This method can also be useful for testing articles that are too large to fit inside a traditional acoustic reverberant chamber.|$|E
2500|$|On {{immersion}} of {{the glass}} electrode and the reference electrode in the <b>test</b> <b>solution,</b> an electrical circuit is completed, {{in which there is}} a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter. The circuit can be thought of as going from the conductive element of the reference electrode to the surrounding potassium-chloride solution, through the ceramic membrane to the <b>test</b> <b>solution,</b> the hydrogen-ion-selective glass {{of the glass}} electrode, to the solution inside the glass electrode, to the silver of the glass electrode, and finally the voltmeter of the display device. The voltage varies from <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> to <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> depending on the potential difference created by the difference in hydrogen-ion concentrations on each side of the glass membrane between the <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> and the solution inside the glass electrode. [...] All other potential differences in the circuit do not vary with pH and are corrected for by means of the calibration.|$|E

This equilibration provides a stable pH measurement.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{two-stage}} {{treatment of}} refined aspen wood fiber with solutions of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and ferrous chloride afforded a filtration medium that {{was effective in}} removing phosphate from <b>test</b> <b>solutions.</b> To assess {{the stability of the}} filtration medium, samples exposed to the <b>test</b> <b>solutions</b> were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. The resultant spectra indicated that a significant amount of the carboxylate functionality, imparted by the CMC, remained with the fiber. Determinations of iron and phosphorous levels in these samples by elemental analysis confirmed that the CMC provided additional sites to complex iron ions, and that phosphate removed from the <b>test</b> <b>solutions</b> was retained within the filtration medium. To better understand the distribution of the CMC in the fiber matrix, treatments were also carried out with CMC containing a polymeric fluorescent dye. Observations by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed partial filling of the fiber lumens. To address concerns related to the hydraulic conductivity of the fibers, aspen wood particles of different sizes were also treated. Results showed that the phosphorous uptake capacity decreased with decreasing particle size. Measurement of iron released into the <b>test</b> <b>solutions</b> suggested that the smaller wood particles may be preferred since they showed the lowest release of iron relative to the amount of phosphate removed...|$|R
