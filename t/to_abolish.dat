5|$|A bill {{proposed}} by Labour peers <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> by-elections (and therefore phase out hereditary peers) was filibustered in 2016 by Conservative hereditary peer Lord Trefgarne.|$|E

5|$|Popery is {{favourable}} to ceremony; {{and among}} the ignorant nations ceremony is the only preservative of tradition. Since Protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland, it has perhaps {{been one of the}} chief labours of the Ministers <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> stated observances, because they continued the remembrance of the former religion.|$|E

He {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>abolishing</b> the carbon tax, to bring down power and gas prices, and <b>to</b> <b>abolishing</b> the mining tax to increase investment and employment. On industrial relations, he promised to [...] "move the workplace relations pendulum back to the sensible centre, restore a strong cop-on-the-beat in the construction industry, and hit dodgy union officials with the same penalties as corporate crooks." ...|$|R
5|$|Since 2002, {{the country}} has seen sectarian {{violence}} by Boko Haram, an Islamist movement that seeks <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the secular system of government and establish Sharia law in the country. In the 2010 Jos riots, more than 500 people were killed by religious violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{life and}} work have been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In Westminster Abbey, a seated statue of Wilberforce by Samuel Joseph was erected in 1840, bearing an epitaph praising his Christian {{character}} and his long labour <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the slave trade and slavery itself.|$|E

5|$|With {{only the}} two years {{remaining}} in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed {{and sent to the}} Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.|$|E
5|$|A 1943 {{attempt by}} Somervell <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the Technical Services failed amid the furor and panic created by false rumors {{that he was}} being {{considered}} for the post of chief of staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. Somervell sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects, such as the Canol Road, which he continued long after the strategic imperative behind it had faded.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E

50|$|In 1823, Ryleyev was {{recruited}} by Ivan Pushchin to the revolutionary Northern Society, {{an organization of}} reform-minded individuals, mainly veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>abolishing</b> serfdom, and replacing the Tsar's government with either a democratic republic or a constitutional monarchy.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>abolishing</b> {{the office}} of Adjutant General, the Legislature also cut all funding for the militia. Despite the efforts of each succeeding Governor, this situation continued for over twenty eight years, until 1907 when the Legislature finally reauthorized {{the office of}} Adjutant General.|$|R
5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with compensation to loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting {{and called for}} secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. This {{would be the}} last attempt <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the council and, as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E

25|$|Rollo is the great-great-great-grandfather of William the Conqueror, or William I of England.

5|$|If that is so, {{it is not}} unthinkable that {{circumstances}} could arise {{where the}} courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism. In exceptional circumstances involving an attempt <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> judicial review or the ordinary role of the courts, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or a new Supreme Court may have to consider {{whether this is a}} constitutional fundamental which even a sovereign Parliament acting at the behest of a complaisant House of Commons cannot abolish.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln won a {{landslide}} re-election in early November 1864 {{on a platform}} advocating passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> slavery altogether, and Booth devoted increasing energy and money to his kidnap plot. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Powell (also known as Lewis Payne or Paine), and John Surratt, a rebel agent. They began to meet routinely at the boarding house of Surratt's mother Mrs. Mary Surratt.|$|E
5|$|Republican {{movements}} in Europe remain active up to present. The most prominent organisations campaigning to eliminate {{one or more}} of Europe's remaining monarchies and/or to liquidate assets reserved for reigning families are affiliated with the Alliance of European Republican Movements, but there are smaller independent initiatives as well, such as Hetis2013 in the Netherlands. Also, some political parties (e.g. Podemos in Spain) have stepped up and called for national referenda <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> monarchies.|$|E

5000|$|A {{range of}} {{amendments}} proposed {{by a small}} minority of pro-death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member states for [...] "a moratorium on executions with a view <b>to</b> <b>abolishing</b> the death penalty".|$|R
50|$|For Kinan, the {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>abolishing</b> sex work is regulating it. Her experience of regulation was the medical exams at Ushuaia, where physicians {{authorized by the}} city ridiculed and disparaged the sex workers they were examining. This combined with similar treatment from clients leads her to place regulators and clients in interlocking roles.|$|R
5|$|Romania {{abolished}} compulsory {{military service}} on October 23, 2006. This came about due to a 2003 constitutional amendment which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The Romanian Parliament voted <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that Romania agreed to when it joined NATO in March 2004.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> the Electoral College by {{constitutional amendment}} {{have been introduced}} in Congress over the decades. These efforts have, however, been hampered {{by the fact that}} a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate are required to send an amendment to the states, where ratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures or by conventions in three fourths of the states is required for it to become operative.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission {{began its}} {{work and the}} {{proceedings}} were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E
