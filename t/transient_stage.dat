When extracting the quenching rate constants using a simple Stern–Volmer analysis, a decrease of the rate constant with increasing driving force is observed above ~ 2 cP.

The consequences on the composition of the gas phase, the deposition rates, and the physicochemical properties of the transient coating layers ( Tr) have been respectively examined by in situ FTIR, thermogravimetric analyses, Raman spectroscopy and TEM. Finally, the adhesion of SiC/ Tr /SiC bilayers, obtained using various <b>transient</b> <b>stages,</b> was investigated by scratch testing. For <b>transient</b> <b>stages</b> resulting from a decrease of Q MTS or T, crystallized or amorphous silicon can be co-deposited, due the higher reactivity of SiCl x radicals as compared to hydrocarbons. In this case, the continuous covalent bonding through the Si-rich interfacial layers preserves the strong adhesion between the two stoichiometric layers. <b>Transient</b> <b>stages</b> resulting from a decrease of Q H 2 close to zero eventually lead to the co-deposition of anisotropic carbon, due to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the gas phase. The interfacial layers with the largest thicknesses and including a continuous anisotropic carbon interlayer lead to poor adhesion properties.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>transient</b> <b>stage</b> is {{critical}} {{due to the}} stress induced by the chemical and thermal strain. In order to predict this strain, the oxygen activity field through the membrane needs to be known. Usually, the membrane {{is divided into three}} zones: the bulk where diffusion takes place and the two surfaces where exchanges between atmosphere and membrane take place. Oxygen bulk diffusion is well described by the Wagner theory. A consensus has not yet emerged regarding the surface exchange models proposed in the literature. Moreover, these models describe the permanent state, and cannot be extended to the <b>transient</b> <b>stage.</b> A new macroscopic surface exchange model which allows computing <b>transient</b> <b>stage</b> is proposed. This model assumed that the oxygen flux is governed by the association/dissociation of adsorbed oxygen and by the high energetic cost of oxygen reduction/oxidation. Then, the balance of transient specie only present on the surface is introduced to account for these two phenomena. The oxygen activity fields predicted by the proposed model are in agreement with the measures of chemical potential drop between the membrane and the atmosphere in permanent state. <b>Transient</b> <b>stage</b> measured during isothermal expansion test is partially reproduced...|$|E

Pressure ratios ranging from 4. 5 to 8. 5 with Reynolds numbers of the order 75 ? 000 – 140 ? 000 are considered. The studied configuration agrees well with the classical picture of the structure of highly underexpanded jets. Similarities and differences between simulation and experiments are discussed by comparing the concentration field structures from LES and planar laser induced fluorescence data. The <b>transient</b> <b>stages,</b> leading eventually to the highly underexpanded state, are visualized and investigated in terms of a phase diagram revealing the shock speeds and duration of the <b>transient</b> <b>stages.</b> For the studied nozzle pressure ratio range, the Mach disk dimensions are found to be in good agreement with literature data and experimental observations. It is observed how the nozzle pressure ratio influences the Mach disk width, and thereby the slip line separation, which leads to co-annular jets with inner and outer shear layers at higher pressure ratios. The improved mixing with increasing pressure ratio is demonstrated by the probability density functions of the concentration. The coherent structures downstream of the Mach disk are identified using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The structures indicate a helical mode originating from the shear layers of the jet. Despite the relatively low energy content of the dominant POD modes, the frequencies of the POD time coefficients explain the dominant frequencies in the pressure fluctuation spectra.

This model applies for the symmetric solidification of dilute binary solutions and does not invoke fluctuation-dissipation theorem to account for the fluctuation statistics. We devote our attention to the transient regime during which concentration gradients are building up and fluctuations act to destabilize the interface. To this end, we calculate both the temporally dependent growth rate of each mode and the power spectrum of the interface evolving under the effect of fluctuations. Quantitative agreement is found when comparing the phase-field simulations with theoretical predictions. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in Fluctuations and Noise Letter...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} cycle of great {{earthquakes}} along the San Andreas fault with a finite element numerical model of deformation in a crust with a nonlinear viscoelastic rheology. The viscous component of deformation has an effective viscosity that depends exponentially on the inverse absolute temperature and nonlinearity on the shear stress; the elastic deformation is linear. Crustal thickness and temperature are constrained by seismic and heat flow data for California. The models are for anti plane strain in a 25 -km-thick crustal layer having a very long, vertical strike-slip fault; the crustal block extends 250 km {{to either side of}} the fault. During the earthquake cycle that lasts 160 years, a constant plate velocity v(sub p) / 2 = 17. 5 mm yr is applied {{to the base of the}} crust and to the vertical end of the crustal block 250 km away from the fault. The upper half of the fault is locked during the interseismic period, while its lower half slips at the constant plate velocity. The locked part of the fault is moved abruptly 2. 8 m every 160 years to simulate great earthquakes. The results are sensitive to crustal rheology. Models with quartzite-like rheology display profound <b>transient</b> <b>stages</b> in the velocity, displacement, and stress fields. The predicted transient zone extends about 3 - 4 times the crustal thickness on each side of the fault, significantly wider than the zone of deformation in elastic models.
