5000|$|Cooling was {{provided}} by a pumped water system. Maybach's <b>tubular</b> <b>radiator,</b> patented in 1897, known as a honeycomb radiator, was similar to [...] ones. Its rectangular grille had [...] pipes with a square cross section of 6 mm × 6 mm to improve airflow, and held 9 L of water. The airflow was assisted by a fan located behind the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|They {{introduced}} a locomotive style, double-under mounted steam traction engine to the market. However, {{by this time}} track-type tractors and a combination combine-harvester were becoming more popular over the large steel tire wheel tractor and the stationary threshing machine. Continuing to grow, the company in 1916 purchased a former plant of the Kingman Plow Co., and in 1917 they acquired the Davis Manufacturing Co. engine plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, enabling Avery to build its own engines. J. B. Bartholomew had for several years been President of the Bartholomew Company, which manufactured Glide automobiles in Peoria Heights. In 1920 he decided to bring the plant into the Avery Co. fold and it was utilized to manufacture trucks. Avery employed four thousand people by this point. When the agricultural depression of the early 1920s struck, Avery's varied product offerings were expensive, and when farmers defaulted on their notes held by Avery dealers, the company's liberal credit policy badly hurt its finances. Farmers also showed increasing preference for track-type farm implements, and Avery failed to innovate with new products. They built one track-type tractor named the [...] "Trackrunner," [...] but were unsuccessful at perfecting it. Some machinery sold did not work as advertised, and Avery failed to fix the problems. Avery cut its work force in August 1920 by 90 per cent, to 250 workers. They replaced the <b>tubular</b> <b>radiator</b> style with an improved tubular cellular design, {{but it was not}} enough.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} number of domestic and industrial boilers are in operation in Ukraine. Nitrogen oxides are the most dangerous among all combustion products that pollute the atmosphere, therefore, one should take some measures for decreasing the formation of nitrogen oxides during combustion. The {{studies were carried out}} at the boilers of low power (100 kW) with a <b>tubular</b> <b>radiator</b> and an open end. The studies in the furnaces of industrial steam boilers having a <b>tubular</b> <b>radiator</b> with a closed end have not been done. The numerical study results of the gaseous fuel combustion processes in the furnace of a DE- 10 / 14 steam water-tube boiler are presented. The fuel-air mixture is formed by premixing the 15 % part of the air with a primary burner twist factor n= 2. 4 and a secondary burner twist factor n= 1. 6, and an air excess factor αв= 10. As a result of the studies, the temperature and velocity distributions of gases in the combustion chamber, the density of heat flows on the screen tubular surfaces, and the concentrations of the combustion components were determined. Flue gas recirculation in the volume of 80 - 100 % is provided, and the reversible movement of combustion products towards the combustion front provides a reduction in the concentration of nitrogen oxides up to 123 - 125 mg/m 3 at the furnace outlet. Disadvantages are the following: the formation of stagnant zones {{near the end of the}} secondary radiator. The optimum diameter of the <b>tubular</b> <b>radiator</b> equals to two burners diameters and <b>tubular</b> <b>radiator</b> is located at a distance of one meter from the burner cutoff...|$|E

5000|$|Schuster's {{start in}} the {{automotive}} industry had been building <b>tubular</b> <b>radiators</b> in October 1902 for the E.R. Thomas Motor Company at the Buffalo, New York factory. From there he quickly progressed to become the troubleshooter for Thomas, in charge of final vehicle assembly and often delivering Thomas cars to their new owners. In the early 1900s, first time auto owners or their chauffeurs were taught not only {{how to care for}} their new machine but often how to drive them by factory or dealer representatives.|$|R

The house will use the central system of hot water preparation. I selected a separated preparation of hot water {{for the production of}} untility hot water and hot water for heating. There will be two boilers installed in the house - a condensing and a low-temperature one. The condensing boiler will serve to prepare hot water for heating and the low temperature boiler for the preparation of hot utility water.

5000|$|The {{flying boat}} was {{powered by a}} pair of engines in {{push-pull}} configuration, mounted above the fuselage and just below the upper wing on two inward-leaning pairs of tubular N-struts, with further transverse cross-bracing. Their mounting also supported the wing centre-section with parallel pairs of struts outwards to the spars. Two types of engine could be used, either [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Mbr V12 enclosed in a common streamlined cowling and cooled with <b>tubular</b> <b>radiators</b> on the wing undersides {{on either side of the}} engines or [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Akx Jupiter nine-cylinder radials, mounted uncowled for cooling, with a circular section cowling between them. Both were geared-down. The forward propeller was well ahead of the wing leading edge but the rear turned in a shallow cut-out in the upper trailing edge. These engines were much more powerful than the [...] Gnome et Rhône 9Aas of the CAMS 51 and to accommodate them and their propellers on new mountings required the inter-plane gap to be increased.|$|R

The streamlined nose contours enclosed an oil tank with its outside wall exposed to the airstream. The wing was all metal with flat <b>tubular</b> water <b>radiators</b> smoothly faired into the wings. The twin pontoons had three smoothly-faired radiators on the outer surfaces, the forward radiator for water and the centre and rear radiators for oil cooling. The float struts also featured water radiators and another radiator was fitted during hot conditions under the fuselage running from cockpit to tail.|$|R

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. <b>Tubular</b> <b>radiators</b> for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|R
