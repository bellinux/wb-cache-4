50|$|This {{movement}} is the apotheosis of Hindemith's mastery of classical forms. It functions {{both as an}} unusual set of variations, as its name suggests, and as a full-fledged Sonata-Allegro movement. As indicated by the continuation of variations numbers from the previous movement, the theme being varied is the one from that movement, which functions as the second theme in Sonata-Allegro terminology. The first theme, introduced immediately {{at the beginning of}} the movement, is the very distinctive figure of a turn followed by an ascending scale. This figure is played and elaborated on by the soloist, with the pianist providing tonicizing changes of harmony at each instance of the turn figure. The viola then transforms this figure into the beginning of a more lyrical theme, which brings the music down in <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> level. The main theme returns momentarily, only to falter and give way to a new quiet theme which is a continuance of the rhythmic developments made by the first softer section. This theme, quick downward steps followed by a gentle Mannheim rocket and another set of descending steps, may easily be mistaken for a second theme, when in fact it is an extension and transformation of the movement's opening gesture.|$|E

We then propose the Local Maximum Phrase Detection method, which quantifies a performer's interpretation of phrase structure by associating each interpreted phrase with a local maximum in the dynamic curve.

40|$|This thesis {{engages with}} complex issues of musical {{expression}} and movement, and their relation, {{on the one}} hand, to musical structure and, on the other hand, to embodied musical experience. It aims {{to fill a gap}} in music theory and analysis: most methods overemphasise abstract conceptualisation of structural relations {{at the expense of the}} more dynamic, intuitive aspect of musical experience. As a solution, it offers a specific analytical method that can be used to explore dynamic aspects of music as experienced through the whole body. Drawing mainly on nineteenth-century piano music, I analyse aspects of structure in both composition and performance in terms of expressive and motional qualities, revealing the relationship between musical and physical movement. Expressivity in music derives its meaning, at least partly, from the embodied experience of music: performers shape expression through their whole body while listeners react to it in a comparable way, albeit less overtly. Two related systems of graphic notation are introduced, which provide a non-verbal means of representing expressive movement and at the same time encourage an immediate, visceral relationship to the music. The first notation captures the animated quality of expressive movement by analogy with the motion of a bouncing ball, while the second breaks down the expressive musical flow into discrete gestural patterns of specific motional character. While the ultimate value of this method lies in the analytical process it instigates, it also provides a novel theoretical framework that sheds light on the interaction, as well as integration, between structures such as metre, rhythm, harmony and voice-leading, which are traditionally studied mostly independently. In addition, it provides a useful tool for the study and communication of performance interpretation, based on data extracted from recordings in the form of <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> fluctuation graphs.

The development and validation of the PROMS are presented in studies 1 to 4. Overall, the PROMS has satisfactory psychometric properties for the composite score and fair to good coefficients for the individual subtests. Convergent validity was established with the relevant dimensions of Gordon’s Advanced Measures of Music Audiation and Musical Aptitude Profile (melody, rhythm, tempo), the Musical Ear Test (rhythm), and sample instrumental sounds (timbre). Criterion validity is evidenced by a sizeable relationship between test performance and a composite of various indicators of musical proficiency as well as discriminant validity by a generic auditory discrimination task. The application of the PROMS in examining the structure of music perception mechanism is also presented. In particular, the relationship between music perception skills and non-musical abilities is explored in Study 4. The results suggest that the interrelationships among the various subtests could be accounted for by two higher order factors, sensory and structural music processing; the structural processing skill is related to short-term and working memory. Rhythm perception (rhythm and rhythm-to-melody subtests) also shows significant correlation with general mental ability. An Internet study with the PROMS was conducted to examine whether the findings of controlled studies can be replicated with a more diverse population and uncontrolled environment. Most of the findings of the controlled studies were replicated in the Internet study with several exceptions that are reported in Study 5.

40|$|The task of {{conducting}} human musicians {{in a live}} performance by a computer {{has not yet been}} addressed extensively before. A few attempts exist at letting a computer perform this task, but there is no interactive virtual conductor who can conduct human musicians and can interact with these musicians. The virtual conductor described in this report can conduct human musicians in a live performance interactively. The conductor can conduct 1 -, 2 -, 3 - or 4 -beat patterns. Tempo changes can be indicated {{in such a way that}} musicians can follow the change. Dynamics are supported by changing the amplitude of the conducting gestures, so that music that should be loud will make the conductor conduct bigger and music that should be played softly will be conducted smaller. These signals to musicians all are given before the actual change occurs, so that musicians are prepared that the tempo or dynamics will change. Accents are indicated by conducting the preparation of a beat bigger. The conductor listens to the musicians as they play to follow their performance. He can track the beat of the musicians with a beat-tracker and can read along with the score as musicians play. For future reactions of the conductor, a chord detector has been designed and implemented, to allow the future conductor to detect wrong notes. This information is used to interact with the musicians: if the musicians start playing slower or faster when they should not be, the conductor will notice this and try to correct this. First, the conductor will follow the musicians so they do not lose track, then the conductor will lead the musicians back to the original tempo. The conductor has been evaluated several times with groups of human musicians. The musicians could follow the <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> changes of the conductor reasonably well. The conductor could interact succesfully with the musicians, correcting their tempo if they played too fast or to slow. The musicians enjoyed playing with the virtual conductor and could see uses for it, especially if the conductor is further extended. Concluded can be that a virtual conductor has been designed and implemented that can interact with musicians in a live music performance. This conductor is only a basic version of a conductor and can be extended in almost all aspects. So, while a basic version exists, this is still a lot left for future research on this subject. Potential applications of the future and current virtual conductor are for example a rehearsal conductor for when a human conductor is not available or as a conductor for when studying orchestral parts at home together with a recording or MIDI-version of the rest of the orchestra, including a conductor...|$|E
40|$|What is interpretation? One {{can imagine}} a range of answers to this question. One answer might begin with the {{observation}} that the English word “interpretation” is {{used to refer to}} a variety of human activities. Translators at the United Nations interpret remarks made in French when they offer an English translation. Literary critics interpret novels when they investigate the deep and sometimes unconscious motivations of the author. Conductors interpret a score when they make decisions about meter, <b>tempo,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> range. Actors interpret a screenplay when they improvise new lines based on their understanding of the characters. Judges interpret statutes when they attempt to disambiguate words and phrases that could have multiple senses. The term “interpretation” is used in a variety of contexts to refer to a variety of human activities. It might be the case that the word “interpretation” is used in different senses in these diverse contexts-–the word “interpretation” may be ambiguous. Or it could be the case that the diversity of interpretive activities is evidence that “interpretation” is a “family resemblance” concept (to use Wittgenstein’s felicitous phrase) : the various forms of interpretation may share an overlapping set of characteristics, but lack an “essence” or core. And finally, it is possible that all of the diverse human activities that we call “interpretation” are unified-–that “interpretation” is a functional kind with an essential structure. In other words, {{there are at least three}} views about the relationship between all of the various activities that we call “interpretation”; we can express these three views as three competing theses or claims. The ambiguity thesis is the claim that the word “interpretation” refers to several conceptually distinct activities and that it is simply a mistake to advance a theory of interpretation that seeks to unify them. The family resemblance thesis is the claim that the diversity of interpretive phenomena is structured by a series of common features, no one of which is shared by all of the activities that we call “interpretation. ” The unity-of-interpretation thesis is the claim that all (or almost all) of the activities that we call “interpretation” share a common structure or set of essential properties. This essay investigates the unity-of-interpretation thesis in relation to the views advanced by Ronald Dworkin, in his new, deeply interesting, and sure-to-be-controversial book, ﻿﻿Justice for Hedgehogs. Justice for Hedgehogs represents the latest stage in the development of Dworkin’s complex and evolving theory of interpretation. Part I of this essay argues that as Dworkin’s theory of “interpretation” has developed, the object of the theory has shifted from the interpretation of legal texts to the construction of legal rules to general normative theory. Part II explicates the theory of interpretation offered in Justice for Hedgehogs and the unity-of-interpretation thesis-–the claim that all of the various activities that we call “interpretation” share an essential structure with all human intellectual activities other than science. This part concludes that Dworkin’s view obscures rather than illuminates the nature of “interpretation” in law and legal theory. Part III suggests a reconstruction of Dworkin’s view that draws on the distinction between “interpretation” and “construction. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel method for automatic segmentation of folk music field recordings.

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} critically on {{the creation}} of Albumleaves (2013) for trumpet and string quartet from its conceptual and aesthetic origins through the process of composition to rehearsal. Its aims are to examine certain experimental techniques in Albumleaves and illuminate the piece as a dialogue (Benson, 2003) between composer and performer, one facilitated by the score and evidenced through rehearsal documentation. Albumleaves marks a pronounced turn towards a more experimental approach to composition drawing freely on innovations pioneered by Cage and his circle from the 1950 s and embracing the concept of the open work (Eco, 1989). This has resulted {{in a wide variety of}} indeterminate notational strategies and a marked turn towards abstraction, avoiding temporal structures articulated via aural ‘signposts’ (Nyman, 1999) and, instead, attempting a freer play of sonic materials. The catalyst for this shift was a desire to move away from the well known hierarchical model of musical creativity, one that tends to split composer and performer roles along creative and re-creative lines (Goehr 1992, Wishart 2002), towards a more collaborative composer-performer relationship. By using a less determinate notation the intention was to widen, and investigate, the gap between score and performance, concurrently broadening the notion of interpretation and, consequently, the area over which performers can exercise creativity. This includes form, textural density, and figurative detail, in addition to traditional areas such as <b>tempo,</b> articulation <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> shading. Having identified and illustrated points of contact with the experimental tradition the paper will then examine their limits. The analysis of audio-visual rehearsal documentation will interrogate the efficacy of terms such as ‘collaboration’, ‘dialogue’, ‘creativity’, ‘freedom’ and so on to describe how the score functions with respect to interpretation and the experimentalism of Albumleaves will be contextualised with respect to recent manifestations of the tradition, for example the music of the Wandelweise collective...|$|R
40|$|The {{genre of}} trumpet and string quartet {{is in its}} early stages. While the {{combination}} is opportunistic, given the extensive availability of trumpet and string quartets, it nonetheless presents a difficult acoustic environment. This practice-led paper presents a particular compositional response to these challenges, which {{has given rise to}} a variety of indeterminate notations and, in turn, considerable formal flexibility. As well as being guided by the acoustic peculiarities of trumpet with string quartet, the notational strategy adopted is part of an ongoing attempt by the composer to explore a more collaborative composer-performer relationship. By using a less determinate notation the intention is to widen, and investigate, the gap between score and performance, concurrently broadening the notion of interpretation and, consequently, the area over which performers can exercise creativity. This includes form, textural density, and figurative detail, in addition to traditional areas such as <b>tempo,</b> articulation <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> shading. The reified ‘work’ has now given way to the more contingent ‘piece’, a co-created space inhabited and transformed by the performers. [Benson 2003] The notations used in Albumleaves draw freely on innovations pioneered by Cage and his circle from the 1950 s. While the performers involved in this paper play a considerable amount of new music, the lack of notational specificity and the formal openness of this particular work represent new challenges. Albumleaves is therefore a means of conducting research into how performers respond to the increased indeterminacy, hence increased responsibility, engendered by such an approach. The research has been documented via the Com-phone application developed by the University of Surrey’s Digital World Research Centre, which allows ‘on-the-fly’ creation of image-based narratives. The results of this research inform the development of the composer’s notation, suggesting ways in which it can appeal to non-specialist performers amenable to more collaborative working methods...|$|R
