500|$|The {{mirror is}} a {{perfectly}} defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws {{the attention of the}} viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent sheen of the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller points out that apart from [...] "adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".|$|E
60|$|Maxwell {{pointed to}} the jungle fading into <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the east.|$|E
60|$|I {{was staring}} at her face. It seemed white and set in <b>the</b> <b>dimness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Midwinter rose, without answering. <b>The</b> evening <b>dimness</b> among <b>the</b> trees, which {{obscured}} his face, {{made his}} silence doubly perplexing.|$|R
60|$|Alice laughed, a clear {{laugh that}} mingled musically with {{the call of}} a wood pigeon in <b>the</b> green <b>dimness</b> above.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{answers the}} hy√¶na?" [...] growled Andoo, peering through <b>the</b> midnight <b>dimness</b> at them, {{and then going}} to look at the cliff edge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where the stepping-stones stretch across. A path comes {{twisting}} {{down through}} <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the wood, {{and there are}} black firs upon the ridge above." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{lights of}} the {{thrumming}} car grew magically; were upon them; abruptly stopped. From behind <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the windshield a voice, annoyed, sharp: [...] "Hello there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|See {{also the}} {{comparison}} of <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the faces seen around him [...] in Paradise to [...] "a pearl on a white forehead." [...] (Paradiso, III. 14.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will it be long--will it be short?" [...] thought I, passing my {{hand across}} {{my eyes to}} {{dissipate}} <b>the</b> silvery <b>dimness</b> of a suave, south-wind shower.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} {{footsteps}} on the pavement died out in <b>the</b> discreet <b>dimness</b> of <b>the</b> shop. Only the gas-jet above the table went on purring equably in the brooding silence of the parlour.|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{dropped his}} head upon his hands, {{somewhat}} ashamed of <b>the</b> smarting <b>dimness</b> in his eyes. He had {{not meant to}} say so much. Yet what a relief to let out that long-congested burden! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>dimness</b> of Will's {{eyesight}} {{had been}} increasing all this while; {{but he was}} somehow conscious of a sharp and chilling scrutiny which irritated and yet overmastered him.|$|E
60|$|The dungeon of the Inquisition. The {{morning of}} the Auto-da-Fe dawns dimly through a barred window. A few faint stars are shining. Swallows are {{circling}} in <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> without.|$|E
60|$|The cracked voice {{replied that}} it was Affery: and an old woman came forward into what {{doubtful}} light there was, and kissed her hand once; then subsided again into <b>the</b> <b>dimness.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is the child?" [...] he asked, {{surprised}} at the penetrating chilliness {{of the air and}} <b>the</b> unwonted <b>dimness</b> of <b>the</b> lamp by which he used to sit up half the night with the open Bible before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that you, James Redfield?" [...] David Gillespie asked, {{peering at}} him in <b>the</b> night's <b>dimness.</b> [...] "This is the man that helped me {{to get you a}} lock of that scoundrel's hair," [...] he said to his daughter.|$|R
60|$|Thus, in her decisive way, did Mrs. Porter {{spread light}} and {{sweetness}} with both hands, achieving the bodily salvation of George while, {{at the same}} time, furthering the loves of Ruth and Kirk by leaving them alone together to make each other's better acquaintance in <b>the</b> romantic <b>dimness</b> of <b>the</b> studio.|$|R
60|$|Mile after mile. Mostly {{she talked}} of the boulevards and Pere Dureon, of Debussy and artichokes, in little {{laughing}} sentences that sprang like fire out of <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the mist.|$|E
60|$|The girl's {{face was}} a full, perfect oval, with {{features}} of faultless regularity, and the large, full eyes were of tawny hazel, darkened into inscrutable gloom in <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the corner.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{was glad}} that <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> which was {{creeping}} across the valley had deepened the shadow in the room, for he was not anxious that the girl should see his face just then.|$|E
6000|$|Our little voices went on interminably, and at {{one stage}} my cousin {{got out of bed}} and made his brother do likewise, and knelt in <b>the</b> night <b>dimness</b> and prayed at me. That I found trying, but I held out valiantly. [...] "Forgive him," [...] said my cousin, [...] "he knows not what he sayeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{wood was}} so spacious above them, that He who had stars for His flocks [...] Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from [...] His dew-cumbered skies; [...] So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their nests [...] in their locks, [...] Filling <b>the</b> fibrous <b>dimness</b> with long generations of eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Further {{down the}} valley the {{clustered}} tombstones [...] recede, Winding about their <b>dimness</b> <b>the</b> mist's grey [...] cerements, after The street lamps in the darkness have suddenly [...] started to bleed.|$|R
60|$|The thought {{reminded}} him of Baldwin's teaching. He bent forward his head and wiped the glass with his night-cap, but without much advantage, for <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> {{was caused by the}} muddiness of the water.|$|E
60|$|Razumov {{felt his}} voice growing thick in his throat. <b>The</b> <b>dimness</b> of Councillor Mikulin's {{eyes seemed to}} spread all over his face and made it indistinct to Razumov's sight. He tried to {{disregard}} these phenomena.|$|E
60|$|She gave no heed to this; {{she turned}} away. But {{in a moment}} she came back, and stood looking at me, and her {{beautiful}} solemn eyes seemed to shine in <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the room.|$|E
60|$|Grierson {{nodded as}} he glanced about. The stretch of desolate white prairie had {{contracted}} {{since he had}} last noticed it, <b>the</b> surrounding <b>dimness</b> was creeping nearer in, and the ranks of poplar trunks were losing their sharpness of form. Now that the men had ceased chopping, {{they could hear the}} eerie moaning of the wind and the sharp patter of icy snow-dust among the withered brush.|$|R
60|$|The nights {{had been}} getting lighter rapidly, but <b>the</b> soft <b>dimness</b> was puzzling {{when the two}} men faced the ascent. They could not judge the {{steepness}} of the slope; they plunged into bushes they had not noticed, and there were spots where they narrowly escaped dangerous falls. Slipping, scrambling, floundering, Andrew struggled up with his load, and sank down, worn out and aching, beside Graham's fire.|$|R
6000|$|The {{successor}} of the sheet-iron {{hamlet of}} the mangrove marshes has that other Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens. We cannot have these paradises. The {{best we could}} {{do would be to}} cover a vast acreage under glass and apply steam heat. But it would be inadequate, the lacks would still be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation, <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>dimness,</b> <b>the</b> sweaty heat--these would all be there, in place of the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the breeze. Whatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly out of doors in Australia.--[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is an authoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862. The thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade. In January, 1880, the heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.] ...|$|R
60|$|He, too, {{vanished}} into <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> with a dying beat of hoofs, and {{so out of}} our life; and we two were left alone, hand in hand, with only the future before us, on the moonlit prairie.|$|E
6000|$|Dlorus sprang up, flung {{into the}} cabin, stood in <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> of the doorway, holding a butcher knife and clamoring, [...] "I will! I'll kill myself {{if you leave}} me! Take me down to Mr. Kloh, at North Yakima, tonight!" ...|$|E
6000|$|O phantoms! {{you cover}} all the land, and all the sea! O I cannot see in <b>the</b> <b>dimness</b> whether you smile or frown upon me; O vapour, a look, a word! O well-beloved! O you dear women's and men's phantoms! ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{brilliant}} was the snow-glare {{that when}} she entered the house she saw the door-knobs, the newspaper on the table, every white surface as dazzling mauve, and her head was dizzy in <b>the</b> pyrotechnic <b>dimness.</b> When her eyes had recovered she felt expanded, drunk with health, mistress of life. The world was so luminous that she sat down at her rickety little desk in the living-room to make a poem. (She got no farther than [...] "The sky is bright, the sun is warm, there ne'er will be another storm.") ...|$|R
60|$|Wedges of gold, great anchors, {{heaps of}} pearl, inestimable stones, unvalued jewels--all {{scattered}} {{in the bottom}} of the sea! Dead men's bones were there also, and long white creatures who had never seen the light, for they mostly dwelt in the clefts of rocks where the sun's rays could not come. At first our little fish felt as if she were blind also, but by-and-by she began to make out one object after another in <b>the</b> green <b>dimness,</b> and by <b>the</b> time she had swum for a few hours all became clear.|$|R
6000|$|I awoke: {{the strange}} horse without summons {{out of the}} {{distance}} ran, [...] Thrusting his nose to my shoulder; he knew in his bosom deep [...] That once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man, [...] And that I would leave <b>the</b> immortals, their <b>dimness,</b> [...] their dews dropping sleep.|$|R
