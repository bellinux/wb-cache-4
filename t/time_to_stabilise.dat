30|$|Although high {{temperatures}} were attained {{in the no}} straw and the 10 % straw composts during composting, nitrogen losses were, however, high signifying the loss of an important resource. The mixtures with 30 % and 50 % straw behaved in similar ways with respect to N and C mineralization, but the N losses were less with the composts to which 30 % straw were added suggesting {{that this was the}} optimal mixture. The pH and EC values of most of the final composts suggest that the compost materials needed more composting <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise.</b> The results of this study indicated that peri-urban organic wastes with 50 % straw or less can be composted but with measures being taken to achieve temperatures greater than 55 °C for at least 3 days to destroy weed seeds and pathogens. This highlights the potential of composting peri-urban organic materials as a waste disposal method. The composts with 30 % straw mixture had the greatest potential as a soil amendment in peri-urban areas of Harare as they effectively reduced nitrogen losses. Further studies are however essential to evaluate the compost quality over a longer period and assess its effect on plant growth.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} framework {{allowing for}} analyses on standard products, such as dense hot-mix asphalt, must be completed to analyse the behaviour of porous cold-mix asphalts. Such soft materials need <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise</b> its performances and short-term loading can drive to large {{deterioration of the}} applied layer. The effects of wheel tread turning and rubbing on asphalt surface have to be understood. In order to do that, the tribological behaviour of an asphalt surface is studied using an apparatus that can load a sample surface simultaneously in compression and torsion. The paper describes the technical details and {{the design of the}} apparatus, followed by a description of the adopted experimental test protocol. Tests are realised with imposed normal load and rotation rate of a disc. The adhesion and friction stresses are calculated from torque measurement. The displacement of sample surface during torsion is recorded. The value of this parameter {{at the end of the}} test appears as a useful degradation indicator. Performing tests during ageing of sample enlighten us on the stabilisation of the performances. The interpretation of results is illustrated by tests carried out on porous cold-mix asphalt that is particularly sensitive...|$|E

Design Case control study. Setting Laboratory setting. Participants Participants were 30 ACLD patients and 30 control subjects. Main outcome measures <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise</b> (TTS) was measured using centre of pressure (COP), horizontal (Fy) and vertical (Fz) force velocity on a Kistler forceplate. Kinematic data were collected using a Vicon 512 system with 8 IR cameras. Between group differences were analysed using a two-way ANOVA with post hoc t-tests. Results Significant group {{differences were found in}} running speed, hop distance, failed attempts, deceleration, and TTS using COP velocity in both activities. Conclusions When required to stop and balance on their injured leg, ACLD participants selected slower running speeds and less hop distance to succeed from than did controls, and they used different strategies to stabilise upon landing. They also showed a significantly poorer ability to maintain stable stance following deceleration. ACLD individuals who were able to adapt with some success did so by increasing the time available to them and limiting function to within the boundaries they can control effectively...|$|E

40|$|In the {{recording}} of biomedical signals, a significant noise component is introduced by the electrode. The magnitude of this noise is considerably higher than the equivalent thermal noise from the electrode impedance. As the noise in surface electrodes limits the resolution of biopotential recordings, {{it is important to}} understand its origin. It was found that the noise mainly originates in the electrolyte-skin interface and that it is highly dependent on the electrode gel used and the skin properties of the test subject. Depending on skin treatment, magnitudes between 1 and 20 muV(rms) were measured among subjects. When the metal-electrolyte interface was allowed <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise,</b> electrodes of different metals measured face to face all showed a negligibly small noise magnitude (< 1 muV(rms)), In pre-gelled electrodes, where the metal-electrolyte interface has stabilised, no difference in noise properties was found between Ag-AgCl electrodes and other metals when measured on the skin. In subjects at rest, the contribution of EMG signals to the total noise level was shown to be negligibly small compared with the noise contribution of the electrolyte-skin interface. The magnitude of the noise of electrodes appeared to be inversely proportional to the square root of the area of the electrode on the ski...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of human crowd {{is an interesting}} phenomenon in which individuals are set as a collection that comprises of a highly dynamic social group. The crowd behaviors have been investigated by researchers over the years. Recent works include the study in modeling and controlling of the dynamic psychological {{behavior of}} crowds such as students’ behavior in a classroom or people’s behavior in a one-dimensional queue. In this paper, an improved version of the psychological crowd model has been proposed, where the social interaction between two individuals in a crowd is represented by a weightage, called the weight of social interaction. It {{has been shown that}} the inclusion of the social interaction weight has allowed social interactions between individuals to be included and results in a more accurate representation of the crowd’s psychological factors propagations. Since the psychological dynamics of crowd is naturally unstable, this paper also discusses the application of two nonlinear control approaches to stabilise the crowd to make it calm. Results show that for a crowd of n number of agents, the single-agent controller gives similar performance with the n-agent controller but with much less resources. The simulation results also show that it takes less amount of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise</b> a crowd when the crowd model includes social interaction weights...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{models of}} stochastic, clonally {{reproducing}} populations are {{defined in terms}} of general branching processes, allowing birth during maternal life, as for higher organisms, or by splitting, as in cell division. The populations are assumed to start small, by mutation or immigration, reproduce supercritically while smaller than the habitat carrying capacity but subcritically above it. Such populations establish themselves with a probability wellknown from branching process theory. Once established, they grow up to a band around the carrying capacity in a time that is logarithmic in the latter, assumed large. There they prevail during a time period whose duration is exponential in the carrying capacity. Even populations whose life style is sustainble {{in the sense that the}} habitat carrying capacity is not eroded but remains the same, ultimately enter an extinction phase, which again lasts for a time logarithmic in the carrying capacity. However, if the habitat can carry a population which is large, say millions of individuals, and it manages to avoid early extinction, time in generations to extinction will be exorbitantly long, and during it, population composition over ages, types, lineage etc. will have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise.</b> This paper aims at an exhaustive description of the life cycle of such populations, from inception to extinction, extending and overviewing earlier results. We shall also say some words on persistence times of populations with smaller carrying capacities and short life cycles, where the population may indeed be in danger in spite of not eroding its environment...|$|E

40|$|Background Most {{randomised}} {{clinical trials}} (RCTs) testing a new health service {{do not allow}} a run-in period of consolidation before evaluating the new approach. Consequently, health professionals involved may feel insufficiently familiar or confident, or that new processes or systems that are integral to the service are insufficiently embedded in routine care prior to definitive evaluation in a RCT. This study aimed to determine the optimal run-in period for a new physiotherapy-led telephone assessment and treatment service known as PhysioDirect and whether a run-in was needed prior to evaluating outcomes in an RCT. Methods The PhysioDirect trial assessed whether PhysioDirect was as effective as usual care. Prior to the main trial, a run-in of up to 12 weeks was permitted to facilitate physiotherapists to become confident in delivering the new service. Outcomes collected from the run-in and main trial were length of telephone calls within the PhysioDirect service and patients’ physical function (SF- 36 v 2 questionnaire) and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile v 2 collected at baseline and six months.

40|$|Australia and the {{international}} community are living through a time of consequences. If the mainstream science is broadly right, we have little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise</b> and then to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases, {{if there is to be}} a reasonable chance of avoiding dangerous anthropogenic climate change. Most of you know that better than I do. This year, a meeting under United Nations auspices is to set the rules for emissions reductions and trade for the period after the Kyoto arrangements come to their conclusion in 2012. This is the first year of a new Obama administration in the United States, coming to office with a commitment to participation in strong global action to combat anthropogenic climate change. It is the year in which Australia makes critical decisions on mitigation policy. It is also the year after the Great Crash of 2008. A collapse of global financial intermediation of unprecedented dimension is sending powerful recessionary pulses through the world economy. I said in the concluding chapter of the Garnaut Climate Change Review that when human society receives a large shock to its established patterns of life, the outcome is unpredictable but generally problematic (Garnaut 2008, p 591). Things fall apart. I said that unmitigated climate change, or mitigation too weak to avoid dangerous climate change, could give human society such a shock. We know that the possibilities from climate change include shocks far more severe than those in the past which have exceeded society’s capacity to cope, and moved societies to the point of fracture. For these reasons, the decisions that are to be made at Copenhagen in December this year would be fateful—whether decisions to move forward with a comprehensive global agreement to mitigate climate change, or to postpone action, or to do nothing, or to take one more step on a journey of a thousand li...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo assess pain or {{stress in}} newborn infants {{submitted}} to intensive care is important but difficult, as different observational pain scales {{are not always}} reliable in premature infants. As an indicator of pain, skin conductance (SC) measurements have detected increased sweating in newborn infants > 28 gestational age (GA) submitted to heel lancing. ObjectiveTo measure SC during heel lancing and routine care in newborn infants, born at 22 to 27 GA, with special relation to postnatal age (PNA). MethodsIn six infants < 28 + 0 GA and 4 infants ≥ 28 + 0 GA spontaneous SC activity and behavioural state (Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS)) was measured before, during and after each intervention. Measurements were repeated in each patient at different PNA. ResultsBaseline SC prior to intervention took longer <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise</b> and was higher in < 28 than in ≥ 28 + 0 PNA. The combination of heel lancing and squeezing gave an increased SC in < 28 PNA, whereas heel lancing alone gave the same SC response in ≥ 28 + 0 PNA. A possibly continued immature response in SC measurements was not observed. Oral glucose admission prior to heel lancing increased SC. Routine care did not give any changes in SC. Except during orogastric tube placement no signs of discomfort or pain could be detected by the neonatal pain, agitation and sedation scale (N-PASS) in < 28 PNA. ConclusionChanges in SC could be detected in infants at < 28 + 0 PNA and related to the combination of heel lancing and squeezing. A maturational development of the SC was observed in infants born < 28 GA. SC seems {{to be able to}} differentiate between pain and discomfort...|$|E
40|$|Robust {{statistics}} {{and the use}} of robust estimators have come more and more into focus during the last couple of years. In the context of flood statistics, robust estimation methods are used to obtain stable estimations of e. g. design floods. These are estimations that do not change from one year to another just because one large flood occurred. A problem which is often ignored in flood statistics is the underlying dependence structure of the data. When considering discharge data with high time-resolution, short range dependent behaviour can be detected within the time series. To take this into account, in this thesis a limit theorem for the class of GL-statistics is developed under the very general assumption of near epoch dependent processes on absolutely regular random variables, which is a well known concept of short range dependence. GL-statistics form a very general class of {{statistics and}} can be used to represent many robust and non-robust estimators, such as Gini's mean difference, the Qn-estimator or the generalized Hodges-Lehmann estimator. In a direct application the limit distribution of L-moments and their robust extension, the trimmed L-moments, is derived. Moreover, a long-run variance estimator is developed. For all these results, the use of U-statistics and U-processes proves to be the key tool, such that a Central Limit Theorem for multivariate U-statistics as well as an invariance principle for U-processes and the convergence of the remaining term of the Bahadur-representation for U-quantiles is shown. A challenge for proving these results pose the multivariate kernels that are considered to be able to represent very general estimators and statistics. A concrete application in the context of flood statistics, in particular in the estimation of design floods, the classification of homogeneous groups and the modelling of short range dependent discharge series, is given. Here, well known models (peak-over-thresholds) as well as newly developed ones, for example mixing models using the distinction of floods according to their timescales, are combined with robust estimators and the advantages and disadvantages under consideration of stability and efficiency are investigated. The results show that the use of the new models, that take more information into account by enlarging the data basis, in combination with robust estimators leads to a very stable estimation of design floods, even in high quantiles. Whereas a lot of the classical estimators, like Maximum-Likelihood estimators or L-moments, are affected by single extraordinary extreme events and need a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stabilise,</b> the robust methods approach the same level of stabilisation rather fast. Moreover, the newly developed mixing model cannot only be used for flood estimation but also for regionalisation, that is the modelling of ungauged basins. Here, especially when needing a classification of flood events and homogeneous groups of gauges, the use of robust estimators proves to result in stable estimations, too...|$|E
30|$|The {{scalability}} of {{a proposal}} is primarily {{affected by the}} execution complexity of the adaptation decision making process. Most proposals are centralised, and memory and CPU adaptation are scheduled across the entire infrastructure. While this gives opportunities for global optimisation, it presents a significant challenge when managing thousands of resources. In [38], the authors used a centralised reinforcement learning engine and the <b>time</b> taken <b>to</b> <b>stabilise</b> performance increased {{with the size of}} the managed cluster. The central controller in [41] took significant <b>time</b> <b>to</b> execute the scheduling of 15 nodes, which had 109 control options, just to adapt CPU resource - memory configuration was not covered. The centralised engine in [19] was only able to manage 400 nodes with 1000 VMs, when adapting CPU and VM configurations. In later work [53], the authors changed their centralised approach to a hierarchical architecture, resulting in the ability to support 7200 servers with up to 60, 000 VMs. In [35], the authors propose an alternative layered approach where each node has a decision engine, with no global controller. While this enabled each node to perform its own allocation, it lost out on the opportunity to redistribute workloads across the data centre infrastructure.|$|R

Granular sludge has been used for the treatment of several industrial wastewaters, but nothing has been reported about wastewater characterized by the simultaneous presence of hydrocarbons and high chloride concentration. In this work, the authors analysed the granulation process and performance as well as the physical characteristics of aerobic granules in two Granular Sequencing Batch Airlift Reactors (GSBARs), fed with acetate-based synthetic wastewater in reactor 1 (R 1) and with a mixture of real and simulated slop (R 2). The results obtained in 100 days show that full granulation was achieved in both reactors.
