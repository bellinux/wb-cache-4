25|$|In Unicode, {{a script}} is a {{collection}} of letters and other written signs used to represent <b>textual</b> <b>information</b> in one or more writing systems. Some scripts support one and only one writing system and language, for example, Armenian. Other scripts support many different writing systems; for example, the Latin script supports English, French, German, Italian, Vietnamese, Latin itself, and several other languages. Some languages make use of multiple alternate writing systems, thus also use several scripts. In Turkish, the Arabic script was used before the 20th century, but transitioned to Latin {{in the early part of}} the 20th century. For a list of languages supported by each script see the list of languages by writing system. More or less complementary to scripts are symbols and Unicode control characters.|$|E

Although the earliest extant Chinese maps date to the 4th century BC, and tujing since the Qin (221–206 BC) or Han dynasties, this was the first known instance in China when the <b>textual</b> <b>information</b> of tujing became the primary element over the drawn illustrations. This Sui dynasty process of providing maps and visual aids in written gazetteers—as well as the submitting of gazetteers with illustrative maps by local administrations to the central government—was continued in every subsequent Chinese dynasty.|$|E

2500|$|While {{working in}} the Department of Arms, the Tang dynasty {{cartographer}} Jia Dan (730–805) and his colleagues would acquire information from foreign envoys about their respective homelands, and from these interrogations would produce maps supplemented by <b>textual</b> <b>information.</b> Even within China, ethnographic information on ethnic minorities of non-Han peoples were often described in the local histories and gazetteers of provinces such as Guizhou during the Ming and Qing dynasties. As the Qing dynasty pushed further with its troops and government authorities into areas of Guizhou that were uninhabited and not administered by the Qing government, the official gazetteers of the region would be revised to include the newly drawn-up districts and non-Han ethnic groups (mostly Miao peoples) therein. While the late Ming dynasty officials who compiled {{the information on the}} ethnic groups of Guizhou offered scanty details about them in their gazetteers (perhaps due to their lack of contact with these peoples), the later Qing dynasty gazetteers often provided a much more comprehensive analysis. By 1673 the Guizhou gazetteers featured different written entries for the various Miao peoples of the region. Historian Laura Holsteter writes on the woodblock print illustrations of Miao peoples in the Guizhou gazeteer, stating [...] "the 1692 version of the Kangxi era gazetteer show a refinement in the quality of the illustrations by comparison to 1673".|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the potential of <b>textual</b> haptic <b>information</b> to minimize the effects of need for touch (NFT) in global online environments by testing the effect of hands on description on consumer perception and intention to purchase. Design/methodology/approach – The study was developed in three stages. A total of 140 valid responses were obtained in stage three. Multiple linear regression models and paired-samples t-test were applied to test the hypotheses. Findings – The results show that <b>textual</b> haptic <b>information</b> has a positive impact on consumers’ perception and on the intention to purchasing. Practical implications – To improve online sales firms should minimize the drawback of the inability of touching the product by providing <b>textual</b> haptic <b>information.</b> Originality/value – The findings are especially valuable since the number of studies assessing NFT in online apparel commerce is currently very limited. Thus, this study adds new empirical evidences to existent body of knowledge and could assist the development of global marketing strategies for increasing online fashion sales. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{communications}} are {{an integral}} aspect of health education and promotion. However, the commonly used <b>textual</b> risk <b>information</b> is relatively difficult to understand for the average recipient. Consequently, researchers and health promoters have started to focus on so-called decision aids, such as tables and graphs. Although tabular and graphical risk information more effectively communicate risks than <b>textual</b> risk <b>information,</b> the cognitive mechanisms responsible for this enhancement are unclear. This study aimed to examine two possible mechanisms (i. e., cognitive workload and attention). Cognitive workload (mean pupil size and peak pupil dilation) and attention directed to the risk information (viewing time, number of eye fixations, and eye fixation durations) were both measured in a between-subjects experimental design. The results suggest that graphical risk information facilitates comprehension of that information because it attracts and holds attention {{for a longer period}} of time than <b>textual</b> risk <b>information.</b> Graphs are thus a valuable asset to risk communication practice for two reasons: first, they tend to attract attention and, second, when attended to, they elicit information extraction with relatively little cognitive effort, and finally result in better comprehension...|$|R

40|$|Patent {{have often}} {{been seen as a}} useful {{information}} source for technology monitoring. Nevertheless, analyzing patent information remains a demanding task, and this is largely due to the ever increasing number and extent of patent documents. A very useful tool for dealing with the information overflow in order to analyze <b>textual</b> patent <b>information</b> {{can be found in the}} application of semantic patent analysis. Following up on this, approaches to the content-based analysis of <b>textual</b> patent <b>information</b> for technology monitoring are introduced in this thesis. Relating to the usefulness of patent information for technology monitoring, it is shown that technologies are published in patents on a large scale. Furthermore, patents provide information about new technologies at an early stage. From a methodological point of view, the role of design decisions for concept extraction is highlighted. Additionally, semantic patent analysis is adapted for technology monitoring and its specific tasks...|$|R

Finally, we present some techniques allowing {{to improve the quality of}} the similarities in the case where additional knowledge, such as external corpora or semantic graphs, is available...|$|R
