5|$|The Commonwealth {{shall not}} make any law for {{establishing}} any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so {{the exclusion of}} Negroes from white communities became {{a substitute for the}} Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E
50|$|The first prong investigates whether {{government}} has burdened <b>the</b> individual's <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion. If government confronts {{an individual with}} a choice that pressures the individual to forego a religious practice, whether by imposing a penalty or withholding a benefit, then the {{government has}} burdened <b>the</b> individual's <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment {{states that}} [...] "Congress shall make no law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, or prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> thereof".|$|R
2500|$|The Wisconsin Supreme Court [...] "sustained respondents' {{claim that}} {{application}} of the compulsory school-attendance law to them violated their rights under <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment." ...|$|R
5|$|The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution {{prevents}} Congress {{from making}} any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion, or abridging {{the freedom of}} speech, {{the freedom of the}} press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on {{the freedom of the}} press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The {{product of a}} compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E
50|$|Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333 (1890), was a United States Supreme Court case affirming, by a 9-0 vote, {{that federal}} laws against {{polygamy}} did not conflict with <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Rehnquist joined Lee v. Weismans {{dissenting opinion}} that <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment to the Constitution only forbids {{government}} from preferring one particular religion over another.Justice Souter wrote a dissent specifically addressed to Rehnquist {{on this issue}} in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Government {{policy and}} {{practice}} contributed to <b>the</b> generally <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion. <b>The</b> government is secular and the Ministry of Education asserts that {{public schools in the}} country are secular and that the law prohibits ideological and religious indoctrination. Religion is not taught in public schools.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion. The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E

25|$|Article 15 {{required}} the mandatory administration {{to see to}} it that complete freedom of conscience and <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> all forms of worship were permitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{court ruled}} that false {{imprisonment}} can exist even if the victim is not placed under arrest. It also found that <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution does not bar an action for fraud against a religious organization when that action implicates action, not belief.|$|R

5000|$|O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342 (1987), was a U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{involving the}} constitutionality of prison regulations.

50|$|On June 11, 1993, the Supreme Court {{unanimously}} reversed.

50|$|Jamison v. State of Texas, 318 U.S. 413 (1943), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that a Dallas city ordinance, which {{prohibited}} distribution of handbills on the streets, violated <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment because the material being distributed is religious in its nature.|$|R
25|$|The Irish Confederates {{were now}} much more {{amenable}} to compromise, as 1647 {{had seen a}} series of military disasters for them {{at the hands of}} English Parliamentarian forces. On 17 January 1649 Ormonde concluded a peace with the rebels on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> their religion.|$|E
25|$|Religious groups became {{concerned}} that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection. RFRA provided a strict scrutiny standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion, regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{recognized}} {{that under the}} First Amendment, the Congress cannot pass a law that prohibits <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion. However it held that the law prohibiting bigamy did not meet that standard. The principle that a person could only be married singly, not plurally, existed since the times of King James I of England in English law, upon which United States law was based.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan Supreme Court {{struck down}} the state's teacher {{certificate}} requirement as an unconstitutional abridgment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution's <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion clause. [...] The DeJonge's were convicted of teaching their children without a government issued teacher's certificate. [...] HSLDA represented the family in its appeals which established that parents do not need a teacher's certificate to teach their children.|$|R
50|$|Segraves v. California was a 1981 {{court case}} {{concerning}} {{the teaching of}} evolutionary biology in public schools. Kelly Segraves, parent of three schoolchildren, sued the State of California, arguing that it violated <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment to the US Constitution by teaching evolution. The judge found that California's anti-dogmatism policy gave sufficient accommodation to the views of Segraves.|$|R
50|$|Sherbert v. Verner, , {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Exercise</b> Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment {{required}} that the government demonstrate both a compelling interest and that the law in question be narrowly tailored, before denying unemployment compensation to someone who was fired because her job requirements substantially conflicted with her religion.|$|R
25|$|After the First World War (19141918), the {{teaching}} of creation and evolution in public education grew as a public controversy. By this time, many texts taught {{the theory of evolution}} as scientific fact. Many Christians in the U.S.A. and later Jews and Muslims, expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact, the State was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion, as in their opinion this taught their children that the Bible had been proven false.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me {{this is not something}} that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> their religion.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} {{the action of the}} Supreme Court of Illinois is {{contrary}} to the principles of that portion of the First Amendment which guarantees <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> religion. Of course, under our Constitutional system, men could not be excluded from the practice of law, or indeed from following any other calling, simply because they belong to any of our religious groups, whether Protestant, Catholic, Quaker, or Jewish, assuming it conceivable that any state of the Union would draw such a religious line. We cannot say that any such purpose to discriminate motivated the action of the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{conservative}} Christian right {{groups such}} as the Christian Legal Society and the Alliance Defense Fund have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and hate speech.
