5|$|At times, Beecher's has {{encountered}} challenges in maintaining this uniform standard. For example, when flooding affected one farm, <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> there produced enzymes in their milk that helped their calves {{to fight off}} bacteria, but changed {{the flavor of the}} milk.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{reports that}} the Crew Cut Man had no records on file with the FBI or other agencies. The {{material}} injected into <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> and children {{is found to be}} an unknown substance. All the children who were inoculated came down with a flu-like illness while those in the Church of the Red Museum did not, causing her to think they were a control group.

5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E
50|$|Taking pity on Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva {{assumed the}} forms of a cow and its calf to serve him. Lakshmi {{in the form of}} a cowherdess sold <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> and calf to the king of the Chola country. The Chola king sent them to graze on the Venkata Hill along with his herd of cattle. Discovering Vishnu on <b>the</b> ant-hill, <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> {{provided}} its milk, and thus fed him. Meanwhile, at <b>the</b> palace, <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> was not yielding any milk, for which the Chola queen chastised <b>the</b> royal <b>cow</b> herder severely. To find out the cause of lack of milk, <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> herder followed <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> secretly and discovered <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> emptying her udder over the ant-hill. Angered by the conduct of <b>the</b> <b>cow,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> herder flung his axe to harm <b>the</b> <b>cow.</b> However, Vishnu rose from the ant-hill to receive the blow and save <b>the</b> <b>cow.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> herder saw Vishnu bleed by the blow of his axe, he fell down and died of shock.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> elects {{to enter}} the milking unit (due to highly {{palatable}} feed that she finds in the milking box), a cow ID sensor reads an identification tag (transponder) on <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> and passes <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> ID to <b>the</b> control system. If <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> has been milked too recently, the automatic gate system sends <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> out of <b>the</b> unit. If <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> may be milked, automatic teat cleaning, milking cup application, milking, and teatspraying takes place. As an incentive to attend the milking unit, concentrated feedstuffs needs to be fed to <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> in <b>the</b> milking unit.|$|R
50|$|A farmer's best cow kept grazing in a fairy fort. It was unlucky for <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> {{to graze}} there but <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> pined {{when it was}} {{prevented}} from going to the fairy fort. One day the farmer found <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> there with broken legs. He killed <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> and his family ate the meat, some fresh and some salted. A year later <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> {{was seen in the}} fairy fort. The fairies told the farmer they had taken <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> because they needed the milk for their children. They had substituted an old stray horse and made the horse to be like <b>the</b> <b>cow.</b> <b>The</b> farmer took his cow home. He became very prosperous because the fairies supported him.|$|R
5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors. To lure them back, the children tie Cartman to a tree and, {{the next time he}} farts, a massive satellite dish emerges from his anus. The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> in the area, having found them to be the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops has an {{extended}} cameo, being sick with an unidentified disease. Its appearance {{was a particular}} logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected. The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kaua'i set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production. Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons. Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> near his workplace at Skywalker Ranch to create the Triceratops vocals.|$|E

25|$|Innovation in milking {{focused on}} mechanizing the milking parlor (known in Australia and New Zealand as a milking shed) to {{maximize}} the number of cows per operator which streamlined the milking process to permit cows to be milked as if on an assembly line, and to reduce physical stresses on the farmer by putting <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> on a platform slightly above the person milking <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> to eliminate having to constantly bend over. Many older and smaller farms still have tie-stall or stanchion barns, but worldwide a majority of commercial farms have parlors.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cow</b> is {{regarded}} as a sacred animal in Nepal. Hindus considers <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> as mother, and worship <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> as a form of Goddess. Killing cows is illegal in Nepal. Ram Lakhan Chaudhary was ex-vdc chief of Gaushala Bazar.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> {{which had}} a newborn calf and the {{frightening}} and powerful lion {{were taken to the}} square. The farmer ordered to tie the calf in a place near lion and <b>the</b> <b>cow.</b> <b>The</b> lion was very hungry and <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> was so angry when the lion began to attack <b>the</b> calf, <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> attacked <b>the</b> lion bravely and angrily and killed the lion just at first blow. Therefore it called Shirgav.|$|R
50|$|The {{next day}} Great Master Euijo {{followed}} the instructions {{he had received}} in the dream and went on a journey. <b>The</b> <b>cow</b> fell when while crossing Dalma Mountain, but got back up again and kept on going. <b>The</b> <b>cow</b> continued on {{for quite some time}} before again falling down.

25|$|In rotary parlors, <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> {{are loaded}} {{one at a}} time onto the {{platform}} as it rotates. The milker stands near the entry to the parlor and puts the cups on <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> as they move past. By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another milker or a machine removes the cups and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E
25|$|As of April 2013, {{the island}} had a {{population}} of 1,903; natives are traditionally nicknamed vaques after <b>the</b> <b>cows,</b> or else lapins after the many rabbits seen in the island. Formally, they are known as Ridunians, from the Latin Riduna.|$|E
50|$|The king {{faithfully}} served Nandini for twenty-one days. He slept where <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> slept, ate when <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> ate {{and washed}} <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> and took very {{good care of}} it. On the twenty-second day, when <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> was grazing in the field, a lion appeared suddenly and pounced to eat Nandini. The king tried to kill the lion but could not, because the lion {{happened to be a}} servant of Lord Shiva and he cast a spell on King Dileepa that made him motionless. The king wanted to protect <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> but could not do anything but speak. He begged the lion to spare <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> and eat him instead and bowed before the lion.|$|R
50|$|The cowherd {{investigating}} the cause, followed <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> and discovered <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> emptying her udder over the ant-hill. In his anger, the cowherd aimed a blow with his axe {{on the head}} of <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> but struck God who rose from the ant-hill to receive the blow and save <b>the</b> <b>cow.</b> On seeing Lord Vishnu bleeding, the cowherd fell down and died. On the death of <b>the</b> cowherd, <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> returned to <b>the</b> king with blood stains on her body, bellowing {{in the presence of the}} Chola King. An anxious king followed <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> to <b>the</b> scene of the incident. Near an ant-hill, the King found the cowherd lying dead on the ground.|$|R
25|$|This {{developed}} into the Surge hanging milker. Prior to milking a cow, a large wide leather strap called a surcingle was put around <b>the</b> <b>cow,</b> across <b>the</b> <b>cow's</b> lower back. <b>The</b> milker device and collection tank hung underneath <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> from <b>the</b> strap. This innovation allowed <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> {{to move around}} naturally during the milking process {{rather than having to}} stand perfectly still over a bucket on the floor.|$|R
25|$|Most Nuer {{people are}} named after their cattle. The boys usually chose {{the name of}} their {{favorite}} cattle based on the form and color of the ox. The girls are named after <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> that they milk. Sometimes the cow names are passed down.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August another herd {{within one}} of the {{protection}} zones showing symptoms of FMD was slaughtered on suspicion.

25|$|The {{pipeline}} allowed barn {{length to}} keep increasing and expanding, {{but after a}} point farmers started to milk <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> in large groups, filling the barn with one-half to one-third of the herd, milking the animals, and then emptying and refilling the barn. As herd sizes continued to increase, this evolved into the more efficient milking parlor.|$|E
40|$|About {{the middle}} of July, 1954, a Guernsey cow was noted to be off feed by the owner.

25|$|Bihu is {{a series}} of three {{prominent}} festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, rongali or bohag, celebrated with the coming of spring {{and the beginning of the}} sowing season; kongali or kati, the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the bhogali or magh, the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to rongali bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of <b>the</b> <b>cows),</b> when <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.|$|E
25|$|Talk 'Til <b>The</b> <b>Cows</b> Come Home - Two callers would {{compete to}} talk about a certain subject for as long as possible.

25|$|Research has incriminated Hydrotaea irritans as a vector {{of summer}} mastitis, a bovine {{infection}} {{that can be}} caused by multiple suspected bacteria. The research allowed flies inoculated with select bacteria from a sample representing summer mastitis to come in contact with the udders of cattle. The bacteria appeared in some of <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> and on the bodies of just over a third of the doctored flies. The evidence indicates that H. irritans transmits the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus indolicus, and Fusobacterium necrophorum.|$|E

25|$|The next 30 to 60 {{days of the}} {{lactation}} {{cycle is}} characterized by peak milk production levels. The amount of milk produced per day during this period varies considerably by breed and by individual cow depending on her body condition, genetics, health, and nutrition. During this period the body condition of <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> will suffer because <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> will draw on her body stores to maintain such high milk production. Food intake of <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> also will increase. After peak lactation, <b>the</b> <b>cow’s</b> milk production levels will slowly decline {{for the rest of}} the lactation cycle. The producer will often breed <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> soon after she leaves peak production. For a while, <b>the</b> <b>cow’s</b> food intake will remain high before also beginning a decline to pre lactation levels. After peak milk production her body condition will also steadily recover.|$|R
