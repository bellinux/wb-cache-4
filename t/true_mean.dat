2500|$|When {{the state}} {{transition}} and observation models—that is, the predict and update functions [...] and —are highly non-linear, the extended Kalman filter can give particularly poor performance. This {{is because the}} covariance is propagated through linearization of the underlying non-linear model. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) uses a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transform to pick a minimal set of sample points (called sigma points) around the mean. These sigma points are then propagated through the non-linear functions, from which a new mean and covariance estimate are then formed. The result is a filter which, for certain systems, more accurately estimates the <b>true</b> <b>mean</b> and covariance. [...] This can be verified with Monte Carlo sampling or Taylor series expansion of the posterior statistics. [...] In addition, this technique removes the requirement to explicitly calculate Jacobians, which for complex functions can be a difficult task in itself (i.e., requiring complicated derivatives if done analytically or being computationally costly if done numerically), if not impossible (if those functions are not differentiable).|$|E
