To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from the Bronx and the mainland United States.|$|E
5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} alluvial sediment {{to the floor of}} the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E

5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance from <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{fall of the}} Shevardino redoubt {{threw the}} Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack.|$|E

5|$|Upon leaving Delaware City, DE 9 {{continues}} west as Wrangle Hill Road, passing between PBF Energy's Delaware City Refinery to {{the north}} and farm fields to the south. The route turns north onto River Road to head into the oil refinery complex, with DE 72 continuing west on Wrangle Hill Road. Within the oil refinery, the road crosses Norfolk Southern's Reybold Running Track railroad line. DE 9 leaves the industrial area upon crossing marshy Red Lion Creek and continues into a mix of fields, woods, and marshland, with DE 9 Truck heading northwest on Hamburg Road. At this point, the route turns {{to the north}}east and passes between Ommelanden Park to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ommelanden Hunter Training Center to the east before running between residential subdivisions to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> northern training grounds for the Delaware National Guard to the east. DE 9 passes through wooded areas with some homes before continuing into industrial areas and crossing a railroad spur. The road continues into marshland immediately to the northwest of the Delaware River before entering New Castle.|$|E
5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the drive. Skyline Drive is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Piedmont to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including the Appalachian Trail, {{and it is also}} used for biking and horseback riding. Skyline Drive is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows.

5|$|Abaoji, {{who later}} became Emperor Taizu of Liao, was born in 872, {{the son of the}} chief of the Yila tribe. At that time, the Yila tribe was the largest and strongest of the eight {{affiliated}} Khitan tribes; however, the Great Khan, the overall leader of the Khitans, was drawn from the Yaolian lineage. In 901 Abaoji was elected to be the chief of the Yila tribe by its tribal council. By 903, Abaoji had been named the Yüyue, the overall military leader of the Khitans, subordinate only to the Great Khan. Four years later, in 907, Abaoji became the Great Khan of the Khitans, ending nine generations of Yaolian rule. Abaoji acquired the prestige needed to secure the position of Khitan Great Khan through a combination of effective diplomacy and a series of successful military campaigns, beginning in 901, against the Han Chinese forces to the south, the Xi and Shiwei to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jurchens in the east.|$|E
5|$|Anti-communist {{resistance}} in Poland was also bolstered, {{and a group}} of opposition leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub Krzywego Koła (Skewed Wheel Club) in Warsaw. It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy, and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of {{reaching}} peak intensity, Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. The increasing size began to impart wind shear in Typhoon Nat to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. After maintaining peak winds for about 30hours, Mireille began weakening, passing just east of Miyako-jima on September26 with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph), according to the JMA. That day, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due to increasing mid-level winds from the southwest, passing west of Okinawa. According to the JMA, Mireille re-intensified slightly on September27 to a secondary peak of 175km/h (110mph), aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea. The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07:00UTC between Saikai and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu. The pressure at landfall was , {{the lowest in the}} country since Typhoon Trix in 1971.|$|E
