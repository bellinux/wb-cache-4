5|$|During {{the early}} 1930s Butlin joined {{the board of}} Harry Warner's holiday camp company (now Warner Leisure Hotels) and in 1935 he {{observed}} the construction of Warner's holiday camp in Seaton, Devon. Butlin learned {{from the experience of}} Warner, and employed <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> had constructed the Seaton camp to come to Lincolnshire to build his new camp at Skegness.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> were making the tubes.|$|E
50|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> {{killed by}} <b>the</b> Army was Vasile Roaită, a 19-year-old worker whose image {{was used by}} the early Communist regime as a martyr. He was alleged to have been <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> <b>who</b> sounded <b>the</b> siren to {{announce}} the strike to the neighbourhood. However, in 1997, another worker, Constantin Negrea, said that he was in fact <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> <b>who</b> sounded it and that in 1944, Gheorghiu-Dej and Chivu Stoica asked him to give up his claim in order that Roaită be a hero after his death.|$|R

5|$|The February Revolution {{halted the}} Finnish {{economic}} boom {{caused by the}} Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high inflation, but <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> had a job gained an opportunity to resolve long-term problems of their laborious working life. The commoners call for eight-hour-per-day working limits, better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E

5|$|No.1 Long Range Flight {{undertook}} {{intensive training}} in the lead-up to the race. This involved making regular long range return flights between Laverton and Ceylon, Singapore and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia. These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices {{that would be used}} in the race. As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records, setting the fastest time for crossing the Tasman Sea during a flight between RAAF Base Amberley and Christchurch on 16August. An aeronautical engineer was attached to No.1 Long Range Flight from the Department of Air to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take. On 2September Cuming and Raw visited the Government Aircraft Factories facility at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne to thank <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} moments that brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by Andrew Carnegie {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out <b>the</b> <b>workers,</b> <b>who</b> immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E

25|$|Four {{inscriptions}} {{have been}} found in the temple, on two small human statues and on either side of a small stone sphinx. They are crudely done, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> made them were illiterate apart from this script.|$|E

25|$|The {{indictment}} of Zörgiebel {{was rejected by}} the state prosecutors and Litten appealed. Zörgiebel turned around and filed charges against a <b>worker</b> <b>who</b> had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> had acted out of justifiable anger about Zörgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence {{on the grounds that the}} 33-count murder indictment against Zörgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> <b>who</b> had hit Zörgiebel on the ear.|$|R

25|$|Behaviorally {{dominant}} queens {{are standard}} among other primitively eusocial wasps, but in R. marginata, it is <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> engage in subordinate-dominant behavior.

Worker dominant-subordinate interactions seem to regulate foraging behavior.|$|E
25|$|Workers are {{observed}} returning {{to places where}} they had previously found food. The foraging success for an individual, which is measured by how many workers return with prey, would be 28%. About 41% of <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> were returning from foraging were empty handed and the other 31% had no prey or the prey {{was too small to}} be distinguished.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the opening}} of the labor market in the European Union, Poland {{experienced}} a mass emigration of over 2.3 million abroad, mainly due to higher wages offered abroad, and due to the raise in levels of unemployment following the global Great Recession of 2008.
