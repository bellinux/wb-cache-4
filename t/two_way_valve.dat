40|$|A {{process and}} {{apparatus}} are described for producing hydrogen-rich product gases. A spray of liquid hydrocarbon {{is mixed with}} a stream of air in a startup procedure and the mixture is ignited for partial oxidation. The stream of air is then heated by the resulting combustion to reach a temperature such that a signal is produced. The signal triggers a <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> which directs liquid hydrocarbon from a spraying mechanism to a vaporizing mechanism with which a vaporized hydrocarbon is formed. The vaporized hydrocarbon is subsequently mixed with the heated air in the combustion chamber where partial oxidation takes place and hydrogen-rich product gases are produced...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{technical}} subjects in commissioning for HVAC system is to enhance control performance and time efficiency, while the tuning of the optimal parameters to control HVAC system takes much time and labor in particular. Therefore, we propose a kind of commissioning technique as follows. We identified the dynamic characteristics of components of an actual VAV HVAC system such as rooms, VAV dampers, <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>valves</b> and chilled water coils, and verified the behaviors of the models and choose the optimal control parameters on a personal computer.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 This thesis {{presents}} a novel microlamination architecture {{that enables the}} large scale integration of valves into low cost micro energy and chemical systems via membrane entrapment. Polycarbonate layers embossed with microfluidic channels were bonded by ultrasonic welding of raised embossed protrusions that penetrate though the PDMS membranes. The bonding pressure compresses the membranes and forms a conformal seal across the interface of the PDMS and polycarbonate effectively sealing the fluidic channels up to 22 PSI fluid pressure. When deflected into the microchannels by pneumatic pressure the membrane acts as proportional flow control and shut off valves. The architecture gives additional design freedom {{in the selection of}} materials since membranes can be entrapped in polymers that are incompatible for traditional bonding methods. The combination of high modulus polycarbonate layers with low modulus PDMS layers increases spatial intensification over monolithic PDMS microdevices that rely on bulk for rigidity. The ability to number up the layers for high throughput was demonstrated as well as the potential for <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>valves</b> and pumping mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the working}} {{process of the}} <b>two</b> <b>way</b> {{cartridge}} <b>valve,</b> deformation and stress are generated by {{the effect of the}} changed internal fluid pressures. In this process, the flow of the liquid flowing through the cross section also changes with it. To analyse the stress and deformation distributions of the cartridge valve under the different pressures and the flow analysis in different flow rates and different pressures, finite element method has been used in this paper for analysis and calculation in order to find the structure weak part, the instable flow rate region and the part which hinder the flow rate increased. The results show that: the phenomenon of stress concentration significantly existed in the opening part on the outlet side of the two-way cartridge valve. Under the maximum operating pressure (the maximum working pressure is 31. 5 MPa, the maximum flow rate is 4500 L / min), the deformation was larger in the part of girdle. There was nearly no deformation on the upside of the valve body and the stress was less. So, the valve body was the redundant part of two-way cartridge valves. The instable flow rate region was located in the region of the two-way cartridge valve opening across. In the junction of the export of plug-in mounting component and the plug-in mounting block, the flow of liquid was impeded because of its much block and angular structure. The analysis results above have laid a theoretical foundation for the fatigue strength analysis and structural optimization of two-way cartridge valves...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} problems with these valves. One {{is that the}} chest tube can clog. When chest tube clogging occurs, the pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema can recur.

To address this, some have turned to small chest drainage alternatives, such as the Atrium Express Mini 500 or the Teleflex Mini Sahara. An alternative solution is to attach a sputum trap to the valve, thus providing a reservoir to capture the draining fluid. The Atrium Pneumostat chest drain valve combines a one <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> and a 30cc collection chamber to address this issue.|$|R
