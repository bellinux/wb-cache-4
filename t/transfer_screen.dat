40|$|Regulators of G protein {{signaling}} (RGS) proteins are potent negative modulators of G protein signaling {{and have}} been proposed as potential targets for small-molecule inhibitor development. We report a high-throughput time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy <b>transfer</b> <b>screen</b> to identify inhibitors of RGS 4 and describe the first reversible small-molecule inhibitors of an RGS protein. Two closely related compounds, typified by CCG- 63802 [((2 E) - 2 -(1, 3 -benzothiazol- 2 -yl) - 3 -[9 -methyl- 2 -(3 -methylphenoxy) - 4 -oxo- 4 H-pyrido[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 3 -yl]prop- 2 -enenitrile) ], inhibit the interaction between RGS 4 and G alpha(o) with an IC 50 value in the low micromolar range. They show selectivity among RGS proteins with a potency order of RGS 4 > 19 = 16 > 8 >> 7. The compounds inhibit the GTPase accelerating protein activity of RGS 4, and thermal stability studies demonstrate binding to the RGS but not to G alpha(o). On RGS 4, they depend on an interaction {{with one or more}} cysteines in a pocket that has previously been identified as an allosteric site for RGS regulation by acidic phospholipids. Unlike previous small-molecule RGS inhibitors identified to date, these compounds retain substantial activity under reducing conditions and are fully reversible on the 10 -min time scale. CCG- 63802 and related analogs represent a useful step toward the development of chemical tools for the study of RGS physiology...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{supply is}} crucial in {{industrial}} application of microbial systems, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, but oxygen transfer is often neglected in early strain characterizations, typically done under aerobic conditions. In this work, a new procedure for oxygen <b>transfer</b> <b>screening</b> is presented, assessing the impact of maximum oxygen transfer conditions (OTRmax) within microtiter plate-based cultivation for enhanced throughput. Oxygen-dependent growth and productivity were characterized for C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and C. glutamicum DM 1933 (lysine producer). Biomass and lysine product yield are affected at OTRmax below 14 mmol L− 1 h− 1 in a standardized batch process, but not by further increase of OTRmax above this threshold value indicating a reasonable tradeoff between power input and oxygen transfer capacity OTRmax. The described oxygen <b>transfer</b> <b>screening</b> allows comparative determination of metabolic robustness against oxygen transfer limitation and serves identification of potential problems or opportunities later created during scale-up...|$|R

In this work the feasibility of Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) technique was investigated for <b>transferring</b> <b>screen</b> printing silver paste. It was possible to print several droplets at different laser pulse energies for a certain donor-acceptor gap. After that, two studies were carried out: {{the analysis of the}} deposited droplets and the characterization of the dynamics of the material transfer. An approximately linear trend in the radius-energy dependence was observed, and thicknesses of the printed droplets were of the order of a few microns. The transfer dynamics was characterized by means of a time-resolved imaging method, showing three different stages on the bubble evolution: bubble expansion, bubble burst and bubble retraction. Jet formation never took place as it happens in low-viscosity inks. Results in both experiments were conclusive and consistent with each othe...|$|R
40|$|C 60 layers on {{polycrystalline}} Ag and Au are {{studied by}} photoelectron spectroscopy. At these metal/C 60 interfaces an electron transfer occurs from the metal {{to the lowest}} unoccupied orbital of C 60. We found {{in the case of}} the polycrystalline Ag/C 60 interface a dipolar layer with its associated electric field in the direction corresponding to the charge transfer, so pointing from the substrate to the adsorbent. Yet, at the Au/C 60 interface we observed an overall electric field pointing from C 60 towards the metal. We discuss our observations in terms of charge <b>transfer,</b> <b>screening</b> and hybridization effects and propose the occurrence of a hybridization mechanism similar to back-bonding at the Au/C 60 interface. We show that the alignment of energy levels at the metal/C 60 interface cannot simply be deduced using the metal workfunction and the frontier orbitals of C 60, including screening effects, since hybridization effects may strongly alter the interfacial energy level structure. Our experimental findings on the polycrystalline metal/C 60 interfaces indicate an at-most weak dependence of the Fermi level of the C 60 overlayer on the workfunction of the polycrystalline metal substrate. These interfaces are found in donor–acceptor-based organic photovoltaic devices and our results may help to understand the electrical characteristics of these devices. ...|$|R
40|$|The d-orbital {{contribution}} from the transition metal centers of phthalocyanine brings difficulties {{to understand the}} role of the organic ligands and their molecular frontier orbitals when it adsorbs on oxide surfaces. Here we use zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) /TiO 2 (110) as a model system where the zinc d-orbitals are located deep below the organic orbitals leaving room for a detailed study of the interaction between the organic ligand and the substrate. A charge depletion from the highest occupied molecular orbital is observed, and a consequent shift of N 1 s and C 1 s to higher binding energy in photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). A detailed comparison of peak shifts in PES and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy illustrates a slightly uneven charge distribution within the molecular plane and an inhomogeneous charge <b>transfer</b> <b>screening</b> between the center and periphery of the organic ligand: faster in the periphery and slower at the center, which is different from other metal phthalocyanine, e. g., FePc/TiO 2. Our results indicate that the metal center can substantially influence the electronic properties of the organic ligand at the interface by introducing an additional charge transfer channel to the inner molecular part.

40|$|Comparative {{genomics}} {{have revealed}} massive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between Mycoplasma species sharing common ruminant hosts. Further results pointed toward an integrative conjugative element (ICE) {{as an important}} contributor of HGT in the small-ruminant-pathogen Mycoplasma agalactiae. To estimate the prevalence of ICEs in ruminant mycoplasmas, we surveyed their occurrence {{in a collection of}} 166 field strains representing 4 (sub) species that are recognized as major pathogens. Based on available sequenced genomes, we first defined the conserved, minimal ICE backbone as composed of 4 coding sequences (CDSs) that are evenly distributed and predicted to be essential for ICE chromosomal integration-excision and horizontal <b>transfer.</b> <b>Screening</b> of the strain collection revealed that these 4 CDSs are well represented in ruminant Mycoplasma species, suggesting widespread occurrence of ICEs. Yet their prevalence varies within and among species, with no correlation found with the individual strain history. Extrachromosomal ICE forms were also often detected, suggesting that ICEs are able to circularize in all species, a first and essential step in ICE horizontal transfer. Examination of the junction of the circular forms and comparative sequence analysis of conserved CDSs clearly pointed toward two types of ICE, the hominis and spiroplasma types, most likely differing in their mechanism of excision-integration. Overall, our data indicate the occurrence and maintenance of functional ICEs in a large number of field isolates of ruminant mycoplasmas. These may contribute to genome plasticity and gene exchanges and, presumably, to the emergence of diverse genotypes within pathogenic mycoplasmas of veterinary importance...|$|R
