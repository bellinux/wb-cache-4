DynCorp was made responsible for individual training and PA unit training. In June–July 2005 the projected force strength {{was reduced to}} 2000 men. DynCorp and the U.S. Embassy scrutinized the personnel for the new armed forces thoroughly. Recruits had to pass a literacy test, an aptitude test, a drug test and an HIV test, and their names and faces were put on posters which are distributed to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> none {{have a history of}} war crimes or other human rights violations. A new batch of 500 screened personnel started to arrive at the Camp Ware base at VOA Careysburg, inland from Monrovia, for initial training in early November 2007, joining 608 others who had graduated earlier.|$|E

The album opens with the parody [...] "Couch Potato", a play on Eminem's [...] "Lose Yourself", the {{critically}} acclaimed single from the film 8 Mile (2002). In Yankovic's version, the singer describes his obsession with watching television; the song references many TV shows, as well as cable and network channels. Prior to recording [...] "Couch Potato", Yankovic researched television so that his resulting parody would be accurate. He noted, “If I'm writing a song about TV, I'll {{spend a lot of time}} watching TV.

2500|$|Lisa Evans, an {{attorney}} for the environmental group Earthjustice (headquartered in Oakland, CA), spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the industry for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases. She stated that [...] "The saddest thing is this is entirely avoidable. These people in these communities don't have to be in harm's way. This is not some complicated problem like nuclear waste. This is something the utilities know how to do." [...] Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told The New York Times that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that [...] "I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site." [...] Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA’s own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells.“Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes of this thing and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it never happens again,” he said. Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site. The site may be slated as a Superfund site, although no decision regarding this has yet been made. On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told The Tennessean newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what is in it, due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain [...] "hot spots" [...] of higher toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1955 general election, Attlee {{retired as}} leader. Bevan contested the {{leadership}} against both Morrison and Labour right-winger Hugh Gaitskell, {{but it was}} Gaitskell who emerged victorious. Bevan's remark that [...] "I know {{the right kind of}} political Leader for the Labour Party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine" [...] was assumed to refer to Gaitskell, although Bevan denied it (commenting upon Gaitskell's record as Chancellor of the Exchequer as having [...] "proved" [...] this). However, Gaitskell was prepared to make Bevan Shadow Colonial Secretary, and then Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1956. Bevan was as critical of the Egyptian dictator Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 as he was of the subsequent Anglo-French military response. He compared Nasser with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. He was a vocal critic of the Conservative government's actions in the Suez Crisis, noticeably delivering high-profile speeches in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956 at a protest rally, and criticising the government's actions and arguments in Commons on 5 December 1956. At the Trafalgar rally, Bevan accused the government of a [...] "policy of bankruptcy and despair". Bevan stated at the Trafalgar rally: We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are we prepared to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at least make common sense to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force {{in the case of a}} small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony, I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud. They have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out! Get out! Get out!
