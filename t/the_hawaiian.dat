5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt created <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), {{which is}} under the {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> monk seal further protection.|$|E

The best known player to play for <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> was former Dallas Cowboys running back Calvin Hill, though quarterback Jim Fassel became better known {{as a head coach}} decades later. <b>The</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> head coach was Michael Giddings who guided <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> through both <b>the</b> 1974 and 1975 World Football League seasons.|$|R

5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; this suggests that <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> archipelago. Monk seals {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

As it moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands; on 22 August John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h). Also on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.|$|E

After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands.
