These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church later allowed {{polyphonic}} {{arrangements to}} replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like Palestrina or Mozart, features a Kyrie but not an Introit. <b>The</b> <b>Propers</b> may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of <b>the</b> <b>Propers</b> were William Byrd and Tomás Luis de Victoria.

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{is measured}} by the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. <b>The</b> <b>proper</b> motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E
