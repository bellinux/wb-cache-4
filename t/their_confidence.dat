5|$|Once in Vanilla Studios, {{the group}} began {{performing}} cover songs {{from a variety}} of genres, such as rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band to rebuild <b>their</b> <b>confidence</b> without worrying about the reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band's punk rock musical style.|$|E
5|$|Shulaprota (pierced by sharp pointed spear/dart): Some {{people give}} shelter to birds or animals {{pretending to be}} their saviours, but then harass them poking with threads, needles or using them like lifeless toys. Also, some people behave the same way to humans, winning <b>their</b> <b>confidence</b> and then killing them with sharp tridents or lances. The bodies of such sinners, {{fatigued}} with hunger and thirst, are pierced with sharp, needle-like spears. Ferocious carnivorous birds like vultures and herons tear and gorge their flesh.|$|E

5|$|Author John Green, {{though an}} Indianapolis native, {{was pleased with}} the {{selection}} of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, <b>their</b> <b>confidence,</b> their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by <b>their</b> <b>confidence</b> in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm I granted Charlotte and Bernhard a villa near Tiergarten in Berlin and {{transferred}} Bernhard to a regiment in the city. Charlotte {{spent much of}} her time socialising with other ladies, where it was common to pursue activities such as skating, gossiping, and holding dinner parties. She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked and drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning <b>their</b> <b>confidence,</b> only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E

5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, {{laid out in a}} thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to <b>their</b> <b>confidence</b> and support of Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E

25|$|During 2006 and 2007, rumours {{circulated}} in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could {{be moved to}} another country. Franz Beckenbauer, Horst R.

25|$|Donkeys have {{a notorious}} {{reputation}} for stubbornness, {{but this has}} been attributed to a much stronger sense of self-preservation than exhibited by horses. Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned <b>their</b> <b>confidence</b> they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Robert Lucas of the Chicago {{school of}} {{economics}} introduced the Lucas critique, which called into question the logic behind Keynesian macroeconomic policy making. The new classical economics became the dominant school in macroeconomics. By the mid-1970s, policy makers were beginning to lose <b>their</b> <b>confidence</b> in the effectiveness of government intervention in the economy. In 1976 British Prime Minister James Callaghan said that the option of “spending {{our way out of}} recession” no longer exists.|$|E

25|$|The authors say the {{previous}} Fourth Turning in the US {{began with the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929 and climaxed {{with the end of}} World War II. The G.I.

Each component in this mixture represents a tree structured temporal linkage between super-pixels {{from the first}} to the last frame of a video sequence.

We provide a variational inference scheme for this model to estimate super-pixel labels and <b>their</b> <b>confidences</b> in nearly realtime. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated via quantitative comparisons on the challenging SegTrack joint segmentation and tracking dataset [23]. ...|$|R
