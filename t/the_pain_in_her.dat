25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost feel <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E

I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E

60|$|Liza {{did not get}} up all day. Tom came {{to inquire}} after her, and was told she was very ill. Liza plaintively asked whether anyone else had been, and sighed a little when her mother {{answered}} no. But she felt too ill to think much or trouble much about anything. The fever came again as the day wore on, and <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> head grew worse. Her mother came to bed, and quickly went off to sleep, leaving Liza to bear her agony alone. She began to have frightful pains all over her, and {{she held her breath}} to prevent herself from crying out and waking her mother. She clutched the sheets <b>in</b> <b>her</b> agony, and at last, about six o'clock in the morning, she could bear it no longer, and in the anguish of labour screamed out, and woke her mother.|$|R

50|$|For the 2010-11 Grand Prix season, Virtue/Moir were {{assigned}} to the 2010 Skate Canada International and to the 2010 Trophée Eric Bompard.

Tensions rapidly grow after Nettie Cobb, Polly's housekeeper, and her enemy Wilma Jerzyck kill each other in a confrontation sparked by pranks played on them by others.

60|$|In {{spite of}} the rough {{handling}} she had been subjected to, and <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arm, Fan very soon recovered her composure.

60|$|Gradually {{her tears}} ceased to flow, the heavy sobs were stilled, her aching and bruised body felt numb with <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart.

60|$|A queer feeling {{caught at}} her heart {{as the car}} glided off and left him {{standing}} there, bareheaded.

5000|$|The {{translation}} {{fell into}} obscurity {{as it was}} for the most part too literal and lacked any flow. For example, Jer. 22:23 was given as follows: [...] "Thou dwelling in Lebanon, building as nest in the cedars, how being compassionated in pangs coming to thee <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> as <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bringing forth." [...] However, the translation was the only Contemporary English translation out of the original languages available to English readers until the publication of The British revised Version in 1881-1894.(The New testament was published in 1881, the Old in 1884, and the Apocrypha in 1894.) This makes it an invaluable Bible for its period.|$|R

60|$|Now Muriel Gascoyne had no very keen perceptions, and was, moreover, {{wrapped up}} in her own and Jefferson's affairs, or she might have seen that anger was not all that Jacinta was feeling.

60|$|Not till Una {{had promised}} {{that she would}} not summon the doctor was her mother quieted, though Una made the promise with reservations. She {{relieved}} <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's side with ice compresses--the ice chipped from the pitiful little cake in their tiny ice-box. She freshened pillows, she smoothed sheets; she made hot broth and bathed her mother's shoulders with tepid water and rubbed her temples with menthol. But the fever increased, and at times Mrs. Golden broke through her shallow slumber with meaningless sentences, like the beginning of delirium.|$|E

Beyond <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> head, she was conscious of no physical ill; she felt at perfect peace, and an extraordinary sense of quiet and repose seemed to pervade this small room, with its narrow window through which the {{rays of the sun}} came gradually in more golden splendour as the day drew towards noon, and then they vanished altogether.|$|E
5000|$|The first recitative [...] "Che vidi oh Ciel" [...] is notated {{with a key}} {{signature}} of one flat and suggests {{to be in the}} key of d minor. The violins and basso continuo open in B-flat unison as the soprano joins on a B diminished chord. The soprano sings: [...] "Heavens! Oh Heavens! Tirsi is languishing, and his face darkens with sorrow. Beside him, his faithful consort piteously expresses in a sad song <b>the</b> harsh <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart, which arouses her bitter weeping. Or else, remaining silent, her glance seems to speak to him, saying [...] "Are you leaving me and abandoning me?" [...] The recitative continues with the minor feel and does not sound like d minor until the last six measures, showing clear cadential movement in the accompaniment to a half cadence.|$|R

He was so much exhausted as to be almost unconscious; but the next morning, when Anne, against the persuasions of her hostess, had risen and been dressed, though still feeling weak and shaken, she received a message, begging her to do him the great kindness of visiting him.|$|E

In the extremity of her distress she could find no words to pray for relief, she knew of no heaven to send her prayer to, and she wandered on with tired feet in the dumb surprise and terror at the injustice of the suffering inflicted upon her without cause and without redress.|$|E
