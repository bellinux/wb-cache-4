5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E
5|$|Katharine Houghton Hepburn (May 12, 1907– June 29, 2003) was an American actress.

She appeared {{in a range of}} genres, from screwball comedy <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> drama, and she received four Academy Awards—a record for any performer—for Best Actress.

5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, {{writes that the}} poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis on}} aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in the midst of natural beauty. According <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> documentarian H.B. Jassin, the poems, though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E
5|$|Maximian's campaigns {{were not}} {{proceeding}} as smoothly.

Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate. Carausius fled the Continent, proclaimed himself Augustus, and agitated Britain and northwestern Gaul into open revolt against Maximian and Diocletian.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{uncovered}} after Lie's {{death in}} 1912 suggested that Siti Akbari was {{heavily influenced by}} the earlier Sjair Abdoel Moeloek (1847), variously credited to Raja Ali Haji or Saleha. This tale was transliterated by Arnold Snackey, then later translated into Sundanese. Sources disagree on the translator. The documentarian Christiaan Hooykaas, writing in a letter <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> critic Nio Joe Lan, suggested that Lie's inspiration {{had come from a}} version of Sjair Abdoel Moeloek held in the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences Library in Batavia. Biographer Tio Ie Soei, meanwhile, suggested that the version which inspired Lie was translated in 1873 by Lie's teacher, Sierk Coolsma. According to Tio, Coolsma had based his translation off a stage performance and written it hurriedly, such that it was nearly illegible. As he had better handwriting, Lie purportedly copied the story for Coolsma and kept the original in his own collection. The literary historian Monique Zaini-Lajoubert writes that none of these intermediary versions has been found.|$|E
5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog is full of allusions <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> works, music, films, and paintings. It {{incorporates}} themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through the thoughts and reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E
5|$|Female virtue {{was tied}} <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> {{knowledge}} in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century {{they had come to}} symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kanō Tan'yū as a wedding gift in 1649.|$|E

5|$|In 1877, List's father died. List soon {{abandoned}} the leather goods business that he inherited, intent on devoting himself <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> endeavours as a journalist, {{even if this}} meant {{a significant reduction in}} his income. On 26 September 1878 he married his first wife, Helene Förster-Peters. From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines Neue Welt ("New World"), Heimat ("Homeland"), Deutsche Zeitung ("German Newspaper"), and the Neue Deutsche Alpenzeitung ("New German Alpine Newspaper"), with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants. His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place-names, customs, and legends, describing the landscape as being embodied by genius loci, and expressing clear German nationalist and völkisch sentiment.|$|E
5|$|Ion Creangă {{was born}} in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been {{incorporated}} into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into {{what was then the}} principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of transhumance and the links between ethnic Romanian communities {{on both sides of the}} mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants, while, according <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> historian George Călinescu, his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} <b>to</b> <b>literary</b> history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The Wrath of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} again {{served as}} a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated {{to the first floor}} of Literary Hall from its previous facility {{in the basement of the}} Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary, and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move <b>to</b> <b>Literary</b> Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration.|$|E
5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index <b>to</b> <b>Literary</b> Sources in Film. The same work also credits Alphonse Ethier with a role, but this is not cited by Bowers.|$|E
