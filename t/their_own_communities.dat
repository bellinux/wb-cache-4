25|$|After World War II, {{immigration}} {{from the former}} British Empire was largely driven by labour shortages. Like {{the rest of the}} Indian subcontinent diaspora, Dalits immigrated and established <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jews who {{migrated}} to ancient Persia mostly lived in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> The Persian Jewish communities include the ancient (and until the mid-20th century still-extant) communities {{not only of}} Iran, but also the Azerbaijani, Armenian, Georgian, Iraqi, Bukharan, and Mountain Jewish communities.|$|E

25|$|The policemen, however, {{received}} no extra {{pay for the}} hazardous duty which left them vulnerable to attack nor for the regular breaking up of strikers' pickets; both of which threatened to alienate them from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> {{and in some cases}} their own families.|$|E
25|$|As the American colonies came to {{identify}} more with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> {{and the concept}} of liberty, rather than as vassals of the British empire, icons that were unique to the Americas became increasingly popular. The rattlesnake, like the bald eagle and American Indian, came to symbolize American ideals and society.|$|E
25|$|Antisemitism {{has been}} {{explained}} in terms of racism, xenophobia, projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a scapegoat. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of Jewish people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> with their own practices and laws.|$|E

25|$|The Lebanese {{court system}} {{consists}} of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.|$|E
25|$|The {{immigration}} routes {{still have}} an effect today. Immigrants often formed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, such as Dutch, German, Polish, Finnish, and many others. Since many immigrants settled {{for a time in}} New England before moving westward, many areas on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.|$|E

25|$|Much of Indigenous {{feminism}} {{has taken}} shape around issues {{that resulted from}} colonial practices. Indigenous feminism {{is a direct result}} of, and a direct answer to the colonization and continued oppression of Indigenous peoples around the world. The need to question cultural practices from within allows Indigenous women to actively shape <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> and helps encourage self-determination and cultural ownership. Differentiating Indigenous feminism from white feminism illuminates the ways that white feminism does not fully account for Indigenous experiences.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, the Panama YMCA {{was given}} its {{first piece of}} property, a 40-acre (16 ha) piece of land for a day camping and nature centre site, {{allowing}} it to expand its programmes. The camp allowed the Panama YMCA to expand a great deal and became a major resource for various programmes. The camp also {{was used as a}} conference centre. The National Volunteers used it as a leadership training area, learning community development techniques that they could take back to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> The Girl and Boy Scouts as well as church groups also used the area.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{geography}} is often {{considered part of}} a broader postmodern approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and social studies, arguing that academic traditions are delineated by patriarchy, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.|$|E
25|$|While {{civilian}} communities {{had organized}} {{ways to deal}} with the care and transportation of the sick and dying {{as far back as the}} bubonic plague in London between 1598 and 1665, such arrangements were typically ad hoc and temporary. In time, however, these arrangements began to formalize and become permanent. During the American Civil War, Jonathan Letterman devised a system of mobile field hospitals employing the first uses of the principles of triage. After returning home, some veterans began to attempt to apply what had they had seen on the battlefield to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> and commenced the creation of volunteer life-saving squads and ambulance corps.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder {{architect}} Elias Messinas met {{the late}} Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy - author of Architecture for the Poor - in Cairo. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them {{housing for the}} poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community</b> and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with <b>their</b> work <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community.</b>|$|R

25|$|The boatmen (usually {{with their}} families) were a rough {{independent}} lot, forming a class within themselves, and intermarrying {{within their own}} group. They frequently fought amongst each other for any reason, be it racial slurs (real or perceived), precedence at a lock, or for exercise. They fought with lockkeepers over company rules, or even with the company for changes in toll rates. During winter when the boats were tied up, they often lived in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> away from others. One boat captain observed that on the canal, {{women and children were}} as good as the men, and if weren't for the children, the canal wouldn't run one day.|$|E
25|$|Deaf-community sign languages, on {{the other}} hand, arise where deaf people come {{together}} to form <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> These include school sign, such as Nicaraguan Sign Language, which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as Bamako Sign Language, which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, {{as in the case}} of ASL.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small {{immigrant}} communities of Spaniards, Italians, Basque and Lebanese. African slaves were imported to Mexico through the Veracruz port. At one point, they outnumbered Europeans {{and a significant}} number ran away from haciendas and plantations to form <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> sometimes allied with indigenous groups. One such rebellion was led by Yanga, who successfully negotiated a free African community with Spanish authorities in 1609. Like other groups, many of African descent would intermarry with other groups, with the category of “mulatto” existing in the old colonial caste system for those with African blood. Today, {{the vast majority of}} Afro Mexicans in Veracruz {{and other parts of the}} country are spread out and intermixed with the rest of the population.|$|E
