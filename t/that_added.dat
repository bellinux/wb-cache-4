5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence <b>that</b> <b>added</b> more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E

5|$|Rare, who had {{previously}} developed the Donkey Kong Country games, began development on the 3D Donkey Kong in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare's Banjo group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by Nintendo for North America in November and worldwide by December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console's Expansion Pak, an accessory <b>that</b> <b>added</b> memory resources. The game had an exceptionally large marketing budget that included advertisements, sweepstakes, and a national tour.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers made {{positive}} {{remarks about}} the game's orchestral score and voice acting. Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote <b>that</b> <b>added</b> choral tracks during intense in-game moments gave the game epic overtones, though Clayman (IGN) thought the score made the game environments feel delusively majestic. Bramwell (Eurogamer) found little joy in the verbose dialogue, which he often skipped even during important scenes, but Kasavin (GameSpot) considered the voice acting amusing, with good quality. He also praised the level of nuance in the sound effects, such as those made as characters walked.|$|E
5|$|Team Ninja {{continued}} {{to update the}} game after its release: two Hurricane Packs were made available as free downloadable content <b>that</b> <b>added</b> extra content, gameplay challenges, and game engine improvements. These were incorporated into a reworked version, released in 2005 and entitled Ninja Gaiden Black, that was regarded by the game's creator Tomonobu Itagaki and many players as the definitive version. In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was graphically enhanced on the PlayStation 3, with extra content, {{in the form of}} Ninja Gaiden Sigma. This version was later released on the PlayStation Vita as Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus.|$|E

40|$|Programs can be {{composed}} by successively applying transformations <b>that</b> <b>add</b> features to a code base. These transformations must apply without errors but we cannot test every combination of them. We must detect errors automatically to encapsulate single transformations and scale them. Prior work focused on transformations <b>that</b> monotonically <b>add</b> code {{in order to}} produce program variants. We generalized their work in that we automatically detect composition errors for transformations <b>that</b> <b>add</b> and remove code. Specifically, we detect errors for automated refactorings that transform a program when selected. The generalization is important to detect errors for modules <b>that</b> <b>add</b> and remove code. As a result, we can now guarantee that refactorings and sequences of refactorings compose without errors in featureoriented designs. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{by a team of}} twelve people, who took two months to make a playable demo and three more to finish the game. Infinity Blade was intended to demonstrate the new iOS version of the Unreal Engine, and to combine the swordplay of Karateka and Prince of Persia with the loneliness of Shadow of the Colossus. The game received four free expansions <b>that</b> <b>added</b> new equipment, endings, and game modes.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available <b>that</b> <b>added</b> support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E

5|$|An {{enhanced}} PC version titled Cave Story+ {{was released}} by Nicalis on the Steam service on 22 November 2011. Cave Story+ features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, {{as well as the}} option to toggle the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. Recently the game got an update <b>that</b> <b>added</b> exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story + on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase <b>that</b> <b>added</b> a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} {{once again}} threatened the amazon {{during the following}} years. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species. Via Verde, a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis Fortuño administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed. New conservation efforts have also begun during this timeframe. In 2011, a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez sequenced the amazon's genome. On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced. Experts considered this a sign of expansion, impliying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted <b>that</b> <b>added</b> to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, <b>that</b> <b>added</b> a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something <b>that</b> <b>added</b> realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system <b>that</b> <b>added</b> points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E
