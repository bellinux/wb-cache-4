5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Leá Monde.

5|$|There is no ethical {{cohesion}} {{within the}} New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff {{argued that the}} central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.

5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes {{may be the result}} of rare storm winds <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Neptune has {{a profound effect}} on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|E

In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed {{over and over again}} until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped {{in the middle of it}} all.|$|E

5|$|Vagrant Story (1999) is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game featuring no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, {{as well as}} elements of puzzle-solving and strategy.

The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba.

5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The Injustice: Gods Among Us {{comic book}} series was {{announced}} by Ed Boon on October 5, 2012, during the EB Games Expo. The series {{serves as a}} prequel detailing the {{events leading up to}} the game, as well as those <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> in the interregnum between Superman's murder of the Joker and the discovery of the primary universe. The series was first written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by a number of artists, including Jheremy Raapack, Mike S. Miller, Bruno Redondo, Tom Derenick, and others. The comic was released digitally beginning on January 15, 2013. The series was later issued in regular comic book form, and eventually a collected edition. In December 2014, Tom Taylor announced that he would be leaving the series and left after writing Injustice: Year Three #14, with Brian Buccellato replacing him by continuing the story into Year Four and Five. The final chapter of the series was released in September 2016, leaving the story incomplete; another comic book series, titled Injustice: Ground Zero, followed afterwards, which picked up the story and concluded the retelling of the game's events from Harley Quinn's perspective.|$|E

5|$|Title reigns are {{determined}} either by professional wrestling matches between wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines, or by scripted circumstances. Wrestlers {{are portrayed as}} either villains or heroes as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches for the championship. Title changes <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> on episodes of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, air on television two to nine days from the date the match was taped. Changes that happened on weekly PPV events aired either during a live broadcast or aired on taped delay up to seven days apart. The inaugural champion was A.J. Styles, who defeated Low Ki, Jerry Lynn, and Psicosis in a Four Way Double Elimination match on June 19, 2002 at the taping of TNA's second weekly PPV event, which aired on June 26, 2002. Chris Sabin currently holds {{the record for the}} most reigns, with eight. At 301 days, Austin Aries' first reign is the longest in the title's history.
