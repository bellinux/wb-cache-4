As a result, the YC-123D had a greatly reduced takeoff and landing distance. Compared to the C-123B, the YC-123D could land in 755feet instead of 1,200, and takeoff with only 850ft of runway instead of 1,950, with a 50,000lb total weight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Turbo</b> <b>compounding</b> {{is one of}} {{the ways}} to recover wasted energy in the exhaust. This paper {{presents}} the effectiveness of series and parallel <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding</b> on a turbocharged diesel engine. A power turbine is coupled to the exhaust manifold, either in series or in parallel with the turbocharger, to recover waste heat energy. The effectiveness and working range of both configurations are presented in this paper. The engine in the current study is a 6 cylinder, 13 L diesel engine. Both the configurations were modeled with one dimensional simulation software. The current study found that series and parallel <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding</b> could improve average brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 1. 9 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. When the power turbine is mechanically connected to the engine, it could increase the average engine power by 1. 2 % for the series configuration and 2. 5 % for the parallel configuration...|$|R

Basically, {{this can be seen}} as a form of <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding.</b>|$|R
50|$|More recently, turbo-compounding {{has been}} applied to {{internal}} combustion engines. <b>Turbo</b> <b>compound</b> engines were extensively used as aircraft engines immediately after the Second World War.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Turbo</b> <b>Compound</b> {{systems have}} been used for piston {{aircraft}} engines since the late 1950s, until superseded by turboprop and turbojet engines (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocompound_engine). In the 1980s the mechanical <b>turbo</b> <b>compound</b> was applied in motorsport racing cars and in the 1990s in heavy truck diesel engines. In 2001, Caterpillar launched a program to develop an Electric Assisted Turbocharger (EAT) for truck applications [...]  In 2004, the first ETC prototype was created for the heavy truck industry by Bowman Power Ltd in partnership with John Deere.|$|E

5000|$|The ETC {{system is}} {{typically}} located downstream of the turbocharger of an ICE. The exhaust gases expand first through the turbocharger turbine {{and then through}} the ETC turbine driving a high speed generator. The high speed generator produces high frequency power that is converted to either DC or AC power.

40|$|After {{years of}} study and improvement, turbochargers in {{passenger}} cars now generally have very high efficiency. This is advantageous, {{but on the other}} hand, due to their high efficiency, {{only a small portion of}} the exhaust energy is needed for compressing the intake air, which means further utilization of waste heat is restricted. From this point of view, a turbo-compounding arrangement has significant advantage over a turbocharger in converting exhaust energy as it is immune to the upper power demand limit of the compressor. However, with the power turbine being located in series with the main turbine, power losses are incurred due to the higher back pressure which increases the pumping losses. This paper evaluates the effectiveness that the turbo-compounding arrangement has on a 2. 0 litres gasoline engine and seeks to draw a conclusion on whether the produced power is sufficient to offset the increased pumping work. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the baseline engine model in this paper is not a heavy-duty diesel engine which is more appropriate to the <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding</b> mechanism for automotive application, but a small size gasoline engine. This paper also aims to explore a potential methodology for extending the operating range of the <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding</b> in light-duty petrol engine over its entire speed range under full load condition. The system models in this paper were built in GT-Power which is a one dimension (1 -D) engine simulation code. Simulation results show that with the assistance of a variably driven supercharger, the output torque of the engine system is much larger (up to around 24 %) at lower engine speeds. The fuel economy is also improved by up to about 8 %...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was completely}} redesigned by Canadair, {{going from the}} pressure cabin of the Britannia to an unpressurised one with bomb bays fore and aft of the wings. The powerplant was also changed from the Bristol Proteus turboprop engines to Wright R-3350 compound (piston) engines, which had lower fuel consumption necessary for extended missions at low level. At the design stage the other possible engine was the Napier Nomad, another <b>turbo</b> <b>compound</b> engine, although the Nomad was later cancelled.|$|E
50|$|However, if a <b>turbo</b> <b>compound</b> {{engine is}} also {{supercharged}} by feeding {{some of the}} shaft power back to the supercharger, as in some aircraft engines, {{it is still a}} compound engine. Usage of the terms supercharged and turbosupercharged has varied with time, for example the makers of the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone compound engine described it at the time as turbosupercharged. It is however a compound engine, and a similar engine produced today would be described as supercharged rather than turbocharged.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the reported work were: to apply the stoichiometric compression ignition (SCI) concept to a 9. 0 liter diesel engine; to obtain engine-out NO{sub x} and PM exhaust emissions so that the engine can meet 2010 on-highway emission standards by applying a three-way catalyst for NO{sub x} control and a particulate filter for PM control; and to simulate an optimize the engine and air system to approach 50 % thermal efficiency using variable valve actuation and electric <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding.</b> The work demonstrated that an advanced diesel engine can be operated at stoichiometric conditions with reasonable particulate and NOx emissions at full power and peak torque conditions; calculated that the SCI engine will operate at 42 % brake thermal efficiency without advanced hardware, turbocompounding, or waste heat recovery; and determined that EGR is not necessary for this advanced concept engine, and this greatly simplifies the concept...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{enormous}} energy demand and environmental concern {{the interest on}} the alternate fuels to the diesel engines has been increased. Among all the fuels alcohols have received a considerable attention because these are bio-based, renewable and are oxygenated. But due to its properties they require higher operating temperatures in the combustion chambers. Hence in the present work a ceramic coated insulated engine is developed by incorporating an air gap between piston skirt and crown {{for the study of}} alcohols performance and emission characteristics. The combustion efficiency depends on the mixture strength, piston material and turbulence in the chamber. So, in this work an attempt is made with brass piston and brass insert with nine and twelve grooves. Among all the pistons tested the brass insert with nine grooves is best in terms of engine performance and emissions. With the elevated temperatures the main problems faced are drop in volumetric efficiency and lubricating oil deterioration and can be avoided with <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding</b> system and new lubricants...|$|R
40|$|Exhaust gas heat {{utilization}} in {{the form}} of Thermal Energy Recovery (TER) has attracted a major interest due to its potentials with Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Recovering useful energy, for example {{in the form}} of electrical power from the engine exhaust waste heat could benefit {{in the form of}} direct fuel economy or increase in the available electric power for the auxillary systems. The methodology in this paper includes the assessment of each waste heat recovery technology based on the current research and development trends for automotive application. It also looked into the potential for energy recovery, performances of each technology and factors affecting its implementation. Finally, the work presents an Electric <b>Turbo</b> <b>Compounding</b> (ETC) simulation using a Ford Eco-Boost as a baseline engine modeled with the 1 -Dimensional AVL Boost software. A validated 1 -D engine model was used to investigate the impact on the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) at full load. This paper presents some reviews on the turbo-compounding method and also the modelling efforts and results of an electric turbo-compounding system. Modelling shows that the turbo-compounding setup can be more beneficial than turbo-charging alone...|$|R

The cooling system changes coincided with more advanced electronics for engine management system (EMS) with electronically controlled cooling fan which was now fully controlled by the Engine ECU (EECU) {{and as a result}} fuel consumption is also reduced.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{automotive}} industry {{has been involved in}} {{the development and implementation of}} CO 2 reducing concepts such as the engines downsizing, stop/start systems as well as more costly full hybrid solutions and, more recently, waste heat recovery technologies. These latter include ThermoElectric Generator (TEG), Rankine cycle and Electric <b>Turbo</b> <b>Compound</b> (ETC) that have been practically implemented on few heavy-duty application but have not been proved yet as effective and affordable solutions for the automotive industry. The paper deals with the analysis of opportunities and challenges of the Electric <b>Turbo</b> <b>Compound</b> for automotive light-duty engines. In the ETC concept the turbine-compressor shaft is connected to an electric machine, which can work either as generator or motor. In the former case the power can satisfy the vehicle electrical demand to drive the auxiliaries or stored in the batteries. In the latter case the electric motor can assist the turbine and speed up the compressor when requested. Potentially the ETC offers great opportunity for better performance and emissions control, nevertheless its management needs to be carefully set, being strongly dependent on transient operation. In the paper the benefits achievable by the electric <b>turbo</b> <b>compound</b> have been analyzed by a comprehensive powertrain model. The model considers in-cylinder processes by a steady-state approach and simulates the ETC dynamics, accounting for the mutual interactions of engine boosting, exhaust temperature and pressure, auxiliaries demand and motor/generator management. The simulations have been carried out against generic and standard driving conditions (i. e. EUDC, FTP) and several ETC management strategies, assuming as reference a small Diesel passenger car. The results evidence that significant improvement of fuel economy and CO 2 reduction can be achieved by suitable management of ETC operation, depending on engine speed and load and auxiliaries demand...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years, the {{emission}} and {{on board diagnostics}} legislations for heavy duty trucks are {{getting more and more}} strict. An accurate engine model that is possible to execute in the engine control system enables both better diagnosis and lowered emissions by better control strategies. The objective of this thesis is to extend an existing mean value diesel engine model, to include <b>turbo</b> <b>compound.</b> The model should be physical, accurate, modular and {{it should be possible to}} execute in real time. The calibration procedure should be systematic, with some degree of automatization. Four different <b>turbo</b> <b>compound</b> models have been evaluated and two models were selected for further evaluation by integration with the existing model. The extended model showed to be quite insensitive to small errors in the compound turbine speed and hence, the small difference in accuracy of the tested models did not affect the other output signals significantly. The extended models had better accuracy and could be executed with longer step length than the existing model, despite that more complexity were added to the model. For example, the mean error of the intake manifold pressure at mixed driving was approximately 3. 0 %, compared to 5. 8 % for the existing model. The reasons for the improvements are probably the good performance of the added submodels and the systematic and partly automatized calibration procedure including optimization...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Advanced Diesel Engine Component Development (ADECD) Program {{to develop and}} demonstrate critical technology needed to advance the heavy-duty low heat rejection engine concept. Major development activities reported are the design, analysis, and fabrication of monolithic ceramic components; vapor phase and solid film lubrication; electrohydraulic valve actuation; and high pressure common rail injection. An advanced single cylinder test bed was fabricated as a laboratory tool in studying these advanced technologies. This test bed simulates the reciprocator for a system having no cooling system, <b>turbo</b> <b>compounding,</b> Rankine bottoming cycle, common rail injection, and variable valve actuation to achieve fuel consumption of 160 g/kW-hr (. 26 lb/hp-hr). The advanced concepts were successfully integrated into the test engine. All ceramic components met their functional and reliability requirements. The firedeck, cast-in-place ports, valves, valve guides, piston cap, and piston ring were made from silicon nitride. Breakthroughs required to implement a 'ceramic' engine included the fabrication of air-gap cylinder heads, elimination of compression gaskets, machining of ceramic valve seats within the ceramic firedeck, fabrication of cast-in-place ceramic port liners, implementation of vapor phase lubrication, and elimination of the engine coolant system. Silicon nitride valves were successfully developed to meet several production abuse test requirements and incorporated into the test bed with a ceramic valve guide and solid film lubrication. The ADECD cylinder head features ceramic port shields to increase insulation and exhaust energy recovery. The combustion chamber includes a ceramic firedeck and piston cap. The tribological challenge posed by top ring reversal temperatures of 550 C was met {{through the development of}} vapor phase lubrication using tricresyl phosphate at the ring-liner interface. A solenoid-controlled, variable valve actuation system that eliminated the conventional camshaft was demonstrated on the test bed. High pressure fuel injection via a common rail system was also developed to reduce particulate emissions...|$|R
