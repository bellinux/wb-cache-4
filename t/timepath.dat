40|$|The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has {{published}} forecasts of the Australian economy {{since the late}} 1960 s. These forecasts (usually 12 to 18 months ahead) have been dominated by short-term macroeconomic factors. Compared with when the IAESR commenced its forecasting, there are now many forecasters who concentrate {{on the performance of}} the Australian economy over the short term. There is, however, a dearth of regular commentary which focuses on policy options for the medium to long term. This article is the first of many which will aim to fill this perceived gap. In so doing we shall adopt a wider concept of forecasting called futurology. In this approach, many constraints of traditional forecasting are relaxed. In particular, we allow responses by economic agents to policy changes. This will suggest plausible situations in which different outcomes are possible. Our purpose is not to suggest what the future will be, but what it might be under different scenarios. Here, we put together some necessary ingredients to facilitate futurology. We review recent Australian economic performance, consider the implications of meeting a goal of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000 and outline some important influences on likely future growth. We suggest that new growth theory may provide a policy framework to achieve both high growth and low unemployment, noting the constraints imposed by increasing globalisation. In subsequent articles, we shall employ these ingredients to write out plausible <b>timepaths</b> setting out how desirable end-points (including the reduction of unemployment) may be achieved.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the fourth in a series which has {{described}} the role and construction of simulation models and a ‘Management Flight Simulator’ that could aid the entrepreneur-owners of so-called ‘dwarf’ or ‘stunted growth’ small firms to break out from the constraints holding them back. While the research presented to date has highlighted the issues in such companies, and has suggested that in many situations relatively simple changes only might be needed to unleash the growth potential of such firms, effecting such changes {{is not likely to}} be that “simple” in real life. It has to be possible for affected owner-entrepreneurs to understand a number of factors: that there is a problem (or opportunity), that there are real constraints on growth and how they have arisen, that simple changes might offer solutions, and that real benefits might ensue. This paper describes first field trials with the simulator. It describes interviews and trials with small firm owner-entrepreneurs to confirm that the simulator concept is generally acceptable, and that the simulations are life-like enough for entrepreneurs to be influenced by its outcomes. Early results suggest that the simulator does give a realistic picture of the possible transition between a presently constricted firm and one able to fulfil its growth potential. In this role it aids understanding of the reasons for business dwarfism and the kinds of change owner-entrepreneurs might have to make, and presents enlightening outlooks with the possible <b>timepaths,</b> or trajectories, of key performance measures. By demonstrating that growth objectives might be feasible, the simulator should stimulate and encourage an owner-manager, perhaps alongside other family/company stakeholders, to take a more detailed look at the practical options in their own firm’s case...|$|R

We take into account initial correlations up to the 4 -point functions. The model is shown to exhibit a SO(1, 1) symmetry broken by interactions and initial conditions. The divergence of the corresponding Noethercurrent is calculated and the Ward-Takahashi relations for the broken symmetry are given. They constitute a set of generalized integrated kinetic equations for the general n-point functions. We demonstrate that energy-momentum conservation follows from the transport equations. As an application we discuss inhomogeneities and general non-equilibrium conditions in the free field model. In our solution we identify the casimir-effect.

40|$|Reproductive health surveys often face {{difficulties}} in measuring age and durations. Heaping is the phenomenon that certain dates, ages or durations are over- or underrepresented. Following the calendar method used in several Demographic and Health Surveys, {{the current research}} proposes {{the use of a}} local <b>timepath</b> calendar, based on time perceptions of women in South India. The objective of the calendar is to reduce heaping in the durations of postpartum amenorrhoea, breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, and contraceptive use. The interviewer takes the respondent back in time using the local calendar; the memory of respondents is triggered by relating events to Indian festivals and other landmarks in the lives of people, enabling them to reply in their own time perspective. The method was tested in 2000 in a survey in South India; the findings indicate significantly less duration heaping...|$|E
