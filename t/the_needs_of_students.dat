5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> with smaller class sizes, staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, more predictable environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism {{events such as the}} WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E

25|$|One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method. This is {{a method}} of {{education}} for young children that stresses {{the development of a}} child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, The Montessori Method, presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments to meet <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.|$|E
