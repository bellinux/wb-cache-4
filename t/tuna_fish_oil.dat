40|$|AbstractThe {{elemental}} composition of Brazilian canned <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> packed in <b>oil</b> and brine was determined using the particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) technique. Three different brands {{representative of the}} Brazilian market were evaluated. The metallic cans were analyzed as well. The {{results indicate that the}} canned tuna is homogeneous (average variability ∼ 5 %) inside the cans as far as elemental concentration is concerned. The data analysis reveals that the major elements present in <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> are Na, Cl, K, P and S with average concentration ranging from 800 to 2400 mg/kg, while Fe (14. 22 mg/kg) and Zn (4. 51 mg/kg) constitute trace elements. Significant variations in the elemental concentration of canned tuna across the brands were observed for most of the elements. For instance, significant higher concentrations of Mg, P, K and Zn were observed for brand P when compared to the other brands. Moreover, significant differences were observed between oil-packed and brine-packed tuna. In this case, higher elemental concentrations were obtained for oil-packed tuna. An increasing pattern in the concentration of Fe as a function of storage time was observed for two of the brands studied in this work. Finally, the results concerning the metallic cans identified two different types of cans, namely Fe-rich cans and Al-rich cans. In general, the results obtained in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements of canned tuna...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} was aimed {{to determine the}} effect of fish oil and L-carnitine supplementation in fermented yellow corn diets on the performance of quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). The experiment was used 160 quails aged 70 days that were divided into five treatments and four replications. Each replication consisted of eight female quails. The mean initial body weight was 156. 60 ± 9. 61 g with Coefficient of Variance (CV) of 6. 14 %. The in-vivo digestibility study was carried out on the last week using total collection method. Two quails were chosen randomly from each cage and placed into individual raised cages. Overall this experiment used 40 quails for nutrient digestibility study. The {{research was}} carried out using a completely randomized design. The experimental diets were P 0 = basal diet (ricebran, concentrates, yellow corn), P 1 = ricebran, concentrate and fermented yellow corn, P 2 = P 1 feed+ 10 ppm of L-carnitine, P 3 = P 2 feed + 4 % of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil,</b> and P 4 = P 2 feed + 4 % of lemuru fish oil. The observed variables were dry matter digestibility, organic matter digestibility, extract ether digestibility, feed consumption, HDP, egg weight and feed conversion ratio. The results of variance analysis showed that substitution of yellow corn with fermented yellow corn increased dry matter digestibility, organic matter digestibility, extract ether digestibility, feed intake and egg weight, whereas the addition of L-carnitine in the diet of fermented yellow corn increased the value of the HDP and improved feed conversion.  Substitution of yellow corn with fermented yellow corn in the feed increased dry matter digestibility, organic matter digestibility, extract ether digestibility, egg weight, whereas the addition of L-carnitine 10  ppm in the feed of fermented yellow corn improved the HDP.

40|$|Dietary {{vegetable}} oils and fish oils rich in PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) exert hypocholesterolaemic and hypotriglyceridaemic effects in rodents. The plasma cholesterol-lowering properties of PUFA are due partly to a diminution of cholesterol synthesis {{and of the}} activity of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase). To better understand the mechanisms involved, we examined how <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> and individual n− 3 and n− 6 PUFA affect the expression of hepatic FPP synthase (farnesyl diphosphate synthase), a SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) target enzyme that is subject to negative-feedback regulation by sterols, in co-ordination with HMG-CoA reductase. Feeding mice on a <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> diet for 2  weeks decreased serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels, by 50 % and 60 % respectively. Hepatic levels of FPP synthase and HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs were also decreased, by 70 % and 40 % respectively. Individual n− 3 and n− 6 PUFA lowered FPP synthase and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels in H 4 IIEC 3 rat hepatoma cells {{to a greater extent than}} did stearate and oleate, with the largest inhibitory effects occurring with arachidonate, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). We observed a similar inhibitory effect on protein levels of FPP synthase. The suppressive effect of PUFA on the FPP synthase mRNA level was not due to a decrease in mRNA stability, but to transcription inhibition. Moreover, a lower nuclear availability of both SREBP- 1 and SREBP- 2 mature forms was observed in HepG 2 human hepatoblastoma cells treated with arachidonate, EPA or DHA. Taken together, these data suggest that PUFA can down-regulate hepatic cholesterol synthesis through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and FPP synthase, at least in part through impairment of the SREBP pathway...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is an infective disease caused {{predominantly}} by gram-negative anerobes. The host {{inflammatory response}} to these bacteria causes alveolar bone loss, which characterizes periodontitis. Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have recognized anti-inflammatory effects; their oxygenated derivatives are key mediators in reducing inflammation. In this study we tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> rich in the n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, would reduce alveolar bone loss in mice inoculated with periodontopathic bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult mice were fed experimental diets containing either 10 % tuna oil or Sunola oil for 57 d. After 14 d, 35 mice on each diet were inoculated orally with Porphyromonas gingivalis, {{with a mixture of}} P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with carboxymethylcellulose or remained untreated. The mice were killed, and soft tissue biopsies from the oral cavity of treated mice were used to determine the polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. The maxilla was removed, stained and digitally imaged to assess bone loss around the upper molars. RESULTS: n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were significantly higher in oral soft tissues of mice fed tuna oil compared with the control group. Mice fed tuna oil and inoculated with P. gingivalis or with the combination of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis exhibited 72 % and 54 % less alveolar bone loss respectively, compared with the treatment control group. CONCLUSION: Alveolar bone loss was inversely related to n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid tissue levels. In conclusion, fish oil dietary supplementation may have potential benefits as a host modulatory agent in the prevention and/or adjunctive management of periodontitis. A. Bendyk, V. Marino, P. S.

Exercise {{has been shown to}} improve heart rate variability (HRV), a predictor of cardiac death, but whether fish oil benefits HRV is controversial. Obese adults at risk of future coronary disease have impaired HRV and may benefit from these interventions. We evaluated the effect of DHA-rich <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> supplementation with and without regular exercise on HRV in sedentary, overweight adults with risk factors for coronary disease. In a randomised, double-blind, parallel comparison, sixty-five volunteers consumed 6 g fish oil/d (DHA 1 · 56 g/d, EPA 0 · 36 g/d) or sunflower-seed oil (placebo) for 12 weeks. Half of each oil group also undertook regular moderate physical activity (3 d/week for 45 min, at 75 % of age-predicted maximal heart rate (HR)). Resting HR and the HR response to submaximal exercise were measured at weeks 0, 6 and 12. In forty-six subjects, HRV was also assessed by power spectrum analysis of 20 min electrocardiogram recordings taken supine at baseline and 12 weeks. Fish oil supplementation improved HRV by increasing high-frequency power, representing parasympathetic activity, compared with placebo (P = 0 · 01; oil x time interaction). It also reduced HR at rest and during submaximal exercise (P = 0 · 008; oil x time interaction). There were no significant fish oil x exercise interactions. Dietary supplementation with DHA-rich fish oil reduced HR and modulated HRV in keeping with an improved parasympathetic–sympathetic balance in overweight adults with risk factors for future coronary disease.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comIntroduction: Dietary fish oil is thought to reduce sudden cardiac death by suppressing ventricular arrhythmias but {{little is known about}} its impact on atrial arrhythmias. We examined the effect of dietary fish oil on the rabbit model of stretch-induced vulnerability to atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and Results: Six-week-old rabbits were fed standard rabbit pellets supplemented with 5 % <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> (n = 6) or supplemented with 5 % sunflower oil (n = 6) for 12 weeks. Six rabbits raised on the standard diet were used as controls. In Langendorff-perfused hearts intraatrial pressures were increased in a stepwise manner and rapid burst pacing applied to induce AF at increasing intraatrial pressures until AF was sustained (> 1 minute). Atrial refractory periods were recorded at each pressure. Increased atrial pressure resulted in a reduction in atrial refractory period and a propensity for induction of sustained AF. Higher pressures were needed to induce and sustain AF in the fish oil group compared with the sunflower oil and control groups. The stretch-induced drop in refractory period was also less marked in the fish oil group. Red blood cell, atrial, and ventricular omega- 3 fatty acid levels were significantly higher in the fish oil group. The ratio of atrial n- 6 /n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was 13 ± 0. 9 with sunflower oil and 1. 5 ± 0. 01 with fish oil (P < 0. 001).

A total of 376 children (61. 0 % of total recruited) completed an assessment at 18 months and had blood taken to determine plasma fatty acid concentrations. Omega- 3 fatty acid levels were expressed in quintiles of exposure ‘as treated’ without reference to treatment group allocation. Wheeze ever, doctor visits for wheeze, bronchodilator use and nocturnal coughing were significantly reduced in children in the higher exposure quintiles. Serum IgE was reduced in the highest quintile but not significantly so. There was no difference in diagnosed asthma or atopy between the exposure quintiles.

RESULTS: Two systematic reviews and 11 trials {{were included in the}} clinical effectiveness review; however, the quality of reporting and methodology of the included studies was generally poor. No economic evaluations were identified. No statistically significant difference in remission rates was found between cyclophosphamide plus prednisone and prednisone alone for all children or those with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), also the time to response was statistically significantly less with cyclophosphamide (38. 4 days versus 95. 5 days). Remission rates were not statistically significantly different between intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide. Vomiting was common with intravenous cyclophosphamide, while pneumonia and alopecia occurred in the oral group. Ciclosporin statistically significantly increased the number of children with complete remission compared with placebo or supportive treatment, but not for the FSGS subgroup, adverse effects including infection and hypertension differed little between groups. No differences were found between azathioprine and placebo, with about 13 % of each group having remission. Complete or partial remission occurred in six out of seven patients on the 18 -month methylprednisolone regimen and three out of five patients on the 6 -month regimen, for both groups renal function improved and adverse events such as hypertension and frequent infections occurred. Intravenous dexamethasone and methylprednisolone produced similar complete remission rates, partial remission rates, median time to response (about 10 days) and total number of adverse events, with hypertension as the most common. Six-hour urinary albumin and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio decreased statistically significantly with high-dose but not low-dose enalapril. <b>Tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> was not associated with any statistically significant improvements in proteinuria, creatinine clearance, serum creatinine or lipid profiles compared with placebo. A very limited literature was found on costs associated with SRNS in children. The pharmaceutical cost of treatment varied considerably: an 8 -week course of cyclophosphamide cost less than 6 pounds, while a course of ciclosporin cost almost 900 pounds per year. Treatment with tacrolimus, an alternative to ciclosporin, was estimated to cost in excess of 3400 pounds per year. Healthcare medical management costs were estimated; varying by treatment strategy, they ranged from 250 pounds to 930 pounds per year in patients not experiencing complications. Other longer term costs may also be incurred. Lack of data meant that cost-effectiveness modelling was not feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical effectiveness literature on treatments for idiopathic SRNS in children is very limited. The available evidence suggests a beneficial effect of ciclosporin on remission rates and of cyclophosphamide on time to remission; however, the strength of the conclusions drawn is limited by the poor quality of the included studies. The other treatments included in this review were each evaluated by only one study, and none found a statistically significant effect. There is insufficient evidence {{to determine whether or not}} there is a clinically significant difference. The available data on costs and outcomes are sparse and do not permit the reliable modelling of the cost-effectiveness of treatments for SRNS at present. A modelling framework is suggested, should more relevant data become available. A well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trial comparing ciclosporin with other treatments in children with SRNS without genetic mutation is required...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that omega- 3 (n- 3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (found in fish oil) have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system including a reduction in ischaemia induced cardiac arrhythmia and increased threshold required to induce electrically ventricular fibrillation. In heart, membrane phospholipid composition reflects dietary fat content. In particular regular fish consumption in humans {{has been shown to}} reduce the incidence of new heart attacks, while in rats n- 3 PUFA is associated with improved oxygen efficiency and maintained function. In skeletal muscle, membrane composition also reflects dietary fat content. Increased dietary n- 3 PUFA has significant effects on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and substrate preference amongst a number of other functional changes. The direct effects of n- 3 PUFA on skeletal muscle oxygen consumption has not been investigated and may have a significant role in maintaining contractile performance and reducing fatigue. The aim of this thesis was to study the possible direct effects of dietary n- 3 PUFA on skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and function in rats. Male Wistar rats (12 weeks old) were fed, ad lib, one of three diets (SF: saturated fat; n- 6 PUFA: safflower oil; n- 3 PUFA: <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil)</b> for a period of 8 weeks. The total fat content of the diets was 10 % by weight and the level of polyunsaturation in the n- 6 and n- 3 groups was controlled using a mixture of the test oil and monounsaturated olive oil. After 8 weeks, skeletal muscle oxygen consumption, function and fatigue were assessed using the rat auto-perfused contracting hindlimb developed in this thesis and membrane fatty acids were analysed. The hindlimb auto-perfusion enabled control of blood flow to the animals hindlimb in resting and contracting conditions with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and skeletal muscle twitch tension. The auto-perfusion achieved close to physiologically relevant oxygen consumption and perfusion pressure with a hindlimb flow rate that was reflective of in vivo conditions compared to previously used rat hindlimb perfusion systems. The skeletal muscle membrane composition was reflective of the fat content in the diets. Animals fed n- 3 PUFA compared to SF and n- 6 PUFA significantly increased total n- 3 PUFA, mostly through increased levels of the long chain fat docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the membranes. This significantly altered the n- 3 /n- 6 ratio in the membranes. The change in membrane fatty acid composition was very close to previously established changes in the heart after similar dietary interventions, particularly DHA content. The collective results of this thesis support the role of the long chain n- 3 PUFA DHA in membranes, as a requirement for optimal skeletal muscle function. In the rat auto-perfused contracting hindlimb, during brief (10 minutes) and prolonged (30 minutes) bouts of stimulation, in recovery after bouts of stimulation and during hypoxic conditions, n- 3 PUFA feeding was associated with enhanced muscle contractile function and indicative of reduced fatigue. Specifically, reduced fatigue in the n- 3 PUFA group during normoxic conditions was associated with maintenance of isometric twitch rise time, fall time, contraction duration and maximum rate of tension development and relaxation. The effect of diet on these twitch characteristics provide information that may explain the measured differences in fatigue, such as sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. Supportive of the possible changes in skeletal muscle calcium handling was the greater recovery of tension from the fatigued state in n- 3 PUFA animals when caffeine was administered. Of particular interest in regard to the hypothesis of this thesis, reduced fatigue in the n- 3 PUFA group was associated with modulated oxygen consumption during contraction and recovery. These results complement earlier findings in heart and establish n- 3 PUFA DHA in skeletal muscle as an essential membrane fatty acid for optimal function. If human applications of these results are successful, it is most likely that dietary n- 3 PUFA may have significant impact on dysfunctional skeletal muscle and improve quality of life. This encompasses muscle function in combination with sedentary life style, diabetes, heart failure, or muscular dystrophy...|$|E
