25|$|An {{article in}} <b>the</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standard,</b> an American {{conservative}} opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, all {{costs associated with}} building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training. For houses constructed by foreign volunteers, travel and associated costs paid by the volunteers are also significant. Including these costs raises the question whether building a house this way is an efficient use of resources. Particularly in developing countries where labor is relatively inexpensive, unemployment is high, and local currency is cheap, purchasing local labor and supplies may result {{in an increase in}} the number of houses built.|$|E

500|$|Although Daniels {{had claimed}} to be {{reluctant}} to seek higher office, many media outlets, including Politico, <b>The</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standard,</b> Forbes, The Washington Post, CNN, The Economist, and The Indianapolis Star began to speculate that Daniels may intend to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in The Wall Street Journal to policies espoused by the Democratic-majority Congress and the White House in August 2010. The speculation has included Daniels' record of reforming government, reducing taxes, balancing the budget, and connecting with voters in Indiana. Despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement, regulated abortion, and a defense of marriage act, he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a [...] "truce" [...] on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issues. His [...] "willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit" [...] has been another source of contention.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standard's</b> Bill Whalen, {{saw that}} with the ascent of Schwarzenegger, other celebrities were {{considering}} political careers (such as Republican Kelsey Grammer).

But the piece went on to note that other Republican celebrities had been able to make the transition to elected politician (Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan, Sonny Bono), because they [...] "embodied optimism". Miller, the Standard proclaimed, was seen in contrast as [...] "both terribly erudite...and decidedly yuppie (the comedian endorses DirecTV and Amstel Light, not his namesake brew). Not to mention a little too edgy for some Republicans." [...] The Standard noted that he had been booed by some in the Republican audience during his Los Angeles fund-raiser for President Bush when he said Democratic [...] "West Virginia senator Robert Byrd 'must be burning the cross at both ends'." [...] Miller had responded [...] "'Well, he was in the Klan. Boo me, but he was in the Klan.'" [...] The Standard said [...] "he'd be an HBO politician trying to play to a T.G.I. Friday's electorate." ...|$|R
