25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. <b>They</b> <b>wonder</b> what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E
500|$|The Prince of Egypt is an {{adaptation}} of the Biblical story of the Exodus. [...] "When You Believe" [...] is sung in the film by characters Tzipporah and Miriam, and a chorus of people departing from the slavery of Egypt to the Red Sea and the Promised Land. The protagonists of this ballad recall tough times that have caused them to question their own faith: they have prayed for many nights to God, but those prayers have seemed to remain unanswered, and now <b>they</b> <b>wonder</b> if their faith has been only a waste of time. Nevertheless, the main characters realize that although the times may be difficult, their faith should remain strong. As a bridge, a chorus of children sings excerpts of the Song of the Sea in Hebrew.|$|E
60|$|THERE {{was once}} a child, and he strolled about a good deal, and thought {{of a number of}} things. He had a sister, who was a child too, and his {{constant}} companion. These two used to wonder all day long. <b>They</b> <b>wondered</b> at the beauty of the flowers; <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> at the height and blueness of the sky; <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> at the depth of the bright water; <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> at the goodness and the power of GOD who made the lovely world.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Fosbrook soon {{knew what}} Mrs. Merrifield meant {{by saying that}} visits at the Park {{unsettled}} the children. Susan indeed, though liking anything that shortened lessons by an hour, and made a change, was not so fond of being on her good behaviour at the Park as to be greatly exalted at the prospect; but Elizabeth and Annie were changed beings. They were constantly breaking out with some new variety of <b>wonder.</b> <b>They</b> <b>wondered</b> whether <b>they</b> should dine in the school-room, or at Mrs. Greville's luncheon; <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if Mr. Greville would speak to them; <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> whether Fraulein Munsterthal would be cross; <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if Ida still played with dolls; and they {{looked as if they}} thought themselves wonderful, too, for going out for a day! ...|$|R

500|$|The next morning, {{the girls}} of the Bear Flag are exhausted; {{the members of}} the private party wore them out. <b>They</b> <b>wonder</b> how Suzy's date with Doc went. Although it is only July, Fauna is busy {{ordering}} the Bear Flag's Christmas cards ("The Happiest House on the Block"). Suzy comes in and tells Fauna of the date; that Doc made no pass at her, and that Doc confided how lonely he is. She is convinced Doc [...] "don't need nobody like me"; he needs a wife. Fauna is encouraging, but Suzy believes that Doc, knowing what he does of her history and work, will not want her. The Flophouse is to host a fancy dress party the following night, at which the raffle is to take place—Fauna proposes that at the party, Suzy sing [...] "Will You Marry Me?" [...] to Doc. Suzy is still nervous; Fauna reminds her that the previous night, Doc did not treat her like a tramp, and she did not act like one. As word spreads of the celebration, the community becomes enthusiastic about the get-together ("The Party That We're Gonna Have Tomorrow Night") ...|$|E
500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. <b>They</b> <b>wonder</b> if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel. She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E
500|$|Rhys' mother, Elaine (Sancia Robinson), was {{introduced}} in November 2011. Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain [...] "a lot more about why Rhys {{is the way he}} is". He added that there would be [...] "a big revelation" [...] about Elaine coming up. Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair. Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both. Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family, so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him, he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him. Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to wonder if he is ashamed to be seen with her. Rhys' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother's suspicions. While <b>they</b> <b>wonder</b> who Elaine is, he makes up an excuse. Barber explained [...] "Rhys pretends he's visiting one of his patients. Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he comes out with that. He realises, and feels terrible." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The French {{feel that}} the rapid and poorly {{distributed}} increase {{in the price of}} water leads to new social inequities. They find it hard to accept that the water tariff weighs essentially on urban users and that, in apartment buildings, it is included in the rent. They do not understand that agricultural production is exempt from the Polluter-pays principle and that it continues to deteriorate the quality of groundwater with impunity. <b>They</b> <b>wonder</b> about the lack of transparency that prevails in the provision of public water supply. Finally, they find it very hard to understand their water bills." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Terry Rakolta, from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, led {{a boycott}} of the show after viewing the episode [...] "Her Cups Runneth Over". Offended by the images {{of an old man}} wearing a woman's garter and stockings, the scene where Steve touches the pasties of a {{mannequin}} dressed in S gear, a homosexual man wearing a tiara on his head (and Al's line [...] "...and <b>they</b> <b>wonder</b> why we call them 'queens'"), and a half-nude woman who takes off her bra in front of Al (and is shown with her arms covering her bare chest in the next shot), Rakolta began a letter-writing campaign to advertisers, demanding they boycott the show.|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2016 {{interview}} with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, Media Watch host Paul Barry examined {{the question of}} perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because [...] "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and <b>they</b> <b>wonder</b> where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don't {{do that kind of}} journalism. We don't ask questions about our journalists' voting pattern and where their ideology are. We look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards..." [...] Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote [...] "How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?" [...] while former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes wrote for The Age that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.|$|E

2500|$|Ward {{envisioned a}} planet whose {{interior}} was both wooden and archaic in design, where Luddite-like monks would take refuge. The story {{begins with a}} monk who sees a [...] "star in the East" [...] (Ripley's escape pod) and at first believes {{this to be a}} good omen. Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it {{to be some sort of}} religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, <b>they</b> <b>wonder</b> if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer reality of what she has brought with her, the Monks of the [...] "wooden satellite" [...] lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on the true nature of the beast. The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley's own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternate ending where the character survived, but eventually Sigourney Weaver said she would only do the movie if Ripley died.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{the child}} Isabella and Paul had, Ricky Williams was re-introduced {{to the series}} as an adult, now portrayed by Pete Porte. The role had been {{dramatically}} rapidly aged over the duration of 8 years to an adult. Adam Hughes of Yahoo! stated that bringing the character back would work well, he wrote: [...] "Regardless of his initial motivation for heading back to Wisconsin, Ricky will undoubtedly open up many old wounds and many new story line possibilities. Will he angrily confront Paul? Will Isabella manage to return home, as well, to see her big boy?" [...] Doug Davidson stated that Paul harbored possible guilt in regards to Ricky's upbringing, having been raised by his grandparents. Lauralee Bell spoke about the love triangle between Paul, Christine and Isabella {{and what kind of}} twists would occur through Ricky returning. She said: [...] "That whole Isabella thing was a very scary time for Chris and Paul and now <b>they</b> <b>wonder</b> if there's something off about Ricky. At first, no one knew Isabella was crazy. He could be a whack job like his mother. Time will tell. But seeing Ricky {{for the first time as}} a man is really startling for Chris. And for me, too." [...] Ultimately, Ricky turned out to be psychotic like his mother and was killed by his own father Paul to prevent him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap).|$|E
