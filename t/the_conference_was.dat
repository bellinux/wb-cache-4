5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started {{to believe in the}} merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> cut short, however, {{when news}} reached Licinius that his rival Maximinus {{had crossed the}} Bosporus and invaded European territory. Licinius {{departed}} and eventually defeated Maximinus, gaining control over the entire {{eastern half of the}} Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt {{at the hands of a}} character that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar; Licinius, for his part, had Constantine's statues in Emona destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A major talking {{point at}} <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford {{shortly before the}} conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E

5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E
5|$|At this conference, {{which was}} {{organised}} by Britain with American support, Van der Byl {{rejected the idea}} of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified {{as one of the few}} ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement. <b>The</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> adjourned by the British foreign minister, Anthony Crosland, on 14 December 1976, and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion. Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{entered the}} 2001 college {{football}} season after a 132 loss to Oklahoma {{in the national}} championship game.

Florida State, which had a 702 record in Atlantic Coast Conference games since joining <b>the</b> <b>conference,</b> <b>was</b> again favored to win the ACC, but the Seminoles faced challenges replacing Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Chris Weinke and 14 other starters from the previous year's team.

5|$|Historically, the Hokies {{have had}} limited success. From 1892 to 1921, Tech competed as a {{football}} independent. The Hokies won several games against larger, better-funded teams during this time, but did not compete in many games outside the American South. From 1921 to 1964, Tech {{was a member of}} the Southern Conference and won the conference championship in 1963. The membership of the Southern Conference fluctuated wildly at times during Tech's tenure. When <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> created in 1921, it boasted 23 teams. This number was reduced when the Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference split away in 1932 and 1953, respectively. By the time Tech won the conference championship in 1963, the conference's membership had shrunk to less than 10 teams. Tech administrators, wanting to expand the football program, chose to leave the conference and become a football independent once more.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. <b>The</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E

5|$|Quwatli's early {{involvement}} in the Arab nationalist movement came through the Arab Congress of 1913. Shortly after starting his career at the Ottoman civil service in Damascus, he received an invitation to attend the conference in Paris. However, <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> strongly condemned by the Ottoman authorities, and Arab notables were forbidden from attending. Nevertheless, the congress had succeeded in rousing nationalist feelings in Arab provinces. Quwatli's first confrontation with the Ottoman authorities came in February 1914 during a visit by Jamal Pasha, the governor of Syria at the time, to {{the offices of the}} Governorate of Damascus, where Quwatli worked. During the visit, Quwatli refused to follow the normal protocol—bending over and kissing Jamal Pasha's right hand—and was promptly thrown in prison at the Citadel of Damascus. He was bailed out of prison a few days later through his family's connections, but he lost his job at the civil service.|$|E
5|$|The International's {{rationale}} was {{to construct}} new mass revolutionary parties able to lead successful workers' revolutions. It saw these arising from a revolutionary wave which would develop alongside {{and as a}} result of the coming World War. Thirty delegates attended a founding conference, held in September 1938, in the home of Alfred Rosmer just outside Paris. Present at the meeting were delegates from all the major countries of Europe, and from North America, although for reasons of cost and distance, few delegates attended from Asia or Latin America. An International Secretariat was established, with many of the day's leading Trotskyists and most countries in which Trotskyists were active represented. Among the resolutions adopted by <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> the Transitional Programme.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{government}} prevented Du Bois {{from attending}} the 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia. <b>The</b> <b>conference</b> <b>was</b> {{the culmination of}} 40 years of Du Bois's dreams– a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world's colored peoples. The conference celebrated their independence, as the nations began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War. In 1958, Du Bois regained his passport, and with his second wife, Shirley Graham Du Bois, he traveled around the world, visiting Russia and China. In both countries he was celebrated and given guided tours of the best aspects of communism. Du Bois later wrote approvingly of the conditions in both countries. He was 90 years old.|$|E
