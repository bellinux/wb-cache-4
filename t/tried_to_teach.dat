5|$|News {{of their}} {{engagement}} appeared in The Times and The Daily Telegraph newspapers on 14October 1963, {{and the two}} were married at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton on 20November. After a ceremony attended by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (one of whose ladies-in-waiting had been a relative of Lady Lucan), but by few other prominent members of high society, the couple honeymooned in Europe, travelling first class on the Orient Express. Lucan's already embattled finances were given a welcome boost by his father, who provided him with a marriage settlement designed to finance a larger family home and any future additions to the Lucan family. Lucan repaid some of his creditors and purchased 46Lower Belgrave Street, Belgravia, redecorating it to suit Veronica's tastes. Two months after the wedding, on 21January 1964, the 6thEarl of Lucan died of a stroke. In addition to a reputed £250,000 inheritance, Lucan acquired his father's titles: Earl of Lucan; Baron Lucan of Castlebar; Baron Lucan of Melcombe Lucan and Baronet Bingham of Castlebar. His wife became the Countess of Lucan. Their first child, Frances, was born on 24October 1964, and early the next year they employed a nanny, Lillian Jenkins, to look after her. Lucan <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Veronica about gambling and traditional pursuits like hunting, shooting, and fishing. He bought her golf lessons; she later gave up the sport.|$|E

Their aunt <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the girls {{how to run a}} household, but their minds were more inclined to literature. Their father's well-stocked library was a source of knowledge. They read the Bible, Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Scott, and many others, they examined articles from Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Fraser's Magazine, and The Edinburgh Review and read history, geography and biographies.|$|E

25|$|All {{the sites}} of Ashokan {{inscription}} were chosen carefully {{to ensure that they}} were accessible to large numbers of people. These edicts are proclamations to the public at large. They explain the idea of Dhamma. One must make a distinction between Ashoka's policy of Dhamma which stressed social responsibility and Ashoka's own commitment as a Buddhist. There has been a tendency in the past among historians to study the policy of Dhamma and Ashoka as Buddhist in the same context without making any distinction. An examination of the inscriptions suggests that Ashoka declared his personal association with a Buddhist order and on the other he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach,</b> through the policy of Dhamma, the importance of social responsibility and tolerance amongst different members of the society.|$|E

Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong {{relationship}} of mutual respect and friendship, {{living on the}} same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. [...] "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers, with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Pound to box, but as he told Sherwood Anderson, [...] " [...] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".|$|E
500|$|In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, {{starting}} {{a period where}} natural sciences were esteemed. Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various {{places in the world}} to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his [...] "apostles". His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.|$|E

500|$|Mau {{first visited}} Hawaii in 1973, and McCoy {{introduced}} him to Ben Finney. Later, Finney suggested to the Polynesian Voyaging Society that they should try to recruit Mau for their Hōkūle‘a project, since no Hawaiian traditional navigators remained. The project goal was {{to test the hypothesis}} that Polynesians made intentional non-instrument voyages across the Pacific. Tevake, a renowned Polynesian navigator, had died in 1970 and only six others were known. Navigators were reluctant to release their sacred knowledge to [...] "outsiders". At the time, Mau was just 41 years old and the youngest navigator out of the group. Mau feared that traditional navigation would die in his own culture, just as it had in Hawaii. He had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the young men of Satawal the skills passed on to him, but he was not optimistic. The members of the younger generation were too busy with school and too attracted to Western culture to undertake the rigorous course of study and apprenticeship. Further, Mau's people did not seem to care that traditional navigation was dying and could be lost forever.|$|E
500|$|Dalton {{was born}} in Coosa County, Alabama to Eliza Foscue and John Percival Lee. Her parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Texas in 1849, and they made the trek to Utah Territory shortly after their conversion. In 1851, Dalton's family moved to the San Bernardino Valley in California {{as part of a}} Mormon {{expedition}} led by Amasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich. Seven years later her family moved to Beaver, Utah. Despite her family's poverty, Dalton's parents <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> her at home and let her attend school as long as possible. [...] There were many children in her family, and at the time, many teenage girls stayed home to help with childcare and housework, but Dalton's family encouraged her to go to school. Since her family moved between rural areas, her education was scattered and not very methodical. Her teacher in Utah tutored her during lunch and after school and started training her to be a teacher herself. At age 12, her father founded a private school where Dalton helped teach. At age 16, Dalton became a teacher herself for an [...] "infant school." ...|$|E

Stalin was a day student at the seminary and helped Ter-Petrosian prepare to enter the seminary. Stalin was expelled from the seminary in 1899; followed by Kamo, who was expelled in 1901. Kamo rejoined Stalin, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> him Marxism and better Russian [...] but gave up in despair.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to signing Genie would pantomime some words as she spoke, for instance crouching into a seated position when saying the words [...] "sit" [...] or [...] "sick", and act out sequences of events. Unlike young children, for who this is ancillary to their speech and lessens as they acquire more language, Genie maintained {{this as an}} integral part of her vocabulary. At first Genie only drew pictures if specifically asked, but later began to draw pictures or use images from magazines or books to relate to daily experiences or if she could not express herself in words. Until 1973 Curtiss and Fromkin unsuccessfully <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Genie to read and write, although other people made subsequent attempts; by the time Curtiss presented her dissertation Genie had learned to read approximately five to ten unspecified names and words, and could write individual letters in print.|$|E
2500|$|His famous {{textbook}} Sekai Kunizukushi ("All the Countries of the World, for Children Written in Verse", 1869) {{became a}} best seller and {{was used as an}} official school textbook. [...] His inspiration for writing the books came when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> world geography to his sons. [...] At the time there were no textbooks on the subject, so he decided to write one himself. [...] He started by buying a few Japanese geography books for children, named Miyakoji ("City roads") and Edo hōgaku ("Tokyo maps"), and practiced reading them aloud. He then wrote Sekai Kunizukushi in six volumes in the same lyrical style. [...] The first volume covered Asian countries, the second volume detailed African countries, European countries were discussed in the third, South American countries in the fourth, and North American countries and Australia in the fifth. Finally, the sixth volume was an appendix that gave an introduction to world [...] geography.|$|E

In 1910–1913 Matyushin and his wife Elena Guro (1877–1913) were {{key members of the}} Union of the Youth, an {{association}} of Russian Futurists. Matyushin, a professional musician and amateur painter, studied physiology of human senses and developed his own concept of the fourth dimension connecting visual and musical arts, a theory that he put to practice in the classrooms of Leningrad Workshop of Vkhutein and INHUK (1918–1934) and summarized in his 1932 Reference of Colour (Cправочник по цвету).Matyushin conducted experiments at his Visiology Center (Zorved) to demonstrate that expanding visual sensitivity from retinian optical centers would enable the discovery of [...] "new organic substance and rhythm in the apprehension of space." [...] He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself and his students to see with both eyes, each independently, and to widen the field of their vision.

2500|$|Slaves {{also learned}} about Christianity by {{attending}} services {{led by a}} white preacher or supervised by a white person. [...] Slaveholders often held prayer meetings at their plantations. In the South until the Great Awakening, most slaveholders were Anglican if they practiced any Christianity. Although {{in the early years}} of the first Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers argued for manumission of slaves and abolition, by the early decades of the 19th century, they often had found ways to support the institution. [...] In settings where whites supervised worship and prayer, they used Bible stories that reinforced people's keeping to their places in society, urging slaves to be loyal and to obey their masters. In the 19th century, Methodist and Baptist chapels were founded among many of the smaller communities and common planters. During the early decades of the 19th century, they used stories such as the Curse of Ham to justify slavery to themselves. They promoted the idea that loyal and hard-working slaves would be rewarded in the afterlife. Sometimes slaves established their own Sabbath schools to talk about the Scriptures. Slaves who were literate <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> others to read, as Frederick Douglass did while still enslaved as a young man in Maryland.|$|E

[...] Tabari further relates on {{the authority}} of Ismail al-Suddi that [...] "when Jesus was in his youth, his mother committed him [...] to study the Torah. While Jesus played with the youths of his village, he used {{to tell them what}} their parents were doing." [...] Sa'id ibn Jubayr, according to Tabari, is said to have reported that Jesus would say to one of his fellow playmates in the religious school, [...] "Your parents have kept such and such food for you, would you give me some of it?" [...] Jesus would usually tell his fellow pupils in the religious school what their parents ate and what they have kept for them when they return home. He used to say to one boy, [...] "Go home, for your parents have kept for you such and such food and they are now eating such and such food." ...|$|E
