5|$|In 1999, {{with his}} friend Daniel Barenboim, Said co-founded the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, based in Seville, which {{comprises}} young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. Besides being an academic, Said also was an accomplished pianist, and, with Barenboim, co-authored the book Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), a compilation of <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> about music. Edward Said died of leukemia on 25 September 2003.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, Olivia and Sam Weiss {{continue}} {{to meet at}} the bowling alley, where he subjects her to seemingly menial tasks like tying her shoes and keeping score during games. Although initially finding <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> useless, he cures Olivia's inability to walk without a cane {{by the end of}} the episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} was rewarding for Pei, {{and he agreed}} immediately {{to work with the}} group again. The new project was the Miho Museum, to display Koyama's collection of tea ceremony artifacts. Pei visited the site in Shiga Prefecture, and during <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300items showcasing the history of the Silk Road.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund {{began his}} {{studies at the}} University of Vienna in or shortly before 1470. He was made provost of the Budafelhévíz Chapter around the same time. He studied at the University of Ferrara between 1471 and 1473. One of his professors, Ludovico Carbone, {{published}} <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> about Matthias Corvinus as a literary dialogue. Ernuszt was famed for his erudition among the Renaissance humanist scholars who visited Hungary in the late 15th century.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayas speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano {{in daily}} life. Boholano-Bisaya is the dominantly used {{language}} among the languages spoken {{by the members}} of the Eskayan tribe. This variety is used in their close familial interactions, in <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> with their neighbors in the community, in their transactions in the barangay, school meetings, social gatherings, church rituals and in the trade and commerce. However, they are better known for an auxiliary language, known as Eskayan, or Ineskaya, which is used for prayers, songs, and formal speeches. Lexically, Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language (however, considered to be an encryption of Cebuano) although there is strong but inconsistent Spanish influence. A striking feature of the language is its unusual phonotactics.|$|E

60|$|So saying, {{he opened}} a door and entered the library. Without wishing to hear <b>their</b> <b>conversation,</b> Jeanie, as she was circumstanced, could not avoid it; for as Stubbs stood by the door, and his Reverence was at {{the upper end of}} a large room, <b>their</b> <b>conversation</b> was {{necessarily}} audible in the anteroom.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{had been}} {{listening}} to <b>their</b> <b>conversation</b> with undisguised interest.|$|R
25|$|Caragiale {{was also}} visited by Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, who, as a Francophile, vehemently {{rejected}} {{the aesthetics of}} Berlin in <b>their</b> <b>conversations.</b> Delavrancea was accompanied by his daughter, Cella, a celebrated pianist.|$|E
25|$|When the Turkish {{authorities}} {{gave the}} orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant {{to a whole}} race; they understood this well, and, in <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact.|$|E
25|$|Domestically, King Hui patronized {{philosophy}} and the arts, and {{is perhaps best}} remembered for hosting the Confucian philosopher Meng Zi at his court; <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> form the first two chapters of the book which bears Meng Zi's name.|$|E

60|$|That was all <b>their</b> <b>conversation</b> {{for three}} miles. Yet she was happy.|$|R
25|$|What {{happened}} next {{is a matter}} of dispute. Dobre insists that the two party functionaries were held hostage in the booth until Ceaușescu's arrival, given only water and monitored in <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> with Bucharest; other sources confirm this account. Verdeț dismissed this version as being merely a legend.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with this, Poporanist critic Garabet Ibrăileanu argued that Caragiale actually hated {{the people who}} inspired his works, and claimed that the writer had made this clear during one of <b>their</b> <b>conversations.</b> His account was considered doubtful by researcher Ştefan Cazimir, who believed that Ibrăileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work.|$|E
25|$|A {{language}} game (also called {{secret language}} or ludling or argot) {{is a system}} of manipulating spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. Language games are used primarily by groups attempting to conceal <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> from others. Some common examples are Pig Latin; the Gibberish family, prevalent in the United States and Sweden; and Verlan, spoken in France.|$|E

25|$|With Mosher {{the father}} of two {{children}} and Connelly six, the two had enough source material and inspiration for the show's dialogue and plot lines. Connelly's eight-year-old son, Ricky, served as the model for Beaver and his fourteen-year-old son, Jay, for Wally, while Eddie Haskell and Larry Mondello were based on friends of the Connelly boys. Connelly often took the boys on outings while carrying a notebook to record <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> and activities.|$|E
25|$|A {{production}} crew conducting research for Maxwell, an eponymous biographical film by the BBC, uncovered tapes {{stored in a}} suitcase owned by Maxwell's former head of security John Pole. Later in his life, Maxwell had become increasingly paranoid of his own employees and had the offices of those he suspected of disloyalty wired so he could hear <b>their</b> <b>conversations.</b> After Maxwell's death, the tapes remained in Pole's suitcase and were only discovered by the researchers in 2007.|$|E
25|$|May Kasahara: May is {{a teenage}} girl who should be in school, but, by choice, is not. Toru and May carry on a fairly {{constant}} exchange throughout {{a good deal of}} the novel; when May is not present, she writes letters to him. <b>Their</b> <b>conversations</b> in person are often bizarre and revolve around death and the deterioration of human life. Even more bizarre is the cheerful and decidedly non-serious air with which these conversations take place.|$|E
50|$|Through <b>their</b> <b>conversation,</b> Ira {{discovers that}} Abby {{lives with her}} parents who are musicians. She is a great believer in people's {{goodness}} and always wants to help others. At the end of <b>their</b> <b>conversation,</b> she proposes marriage to Ira, who is initially shocked. After a bit though, he agrees and the two consummate their engagement in her office.|$|R

25|$|Many creationists {{strongly}} oppose certain scientific {{theories in}} a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of bias within the scientific community, and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in modern science, creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on faith, creation science, or intelligent design. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by quote mining) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally pseudoscientific.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{who were}} thought to possess {{significant}} technical or strategic information were brought to specialist intelligence-gathering facilities at Fort Hunt, Virginia or Camp Tracy, California. After arriving in these camps, the prisoners were interrogated again, and <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> were wiretapped and analysed. Some of the conditions at Camp Tracy violated Geneva Convention requirements, such as insufficient exercise time being provided. However, prisoners at this camp were given special benefits, such as high quality food and access to a shop, and the interrogation sessions were relatively relaxed. The continuous wiretapping at both locations may have also violated {{the spirit of the}} Geneva Convention.|$|E
25|$|Jean Butler, {{who married}} shortly after {{authorities}} removed Genie {{from her house}} and began using her married name, Ruch, stayed in touch with Genie's mother. Although Genie's mother later recalled that most of <b>their</b> <b>conversations</b> during this time were shallow in nature, they continued to get along very well. Throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers, Ruch persistently accused researchers of conducting harmful tests, deliberately forcing her mother out of her life, and misusing the available grant money, all of which the research team consistently and emphatically denied. Genie's mother steadily began listening more to Ruch, and eventually came to feel the research team was marginalizing her.|$|E
