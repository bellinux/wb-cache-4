[...] Also, Michael Ledeen, an AEI scholar and Iran expert who co-hosted the lunch with Richard Perle, said of Mr Fakhravar: [...] "He's a unifying figure. He's strong physically and psychologically.

50|$|National Skyline is an American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} formed in late 1996 by Jeff Dimpsey of Hum.

They did record the 45-minute song/album with Rick Valentin (of <b>The</b> <b>Poster</b> <b>Children)</b> in spring 1997, but {{it has never been}} released. The band's name is apparently a reference to Bob Dylan's album Nashville Skyline, though their music betrays no stylistic debt to Dylan.|$|R

40|$|Eurasians are 'in'. We are <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> of globalisation.

Terms previously used to demarcate impure outsiders such as Eurasian mixed-race, hybridity, mestiza, hapa, haafu, Euro-Asian and Anglo-Asian have recently been given an affirmative spin. This essay argues that the appeal, allure and persuasions of Eurasian/mixed-race are as much an effect of its commodified production as a cosmopolitan figure with automatic racial, cultural and national border crossing attributes, as its capacity and potential to claim for itself a location and space of visibility. Framed as a performative, the visual aesthetics and cosmopolitan attributes of Eurasian/mixed-race are explored in relation to postcolonial practices of racialisation and sexualisation under globalisation. Factors evoked in the constitution of Eurasian/mixed race delimit rather than preclude its promise of an expansive transnational/transcultural cosmopolitan future...|$|R

Graphene is the youngest in the family of carbon nanomaterials. Its isolation, description, and mass fabrication has followed that of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Graphene's development and its adoption by many indus-tries will increase unintended or intentional human exposure, creating the need to determine its safety profile. In this Account, we compare the {{lessons learned from the}} development of carbon nanotubes with what is known about graphene, based on our own investigations and those of others. Despite both being carbon-based, nanotubes and graphene are two very distinct nanomaterials. We consider the key physicochemical characteristics (structure, surface, colloidal properties) for graphene and carbon nanotubes at three different physiological levels: cellular, tissue, and whole body. We summarize the evidence for health effects of both materials at all three levels. Overall...|$|R
