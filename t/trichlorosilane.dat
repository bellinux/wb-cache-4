25|$|Silicon in {{its more}} common {{crystalline}} form {{was not prepared}} until 31 years later, by Deville. By electrolyzing a mixture of sodium chloride and aluminium chloride containing approximately 10% silicon, {{he was able to}} obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in 1854. Later, more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms, the most recent being silicene in 2010. Meanwhile, research on the chemistry of silicon continued; Friedrich Wöhler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon, synthesising <b>trichlorosilane</b> in 1857 and silane itself in 1858, but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early 20th century by Alfred Stock, despite early speculation on the matter dating {{as far back as the}} beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s. Similarly, the first organosilicon compound, tetraethylsilane, was synthesised by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1863, but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemisry was only done in the early 20th century by Frederick Kipping.|$|E
25|$|Leaching {{powdered}} 96–97% pure silicon {{with water}} results in ~98.5% pure silicon, {{which is used}} in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or <b>trichlorosilane.</b> The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of silicone production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation, followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as the reeducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by zone refining. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another process used is the reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate, a common waste product of the phosphate fertiliser industry, by metallic sodium: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained.|$|E
30|$|The use of <b>trichlorosilanes</b> as {{functional}} molecules {{is necessary}} for the preparation of SAM-MSNs with high surface coverage. A low surface coverage was obtained (about 20 %) when trialkoxyorganosilanes were used for deposition of monolayers on the MSNs surface, whereas a high surface coverage was possible when trialkoxyorganosilanes was used to functionalize the bulk mesoporous silica. The reason for this different behavior might be that the functional molecules are very easy to be transferred out of the pores of MSNs during the functionalization process. So, a functional molecule with a higher activity is essential to be hydrolyzed and deposited on the pore walls of MSNs. <b>Trichlorosilanes</b> show higher active toward the absorbed water than trialkoxyorganosilanes. Especially, the hydrolysis of <b>trichlorosilanes</b> generates HCl which can greatly enhance the condensation reaction between neighboring silanes, as well as between the hydroxylsilanes and the polar oxide surface, 24 leading to closely packed monolayers on the oxide surface.|$|R

We investigated surface melting of liquid crystals on these surfaces by observing the anchoring transition (change {{in the direction of}} alignment) that usually accompanies surface melting. Surface melting was observed only on substrates that had undulating surface morphologies due to either a low molecular density or interspersed arrangement of the two types of <b>trichlorosilanes.</b> We attributed the surface melting to the influence of molecular-level surface roughness on liquid crystal order parameters near the surfac...|$|R

40|$|A new {{route to}} improve {{anti-adhesive}} properties of Si stamps used in nanoimprint lithography {{was developed by}} using co-evaporation of fluorinated mono- and <b>trichlorosilanes.</b> It {{was found that the}} improvement of the coating quality results from a self-organization between the two silanes in a manner of end-capping the reactive trichloro-group by the monochlorosilane. In nanoimprint lithography (NIL), it is essential to provide stamps with good anti-sticking surface properties. A low surface energy release layer on the stamps helps to improve the imprint quality, and it also increases the stamp lifetime significantly by preventing surface contamination. Low adhesion and friction at structure sidewalls can only be assured if the stamp is fully covered with a durable anti-adhesive layer, which sustains high temperatures and pressures of the NIL process [1]. Fluorinated <b>trichlorosilanes</b> are often used as anti-adhesive layers for Si stamps due to the stable covalent anchoring. They provide in many cases satisfactory results. However, the dense and fully cross-linked film is not easily achieved due to the O-Si-O distance not leaving enough space for parallel, upright-standing fluorinated carbon chains [2]. In addition, the trichloro-silanes have some tendency to polymerize to bulk deposits. Therefore, we pursued a new route of the silane coating leading to a lower of surface energy and the absence of the polymerized bulk deposits by co-evaporating fluorinated C 8 mono-(TFDS) and <b>trichlorosilanes</b> (TFS) in the gas phase.

30|$|The SAM-MSNs were synthesized, and the {{relative}} surface coverage of the organic monolayers can reach up to 100 %. It was found that an appropriate level interfacial hydration, the use of <b>trichlorosilanes</b> as functional molecules, and the functional groups with less steric hindrance are essential to generate MSNs with high surface coverage of monolayers. The functional monolayers provide special attributes (such as binding sites, stereochemical configuration, and special interface properties) for mesoporous silica surface.

30|$|Mesoporous silica {{nanoparticles}} (MSNs) containing vinyl-, propyl-, isobutyl- and phenyl functionalized monolayers were reported. These functionalized MSNs {{were prepared}} via molecular self-assembly of organosilanes on the mesoporous supports. The relative surface {{coverage of the}} organic monolayers can reach up to 100 % (about 5.06 silanes/nm 2). These monolayer functionalize MSNs were analyzed {{by a number of}} techniques including transmission electron microscope, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern, cross-polarized Si 29 MAS NMR spectroscopy, and nitrogen sorption measurement. The main elements (i.e., the number of absorbed water, the reactivity of organosilanes, and the stereochemistry of organosilane) that greatly affected the surface coverage {{and the quality of the}} organic functionalized monolayers on MSNs were fully discussed. The results show that the proper amount of physically absorbed water, the use of high active <b>trichlorosilanes,</b> and the functional groups with less steric hindrance are essential to generate MSNs with high surface coverage of monolayers.|$|R
50|$|After {{polymerization}} and cross-linking, solid PDMS samples {{will present}} an external hydrophobic surface. This surface will appear metallic and shiny, although the substrate is clear. This surface chemistry {{makes it difficult}} for polar solvents (such as water) to wet the PDMS surface, and may lead to adsorption of hydrophobic contaminants. Plasma oxidation can be used to alter the surface chemistry, adding silanol (SiOH) groups to the surface. Atmospheric air plasma & argon plasma will work for this application. This treatment renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing water to wet it. This is frequently required for water-based microfluidics. The oxidized surface resists adsorption of hydrophobic and negatively charged species. The oxidized surface can be further functionalized by reaction with <b>trichlorosilanes.</b> After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface's hydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is vacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minutes.|$|R
2500|$|Speculation on {{silicon hydride}} {{chemistry}} started from the 1830s, contemporary {{with the development}} of synthetic organic chemistry. Silane itself, as well as <b>trichlorosilane,</b> were first synthesised by Friedrich Wöhler and Heinrich Buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium–silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid, and characterised as SiH4 and SiHCl3 by Charles Friedel and Albert Ladenburg in 1867. Disilane (Si2H6) followed in 1902, when it was first made by Henri Moissan and Samuel Smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium silicides. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that Alfred Stock began the study of silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the boron hydrides. The names silanes and boranes are due to him, based on analogy with the alkanes. Moissan and Smiles' method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via [...] protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, and thus the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method to produce substituted silanes.|$|E

40|$|Modifying the {{chemistry}} of a surface has been widely used to influence interfacial properties of a material or nature of interaction between two materials. This article provides an overview {{on the role of}} polyfunctional molecules, specifically silanes, in surface modification of polar surfaces (bearing soft nucleophiles). An emphasis on the mechanism of the reaction in the presence of adsorbed water, where the modifying reagents are hydrolysable, is discussed. To highlight the complexity of the reaction, modification of paper with <b>trichlorosilanes</b> is highlighted. Preparation of hydrophobic cellulosic paper, and structure–property relations under different treatment conditions is used to highlight that a monolayer is not always formed during the surface modification. Gel-formation via step-growth polymerization suggests that at the right monomer:adsorbed water ratio, a monolayer will not form but rather self-assembly driven particle formation will occur leading to a textured surface. The review highlights recent work indicating that the focus on monolayer formation, is at the very least, not always the case but gel formation, with concomitant self-assembly, might be the culprit in understanding challenges {{associated with the use of}} polyfunctional molecules in surface modification...|$|R
30|$|Oligo(ethylene glycol) {{materials}} {{have been demonstrated}} previously to be susceptible to photodegradation at 244  nm. Ducker et al. [36] found that triethylene glycol functionalized SAMs of alkylthiolates on gold were rapidly degraded by UV exposure to yield protein-binding aldehyde functional groups. Subsequently, plasma-polymerized tetraglyme [41], poly(oligoethylene methacrylate) polymer brushes [42] and monolayers [20, 43] have been modified by photodegradation, to facilitate protein patterning. In this paper, we present a simple method for patterning proteins on glass, based on spatially selective photodegradation of a protein-resistant film formed by the adsorption of 2 -[methoxy(polyethylenoxy)propyl] <b>trichlorosilanes</b> to yield protein-binding regions. Films of this adsorbate have been patterned previously using conventional photolithography involving exposure and development of a photoresist [44]; here we demonstrate direct patterning by photodegradation and also the fabrication of nanometer scale patterns by interferometric lithography. The use of processes {{that do not require}} photoresist is likely to be important in the development of strategies for the fabrication of multicomponent protein nanopatterns redeposition and development of photoresist in successive steps would damage proteins attached to the surface. Thus, {{there is a need for}} simple methods that involve direct conversion of protein-resistant materials to protein-binding ones.|$|R
40|$|Polysilsesquioxanes are a {{class of}} {{siloxane}} polymers commonly prepared by the hydrolysis and condensation of trialkoxysilanes or <b>trichlorosilanes.</b> From a trifunctional monomer one would expect the organically-modified polymers to be highly crosslinked and insoluble resins. However, while some silsesquioxane monomers with R = H, CH{sub 3 }, or vinyl do form crosslinked polymers capable of forming gels, the majority react to form soluble oligosilsesquioxanes, including discrete polyhedral oligomers, and polymers. Because of their solubility, ladder structures have been proposed. However, viscosity studies by Frye indicate that the polyphenylsilsesquioxane is more likely best represented by a polymer rich in both cyclic structures and branches, but without any regular stereochemistry. In this study, the authors have examined the hydrolysis and condensation polymerizations of phenyltrialkoxysilane, benzyltrialkoxysilane, and 2 -phenethyltrialkoxysilane monomers under both acidic and basic conditions. The resulting phenyl, benzyl and phenethyl-substituted polysilsesquioxanes were characterized by {sup 1 }H, {sup 13 }C, {sup 29 }Si NMR, gel permeation chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry.

40|$|AbstractChemical {{grafting}} {{of small}} molecule reagents onto polymeric fibrous materials, like paper, {{has been used}} to modify their wetting properties. Several reagents like <b>trichlorosilanes,</b> which can react with water or hydroxyls, have been used with the expectation that a monolayer, single molecule or polymerized single-molecule layer, is formed on the paper fiber surface. Presence of adsorbed water, however, would complicate the formation of a monolayer, especially in case of polyvalent reagents. We hypothesized that adsorbed water is a good co-monomer for polyvalent water-reactive reagents, therefore chemical grafting with polyvalent molecules would give polymeric gels instead of a monolayer. Reaction of trivalent reagents with paper in vacuo leads to formation of polymeric gels. By optimizing surface energy mismatch, through felicitous choice of chemical moieties on the monomer, self-assembly leads to formation of nano- to micro particles on the surface of paper fibers. We observe that, as expected, the wetting properties correlate well with the size and distribution of particles. We conclude that the recently reported ultra-hydrophobicity of chemically modified paper is not only due to inherent roughness of the paper fibers, but also due to a secondary roughness introduced by surface polymerization. Using this technique, we prepared amphi-phobic biomimetic surfaces inspired by the namib beetle. This talk will also address potential utility of such surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The use of organofunctional silane {{chemistry}} is a flexible and general method for immobilizing biomolecules on silicon oxide surfaces, including fabricating DNA, small-molecule, and protein microarrays. The biggest hurdle in employing dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) for extending this general {{approach to the}} nanoscopic domain is the tendency of trialkoxy- and <b>trichlorosilanes</b> to rapidly polymerize due to hydrolysis reactions. The control of the local water concentration between the substrate surface and the scanning AFM tip is critical, both to the physical and chemical processes involved in DPN writing and {{to the ability to}} form well-defined thin layers of reactive silanes without extensive polymerization induced disorder. We found that we could control the degree of polymerization through careful choice of the alkoxysilane used as the “ink” for DPN and through control of the relative humidity during inking and writing with the coated AFM tip. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that areas patterned with an alkoxysilane on glass with DPN are functional for subsequent immobilization of fluorescently labeled streptavidin via covalent attachment of biotin.

Apertured lithography {{was carried out}} by means of an argon ion laser (364 nm) coupled to cantilever-type near-field probes with a thin film of titania deposited over the aperture. Apertureless lithography was carried out with a helium–cadmium laser (325 nm) to excite titanium-coated, contact-mode atomic force microscope (AFM) probes. This latter approach is readily implementable on any commercial AFM system. Photodegradation occurred in both cases through the localized photocatalytic degradation of the monolayer. For alkanethiols, degradation of one thiol exposed the bare substrate, enabling refunctionalization of the bare gold by a second, contrasting thiol. For alkylsilanes, degradation of the adsorbate molecule provided a facile means for protein patterning. Lines were written in a protein-resistant film formed by the adsorption of oligo(ethylene glycol) -functionalized <b>trichlorosilanes</b> on glass, leading to the formation of sub- 100 nm adhesive, aldehyde-functionalized regions.

50|$|One common way of synthesizing {{tertiary}} phosphine ligands is by deoxygenation of phosphine oxides (OPR3) with <b>trichlorosilane.</b> Deoxygenation proceeds with retention or {{inversion of}} configuration, depending on conditions.

The stereochemical course is explained mechanistically by complexation followed by intramolecular hydride transfer. On the other hand, the inversion of configuration in the presence of triethylamine is explained by complexation followed by intermolecular hydride transfer from a 1:1 triethylamine-trichlorosilane complex in an SN2 reaction.

Remaining chlorosilane groups were reacted by a second alcohol treatment to obtain air-stable, highly condensed, and low OH_containing sols.

Although the rate of degradation is substantially slower than for monolayers of OEG terminated thiolates on gold, it is nevertheless possible to form micrometer-scale patterns by elective adsorption of streptavidin to exposed regions. A low density of aldehyde functional groups is produced, and this enables derivatization with nitrilotriacetic acid via an amine linker. Complexation with nickel enables the site-specific immobilization of histidine-tagged yellow and green fluorescent proteins. Nanometer-scale patterns may be fabricated using a Lloyd’s mirror interferometer, with a sample and mirror set {{at right angles to}} each other. At low exposures, partial degradation of the OEG chains does not remove the protein-resistance of the surface, even though friction force microscopy reveals the formation of patterns. At an exposure of ca. 18  J cm− 2, the modified regions became adhesive to proteins in a narrow region ca. 30  nm (λ/ 8) wide. As the exposure is increased further the lines quickly broaden to ca. 90  nm. Adjustment of the angle between the sample and mirror enables the fabrication of lines of His-tagged green fluorescent protein at a period of 340  nm that could be resolved using a confocal microscope.|$|R

From detailed solution chemistry of trimethyl-, trimethoxy-, and triphenyl-chloro/amino-silanes, two general processes {{have been developed for}} the self-assembly of long alkyl chain terminated alcohols, thiols, and carboxylic acids on inorganic oxide surfaces i. e., glass, quartz and single crystal silicon. The first method involves three successive reactions with the surface moieties where the initially formed silylchloride layer is converted to a silylamine, which is then reacted further to give the organic monolayers. The second method involves a single reaction of the surface with surfactant species formed first by reacting trimethoxysilylchloride with the appropriate chromophore. The chemistry and comparative advantages of these two methods are discussed. A discussion on the complete characterization of newly formed thin films by employing surface techniques, such as wettability, FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and X-ray reflectivity, is provided. These results indicate that thin films formed using simple acid-base hydrolytic chemistry are comparable to those obtained from more established techniques, such as <b>trichlorosilanes</b> on glass, thiols on gold, and carboxylic acids on silver or alumina.
