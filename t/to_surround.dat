5|$|On 12 October, French troops {{backed by}} tanks, {{artillery}} and aerial support launched an operation <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> and eliminate al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned among the trees, the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter {{were unable to}} lure the rebels out and retreated.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia {{continued}} to flee westward. Infantry led by Generals John Brown Gordon and James Longstreet, and cavalry led by Fitzhugh Lee formed a battle line near the Appomattox Court House. This was their {{last chance to}} escape to Lynchburg, as Union troops were attempting <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Women of {{high status}} lived in {{seclusion}} at court and, through strategic marriages, {{were used to}} gain political power for their families. Despite their seclusion, some women wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive salons, dependent {{on the quality of}} those attending. Ichijō's mother and Michinaga's sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted Shōshi <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon.|$|E

5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E
5|$|At a {{ceremony}} where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, Professor X, Hank, and Wolverine search for Mystique, {{disguised as a}} Secret Service agent. Magneto appears, controlling the Sentinels, and uses the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> the White House. Hank transforms into Beast and fights a sentinel. Wolverine confronts Magneto, but is thrown way into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and Mystique hide in a safe room beneath the White House, but Magneto rips {{it out of the}} building with the intention of killing Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Ceremonies came <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> many {{memorials}}; many memorials were formally opened or {{unveiled in}} public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. Memorials in Britain and France were typically opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the next-of-kin of fallen servicemen. Some memorials acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle call at the Menin Gate memorial each evening, for example, and this practice spread to many other similar memorials in France.|$|E

5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
5|$|Having {{isolated}} Damascus, Khalid {{ordered his}} army <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> {{the city on}} August 21, 634 (the 20th of Jamadi-ul-Akhir, 13 Hijri). The corps commanders were instructed to repel any Byzantine attack from the respective gates, and seeking assistance {{in the case of}} heavy attack. Dharar bin al-Azwar commanded 2.000 horsemen from the mobile guard to patrol in the empty areas between the gates at night and to reinforce any corps attacked by the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> it with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E
5|$|The French {{military}} strategy against Austria {{was for a}} three-pronged invasion <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender and acceptance of French Revolutionary ideals. The French assembled the Army of Sambre and Meuse commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan against the Austrian Army of the Lower Rhine in the north; the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau, opposed the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine {{in the south and}} the Army of Italy commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte approached Vienna through northern Italy.|$|E

5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese had {{excellent}} {{coordination between}} light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics of quick airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force (Força Aérea Portuguesa or FAP) <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> {{and eliminate the}} guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied {{by the use of}} heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.|$|E
5|$|The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, {{but after}} initial success, their advance {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and along the Paraguay River. Porto Alegre had {{remained}} behind, leading the 2nd Corps and guarding Rio Grande do Sul. Mitre, no longer on Brazilian territory and acknowledged as the allied commander-in-chief, planned to use Porto Alegre's army to march through Paraguayan territory from the rear <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> Humaitá. As {{a result of a}} suggestion by Tamandaré—though Mitre had not issued orders for the move—Porto Alegre boarded his army onto Brazilian ships and instead brought them up to the positions occupied by the other allied troops.|$|E

5|$|The operation's codename, Ring, {{referred}} to the encirclement of the towns of Getashen and Martunashen by the Soviet MVD and armed forces. A date in late April was chosen for the commencement of the operation, which called for Soviet troops <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> the towns and search the villages for both illegally procured weapons and Armenian guerrilla fighters. Reacting to the growing violence, Gorbachev had also assigned units of the Soviet 4th Army's predominantly Azerbaijani 23rd Motorized Rifle Division, stationed along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, {{to serve as a}} buffer force. The 23rd Division and other elements of the Fourth Army were selected along with the Azerbaijani OMON to take part in Ring.|$|E

5|$|At night, A Syrian force {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>surround</b> the Israelis by {{crossing the}} Jordan River {{to the north}} of the Sea of Galilee, but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded. This was spotted and reported by the Israelis at Tabgha, and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children, elderly and sick, as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the Poria-Alumot region. In the panic of surprise, many men also tried to flee the frontal villages, but blockposts were set up near Afula and Yavne'el by the Military Police Service's northern command, under Yosef Pressman, who personally stopped buses and allowed only the women and children to proceed to safety.|$|E
