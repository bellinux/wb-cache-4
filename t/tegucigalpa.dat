5|$|The native {{settlement}} of <b>Tegucigalpa</b> was first {{recorded by the}} Spanish in 1536. Spanish miners founded colonial <b>Tegucigalpa</b> in 1578, having headed south from Comayagua and discovered silver and other minerals in {{the mountains to the}} east of the native settlement. The colonial town was established as a real de minas, an administrative centre for controlling the mines, and where the ore was smelted. The town was in a bowl-shaped valley on the upper Choluteca River, close to the convergence of three tributary streams. Spanish <b>Tegucigalpa</b> was next to Comayagüela, which remained a purely indigenous settlement. Thanks to the local mineral wealth, <b>Tegucigalpa</b> grew rapidly in size as it attracted Spanish settlers and their native workers. The Franciscans established a convent there by 1592, and the Mercedarians established their own convent about four decades afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Hahneman used {{a handgun}} to hijack an Eastern Airlines 727 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in May, demanded $303,000, and {{eventually}} parachuted into Honduras, his country of birth. A month later, with the FBI in pursuit and a $25,000 bounty on his head, he {{surrendered to the}} American Embassy in <b>Tegucigalpa.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October26, the Honduran Permanent Contingency Commission {{coordinated with}} {{neighboring}} countries regarding the storm. Officials initially issued {{a state of}} emergency for the offshore islands and five coastal departments, which was later extended {{to the rest of the}} country. The government increased emergency spending and created a National Emergency Commission. Officials advised residents to evacuate in flood-prone areas, although many people stayed for fear of being looted. Some left to stay with relatives during the hurricane. Prisoners in <b>Tegucigalpa</b> Central Penitentiary were evacuated to the national stadium.|$|E

50|$|Statues and busts of Francisco Morazán can {{be found}} in Chile, El Salvador, United States, Spain, and elsewhere. The most famous and {{controversial}} is the equestrian statue of Morazán located in <b>Tegucigalpa's</b> Central Park.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tegucigalpa's</b> {{economic}} {{challenges are}} tied {{to those of the}} rest of the country, such as overcoming crime, anomalies in the judicial system, educational backwardness, and deficient infrastructure in order to continue to encourage foreign investors and permit growth of local entrepreneurs.|$|R
5|$|Overall {{cost for}} {{reconstruction}} {{was estimated at}} $2.5billion, which was estimated to take four years. The cost for repairing the damaged houses was estimated at $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of <b>Tegucigalpa</b> within a month of the storm striking.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000people in Honduras, with 11,000missing in {{the months}} after the storm. There were 8,000people listed as missing about ten days after Mitch struck, {{although}} problems with record-keeping made it difficult to determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Morazán Department, which includes <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> had about 1,000deaths, and Yoro Department had 911fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves or were cremated. The storm injured 12,272people nationwide, mostly in Choluteca and Cortés departments.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tegucigalpa's</b> {{population}} density in 2001 was at 99 persons per hectare. However, {{the distribution of}} inhabitants varies greatly throughout {{different areas of the}} city. In general, people prefer to live on steep hillsides where landslides are of considerable concern or in the river valley where flooding is a constant danger.|$|R
5|$|In León {{near where}} it moved ashore in Nicaragua, {{the passage of}} Alma left the city without power. Several {{buildings}} were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of León and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable, and another person died in a similar manner. Offshore, one person drowned when he rode out the storm in his boat. In <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> TACA Flight 390 skidded off a runway sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty. One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in a raging stream.|$|E
5|$|On October29, Honduras President Ricardo Maduro {{declared}} a State of National Emergency as Beta was forecast to bring heavy rains up to 12in (300mm). Three departments, Gracias a Dios, Colon, Olancho and El Paraiso, were placed under Red Alert and mandatory evacuations {{were put in}} place. The departments of Atlántida, Yoro, Comayagua, Francisco Morazán and Choluteca were placed under Yellow Alert and a Green Alert was {{in place for the}} rest of the country. The Local Emergency Management Agency opened its regional and municipal offices to conduct preparative activities. An emergency radio network was set up to alert the public of any emergencies. The government designated several public schools as shelters for the affected population. In the Francisco Morazán Department, the <b>Tegucigalpa</b> Municipal Emergency Committee opened 73 shelters. Extensive cleaning and garbage disposal was conducted, especially around creeks, rivers, and sewers. The National Armed Forces were placed in strategic areas and were on stand-by for search and rescue operations once the storm passed. About 3,306tons (3,000tonnes) of food was reported to be available and local travels in the country were suspended. In <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> the emergency committee called for the evacuation of 125,000 people from the most vulnerable areas of the capital. About 8,000 others were evacuated from 50 communities along the Nicaragua border due to the threat of flooding. A hurricane alert was put in place for areas north of the Nicaragua border but was cancelled on October30 after Beta turned towards the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{established}} Comayagua, originally called Nueva Valladolid de Comayagua ("New Valladolid of Comayagua") and Valle de Santa María de Comayagua ("Valley of Saint Mary of Comayagua"), {{as one of}} four top-tier gobiernos in Central America {{that served}} as administrative centres for commerce and industry. They established less important centres, such as <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> as alcaldías mayores, and more sparsely colonised areas as corregimientos. A number of indigenous settlements, referred to as pueblos de indios ("Indian villages"), comprised a corregimiento. The colonial corregidor governed the corregimiento, but the Spanish also appointed native officials, including the alcalde (or mayor) and his regidores, or councillors. All levels of colonial government were concerned with the collection of tribute and the organisation of native labour.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tegucigalpa's</b> {{infrastructure}} has {{not kept}} up with its population growth. [...] Deficient urban planning, densely condensed urbanization, and poverty are ongoing problems. [...] Heavily congested roadways where current road infrastructure is unable to efficiently handle over 400,000 vehicles create havoc on a daily basis. [...] Both current national and local governments have taken steps to improve and expand infrastructure {{as well as to}} reduce poverty in the city.|$|R
5000|$|As {{contributions}} to culture wrote several pastorelas, reconstructed by Rómulo Durón, {{which are the}} first theatrical manifestations in Central America, and whose thereof representation established bases for the subsequent appearance of theatre in Honduras. These pastorelas was presented by Father Reyes in the <b>Tegucigalpa's</b> churches, {{one of these is}} [...] "Navidad nuestra" [...] ("Our Christmas"), which over time has converted a classic of Honduran contemporary theater owing to its harmonious mixing of different traditions presents on Honduran Christmas.|$|R
50|$|Policymaking, regulation, {{and service}} {{provision}} {{in water and}} sanitation are interconnected processes and enhance communication between sectors (including energy production, agriculture, industry, water supply and sanitation, urban planning, and environmental protection), and between different actors. In response to <b>Tegucigalpa’s</b> challenges, two advances have originated from coalitions between government actors and civil society.One proved critical {{to the protection of}} one of the City’s earlier water sources, the Picacho water treatment plant, which captures water from mountains within the temperate rainforest of La Tigra.|$|R
5|$|The rampant Cangrejal River {{reportedly}} obliterated {{an entire}} suburban community further east, near La Ceiba, while the Aguán River burst its banks at Trujillo and killed numerous plantation workers. By October 29, {{the bodies of}} 70 flood victims had been recovered at Corocito in Colón. Torrential rains extended into <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> causing urban flooding. Just to the northeast, in San Juancito, a large landslide took the lives {{of at least three}} people. Overall, the hurricane inflicted about $12 million in damage across Honduras (including the agricultural impacts), resulted in about 150 deaths, and destroyed the homes of thousands of residents. The floods were considered to be among the worst in the country's history. Almost immediately after the passage of the storm, a wide area of Honduras experienced strong earthquake activity.|$|E
5|$|In the storm's {{immediate}} aftermath, officials {{enacted a}} widespread curfew after reports of looting and vandalism. The government temporarily restricted constitutional rights for 15days. Officials urged residents to restrict water and fuel use, and alcohol sales were halted. The widespread flooding and the crippled infrastructure forced officials {{to rely on}} a limited number of helicopters to operate search and rescue missions and deliver supplies. A helicopter carrying fourpeople, including <b>Tegucigalpa</b> mayor and potential presidential candidate César Castellanos, crashed on November1 while touring flood damage, killing everyone aboard. In some areas, residents did not receive assistance until November12, more than two weeks after Mitch's landfall. About 285,000people remained in 1,375shelters, many of them schools, by three weeks after the hurricane struck. Some sports stadiums and churches were also used as makeshift shelters. Overcrowding at shelters caused various diseases.|$|E
5|$|The President of Honduras {{estimated}} that Mitch set back 50years of economic development. The storm wrecked about 35,000houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5million people homeless, or about 20% of the country's population. Mitch directly caused $2.005billion in damage, {{with an additional}} $1.8billion in indirect costs. Most of the damage was ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4% in 1999, {{largely due to the}} storm. Over 70% of the transportation infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70% of the country lost water after the storm. In the capital, <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. Floods in the city damaged buildings that were over 350years old. Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000fatalities, some reported in each department.|$|E
50|$|After the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which {{included}} Honduras, became independent from Spain (on September 15, 1821) Francisco Morazán {{began to take}} an active part in politics and public administration. He worked at <b>Tegucigalpa's</b> City Hall as deputy mayor and public defender in civil and criminal court cases. Such activities allowed him to acquire a great knowledge of the structure and operation of the public administration of the province. This job also allowed him to get in close contact with the problems of post-colonial society.|$|R
50|$|Urbanization {{threatens the}} quality of the city’s {{surrounding}} watersheds and while the urbanization rate may slow, <b>Tegucigalpa's</b> population is expected to reach 2 million by 2029 thus doubling the 2008 population. Growth is expected in the west but this would encroach on a major watershed that supplies 30% of the city's water. In the south, development is also encroaching on the city’s other major reservoir, La Concepcion. This expansion has resulted in an increase of deforestation within protected areas in the watersheds. This is a serious problem that is contributing to sedimentation of river channels and increasing the potential for flooding on the Choluteca River and its tributaries.|$|R
5|$|Even {{before the}} storm struck, the {{government}} of Honduras issued an appeal for international assistance. In the immediate aftermath, the United States provided $875,000 in aid. A portion went to purchasing and delivering food, while the majority utilized airplanes to participate in rescue missions and deliver supplies, such as plastic sheets and water. The United States ultimately gave $15million in aid to Honduras through various United Nations organizations. Mexico donated food, medicine, and clothing, and Cuba sent a team of doctors and mobile hospitals. Uruguay donated a pump {{for the city of}} Choluteca to restore water there. Several European Countries sent aid to Honduras, in addition to donations from the European Union. France sent medical equipment, and the government of Japan provided a field hospital that helped 300patients per day in the center of <b>Tegucigalpa.</b> Following the storm, the United Nations Development Programme sent a team to Honduras and El Salvador to determine the needs of the population. The Honduran government requested the team to assess the socio-economic impact of the storm. The World Food Programme provided $17million worth of food to the country. The Pan American Health Organization focused on restoring water systems by providing latrines, while UNICEF sent large water tanks.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot up for grabs. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of <b>Tegucigalpa,</b> was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by El Salvador, and was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E
5|$|With a mid-level ridge {{located in}} the Gulf of Mexico, the {{depression}} drifted generally northward through an area of warm water temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status. However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500UTC on May 29 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55miles (85km) southwest of Managua, Nicaragua. Its intensity was set at 45mph (75km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity only slightly more before moving ashore. However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65mph (100km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT. An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very tight ring of convection, and at around 1900UTC on May 29 Alma made landfall near León, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm. The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras. After passing near <b>Tegucigalpa</b> Alma weakened to tropical depression status, and at 1500UTC on May 30 the cyclone dissipated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala. On May 31, after crossing Central America as a low pressure area, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and spawned Tropical Storm Arthur.|$|E
