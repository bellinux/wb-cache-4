5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers {{to avoid}} flicker when {{dragging}} shapes or images across the screen. One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, {{and the other}} contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer {{was used as the}} basis of the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.|$|E

25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, {{especially}} Europe, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>different.</b> In Europe, even local calls are generally metered, so there was a strong incentive to keep the duration of the calls as short as possible. Point software employs standard compression (ZIP, ARJ, etc.) and so keeps the calls down to a few minutes a day at most. In contrast to North America, pointing saw rapid and fairly widespread uptake in Europe.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> {{in quality}} from the repressions of Jews which had {{occurred}} in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With {{the rise of the}} Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism. During the Middle Ages, Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration, but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad's persecutions.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{religions}} and animists {{with a deep}} concern {{for the preservation of}} their traditional ancestor religions declared their religion to be Hinduism, considering it a more flexible option than Islam, in the outer islands. In the early seventies, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to realize this opportunity by seeking shelter for their indigenous ancestor religion under the broad umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977. In central and southern Kalimantan, a large Hindu movement has grown among the local indigenous Dayak population which lead to a mass declaration of 'Hinduism' on this island in 1980. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the Javanese case, in that conversions followed a clear ethnic division. Indigenous Dayak were confronted with a mostly Muslim population of government-sponsored (and predominantly Madurese) migrants and officials, and deeply resentful at the dispossession of their land and its natural resources.|$|E

This was described as [...] "first-up, first-down", and meant that the All Blacks were better drilled—giving them a significant advantage. The All Blacks had also practised their line-outs, and as a result had a very good understanding between the player that threw in the line-out ball, and the player who was supposed to receive it.|$|E
500|$|As with Zippo Games' {{previous}} projects, {{the concept}} art was drawn on paper. The graphics were then drawn with Deluxe Paint and then translated into the ROM manually, sprite-by-sprite, as the NES hardware required precision in sprite placements; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from what Rare did, {{which was to}} place each pixel of the graphics sprites on graph paper with marker pens and then tasked people to type the code into the ROM. Ste Pickford said that while Rare's sprite-drawing method was easier, his method, while time-consuming, was more efficient. Most everything from the previous Wizards & Warriors games were removed, except for the main protagonist, Kuros, and the game's main antagonist, Malkil. The concept art was originally drawn in black and white, even though the games were being designed in color, to save money from photocopying or printing in color - {{both of which were}} very expensive at the time. In developing the [...] "Demon" [...] mini-boss, Pickford could only use about three animation frames, as the sprite was large for the NES hardware. Pickford designed the [...] "Worm" [...] boss similar to the bosses found in R-Type, where a series of smaller sprites formed a snake or worm-like enemy; however, he commented that [...] "it ended up in the game more like a giant floating head". Pickford drew inspiration from the thrones in Super Mario Bros. 3 in designing the final boss, Malkil.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Khamenei {{issued a}} fatwa stating {{that it was}} {{permitted}} to use a third-party (donor sperm, ova or surrogacy) in fertility treatments. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> in [...] "both style and substance" [...] to the fatwa on ART by Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak of Egypt's Al-Azhar University in the late 1980s which permitted ART (IVF and similar technologies) as long there is no third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses).|$|E

2500|$|Schiff {{responded to}} these claims {{and stated that}} the diminished {{capacity}} defense {{was an attempt to}} prevent the judge from rendering a summary judgment and instead allow a jury trial. Schiff also asserted that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from an insanity defense. Schiff, in his statement on the matter, asserted that the judge erred in not putting this question to the jury and insisted that [...] "(1) no one is required to pay income taxes; (2) the entire federal judiciary is involved in a monumental, criminal conspiracy to collect income taxes in violation of law." [...] As of August 2015, Schiff's internet web site still included a claim that the U.S. federal income tax had been repealed in the 1950s and that U.S. officials were engaged in a conspiracy: [...] "Since the income tax was repealed in 1954 when Congress adopted the 1954 Code, it is clear that for 50 years federal judges in conspiracy with U. S. Department of Injustice prosecutors have been illegally and criminally prosecuting people for crimes that do not exist in connection with a tax that nobody owes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rosenberg and Birdzell {{claims that}} the {{so-called}} [...] "eastern culture" [...] of [...] "respect" [...] and [...] "unquestionable devotion" [...] to the ruling dynasty was {{as a result of}} a culture where the control of the dynasty led to a [...] "silent society" [...] that [...] "did not ask questions or experiment without the approval or order from the ruling class". On the other hand, they claimed that the West of the late medieval era did not have a central authority or absolute state, which allowed for a free flow of ideas (Rosenberg, Birdzell, 1986). This so-called [...] "eastern culture" [...] also supposedly showed a [...] "dismissal of change" [...] due to their [...] "fear of failure" [...] and disregard for the imitation of outside inventions and science; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the [...] "western culture" [...] which they claimed to be willing to experiment and imitate others to benefit their society. They claimed that this was a culture where change was encouraged, and sense of anxiety and disregard for comfort led them to be more innovative. Max Weber argued in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism that capitalism in northern Europe evolved when the Protestant work ethic (particularly Calvinist) [...] influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In his book [...] he blames Chinese culture for the non-emergence of capitalism in China. Chen (2012) similarly claims that cultural differences were the most fundamental cause for the divergence, arguing that the Humanism of the Renaissance followed by the Enlightenment (including revolutionary changes in attitude towards religion) enabled a mercantile, innovative, individualistic, and capitalistic spirit. For Ming Dynasty China, he claims there existed repressive measures which stifled dissenting opinions and nonconformity. He claimed that Confucianism taught that disobedience to one's superiors was supposedly tantamount to [...] "sin". In addition Chen claimed that merchants and artificers had less prestige than they did in Western Europe. Justin Yifu Lin has argued for the role of the imperial examination system in removing the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation.|$|E
