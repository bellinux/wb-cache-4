25|$|In 1986 {{came the}} move that ended Rivers' {{longtime}} friendship with Johnny Carson, who had first hired {{her as a}} Tonight Show writer. The soon-to-launch Fox Television Network {{announced that it was}} giving her a late night talk show, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, making Rivers the first woman to have her own late night talk show on a major network. The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern Time, making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary, Johnny Carson: King of Late Night, Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have already heard about it and that he immediately hung up on her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the Tonight Show, a decision respected by Carson's first two successors Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. After the release of his 2013 biography on Johnny Carson, Carson's attorney Henry Bushkin revealed that he never received a call from Rivers' husband Edgar concerning the move to Fox, contrary to what Edgar had told Rivers. Rivers did not appear on the Tonight Show again until February 17, 2014, when she made a brief appearance on new host Jimmy Fallon's first episode. On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned for an interview.|$|E

Anita thinks about that from time to time, even thinking of Ramirez in that light but decides against it when being his girlfriend could compromise her status on the murder cases. Ramirez might be slightly sensitive as well, and Anita notes <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she's</b> more attracted to people who aren't entirely human like herself. Anita has thought before that as much as Richard and Jean-Claude embrace and desire her for her somewhat humanity, she embraces their inhumanity.|$|R

500|$|In 2009, she {{appeared}} in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> would cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Aurora's blurb on the Disney Princess website once {{cited the}} {{character}} as [...] "gentle and loving". Walt Disney introduced Aurora to Costa as [...] "a very layered character", describing her as [...] "different. She's calm, yet she's playful. She {{has a sense}} of humor, and she has an imagination." [...] Despite popular opinion that Aurora is a very passive character, Costa believes that the princess is actually [...] "very strong", citing her urge to defy her guardians as an example of her strength, while referring to the character as [...] "a beautiful personification of femininity." [...] Raised exclusively by three women in a very sheltered environment, Aurora had never been exposed to a man prior to meeting Phillip. Costa believes that, because of this, Aurora is [...] "innately romantic" [...] as opposed to simply lonely, explaining, there [...] "was a certain part of her <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> didn’t realize that was just so romantic and maybe expecting something that she didn’t even know what", and credits {{the fact that she was}} raised by three older women as opposed to her parents with making her [...] "a little bit older, and yet, she ... had this young outreaching spirit." [...] A very loving character, Aurora enjoyed her lonely life as much as she did because she had never experienced anything else. Additionally, the character's close companionship with woodland creatures is used to demonstrate that she is a loving individual.|$|E

At the age of 20, she taught herself to play the guitar and realizing that her true calling was in music, she went to Vancouver, British Columbia and there she attended Columbia Academy and learned the technical aspects of the music industry.

[...] Realizing that Jean-Claude, although bisexual, prefers women, Asher was able to form a stable relationship only with their mutual lover, Julianna. [...] After arriving in St. Louis, Asher {{fell in love with}} both Jean-Claude and Anita, but feared that they could not love him fully, either because of his scars or because of their feelings for each other. [...] Recently, he has accepted that both Jean-Claude and Anita love him for himself, although he is unwilling to be restricted to one-way monogamy with Anita, resulting in a longtime dalliance with Narcissus. (Many of Jean-Claude's vampires, and even Anita herself, assume that they have an affair but this relationship is denied by both of them.

He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details.
