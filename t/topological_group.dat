5000|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} in <b>topological</b> <b>groups,</b> {{an extension of}} <b>topological</b> <b>groups,</b> or a <b>topological</b> extension, is a short exact sequence [...] where [...] and [...] are <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> and [...] and [...] are continuous homomorphisms which are also open onto their images.

40|$|AbstractFirst we {{construct}} complete totally minimal <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> {{which are}} not locally compact. Extending and generalizing a construction of S. Dierolf and U. Schwanengel (using semi-direct products) we find then a class A of <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> such that all products of elements of A are minimal <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> This gives further examples of complete minimal <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> being not locally compact and partial answers to a question posed by A. V. Arhangel'skiǐ...|$|R

25|$|More generally, if G is any <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> and H {{a closed}} {{subgroup}} which {{also happens to}} be a Lie group, then G→G/H is a fiber bundle.|$|E
25|$|The Haar {{measure for}} a locally compact <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> is a {{generalization}} of the Lebesgue measure (and also of counting measure and circular angle measure) and has similar uniqueness properties.|$|E
25|$|As the {{universal}} covering group suggests, {{there is an}} analogy between the fundamental group of a <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> {{and the center of}} a group; this is elaborated at Lattice of covering groups.|$|E
40|$|Known and new {{results on}} free Boolean <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> are collected. An account of {{properties}} which these groups share with free or free Abelian <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> and properties specific of free Boolean groups is given. Special {{emphasis is placed}} on the application of set-theoretic methods to the study of Boolean <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> Comment: This is a revised and expanded version of a paper published in "Axioms. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of semitopological groups, a similar but weaker notion than that of <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> It is shown that all <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> are semitopological groups but that the {{converse}} is not true. This thesis investigates some of {{the conditions under which}} semitopological groups are, in fact, <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic group theory and topology...|$|R
5000|$|This {{property}} is interesting {{in the case}} of locally compact <b>topological</b> <b>groups,</b> since locally compact compactly generated <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> can be approximated by locally compact, separable metric factor groups of G. More precisely, for a sequence ...|$|R
25|$|Later, in 1975, R.Venkataraman ("Extensions of Pontryagin Duality", Math. Z. 143, 105-112) showed, {{among other}} facts, that every open {{subgroup}} of an abelian <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> which satisfies Pontryagin duality itself satisfies Pontryagin duality.|$|E
25|$|The {{generalization}} to functions taking {{values in}} any normed vector space is straightforward (replacing absolute values by norms), where f and g need not take their {{values in the}} same space. A generalization to functions g taking values in any <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> is also possible.|$|E
25|$|As a {{homotopy}} theory, {{the notion}} of covering spaces works well when the deck transformation group is discrete, or, equivalently, when the space is locally path-connected. However, when the deck transformation group is a <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> whose topology is not discrete, difficulties arise. Some {{progress has been made}} for more complex spaces, such as the Hawaiian earring; see the references there for further information.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} refined {{theory is}} available for pseudocompact <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> In particular, W. W. Comfort and Kenneth A. Ross proved that a product of pseudocompact <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> is still pseudocompact (this might fail for arbitrary topological spaces).|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{spectral}} sequence connecting the continuous and 'locally continuous' <b>group</b> cohomologies for <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> As an application it is shown that for contractible <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> these cohomology concepts coincide. Similar results for k-groups and smooth cochains on Lie groups are also obtained...|$|R
25|$|For every <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> G and its {{subgroup}} H {{the set of}} left cosets G/H is {{a uniform}} space {{with respect to the}} uniformity Φ defined as follows. The sets , where U runs over neighborhoods of the identity in G, form a fundamental system of entourages for the uniformity Φ. The corresponding induced topology on G/H is equal to the quotient topology defined by the natural map G → G/H.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> G (in particular, every topological vector space) {{becomes a}} uniform space if we define a subset V of G times& G {{to be an}} entourage {{if and only if}} it {{contains}} the set { (x, y) : x⋅yminus&1 in U } for some neighborhood U of the identity element of G. This uniform structure on G is called the right uniformity on G, because for every a in G, the right multiplication x → x⋅a is uniformly continuous with respect to this uniform structure. One may also define a left uniformity on G; the two need not coincide, but they both generate the given topology on G.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of extra structure relates {{these types of}} groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for abstract harmonic analysis, whereas Lie groups (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of differential geometry and unitary representation theory. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, compact connected Lie groups have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group Γ can be realized as a lattice in a <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> G, the geometry and analysis pertaining to G yield important results about Γ. A comparatively recent trend {{in the theory of}} finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups (profinite groups): for example, a single p-adic analytic group G has a family of quotients which are finite p-groups of various orders, and properties of G translate into the properties of its finite quotients.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{necessary}} and sufficient condition for completibility of <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> {{with respect to}} the maximal uniform structure and the class of <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> with the above-mentioned property are found. Results similar to factorization for continuous homomorphisms of R-factorizable uniform groups are extended to uniform groups...|$|R
40|$|A {{long time}} ago, in a galaxy far, far away, {{there were three}} {{distinguished}} and well-studied classes of <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> However, little was known about the three varieties of <b>topological</b> <b>groups</b> they generate. This thesis tells the tale of these varieties. It becomes apparent that the three varieties are all distinct and that one {{is in fact the}} variety of abelian <b>topological</b> <b>groups,</b> that is, their entire universe. The other two are comparatively small, however, no less important and interesting. A framework is established within which the three varieties are compared with each other and also come up against the varieties generated by other important classes of <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> Discoveries are made that will stun even the most brave [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|Compact paratopological <b>groups</b> are {{automatically}} <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
500|$|The [...] "restricted" [...] {{version of}} Hilbert's fifth problem (solved by Gleason) asks, more specifically, whether every locally Euclidean <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> is a Lie group. That is, if a group G has the {{structure}} of a topological manifold, can that structure be strengthened to a real analytic structure, so that within any neighborhood of an element of G, the group law is defined by a convergent power series, and so that overlapping neighborhoods have compatible power series definitions? Prior to Gleason's work, special cases of the problem had been solved by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, John von Neumann, Lev Pontryagin, and Garrett Birkhoff, among others.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{explicit}} realization, it also follows that the universal covering {{space of a}} path connected <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> H is again a path connected <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> G. [...] Moreover, the covering map is a continuous open homomorphism of G onto H with kernel Γ, a closed discrete normal subgroup of G: ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} a {{fundamental}} aspect that changes if we want to consider Pontryagin duality beyond the locally compact case. In E. Martin-Peinador, A reflexible admissible <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> must be locally compact, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 123 (1995), 3563–3566, it is proved that if G is a Hausdorff abelian <b>topological</b> <b>group</b> that satisfies Pontryagin duality and the natural evaluation pairing: ...|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} modern {{branches}} of harmonic analysis, having {{its roots in the}} mid-twentieth century, is analysis on <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b> The core motivating ideas are the various Fourier transforms, which can be generalized to a transform of functions defined on Hausdorff locally compact <b>topological</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
