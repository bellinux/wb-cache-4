5|$|With Crosby's initial three-year, {{entry-level}} contract set {{to expire}} {{at the end}} of the following season, the Penguins signed him to a five-year, $43.5million contract extension on July 10, 2007, ensuring his stay with the Penguins through the 2012–13 season. Midway through the subsequent season, Crosby recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick on December 20, 2007, in a game against the Boston Bruins. His first assist came 55seconds into the first period. At 8:26 of the same period, Crosby scored to give the Penguins a 2–0 lead. Then, five minutes and nine seconds into the second frame, Crosby fought defenceman Andrew Ference to complete the hat trick. This was Crosby's first NHL fight. In NHL's first Winter Classic (with a record crowd of 71,217 fans in attendance), Crosby scored the shootout winner in heavy snowfall to beat the Sabres. Two weeks later, however, on January 18, 2008, Crosby suffered a high ankle sprain crashing leg-first into the boards in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. As a result, he missed the 2008 All-Star Game, to which he was named a starter. After missing 21 games, he returned on March 4 against the Lightning and earned an assist. Two games after his return, however, he felt his ankle was not up to shape and decided that he needed more <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to heal. Crosby consequently sat out of the Penguins' next seven games and returned on March 27, 2008, to help the Penguins defeat the New York Islanders 3–1. In spite of the injury-shortened campaign, Crosby still managed 72 points in just 53 games.|$|E

25|$|The Montanist movement, which {{originated}} in Asia Minor, {{made its way}} to Rome and Gaul {{in the second half of}} the 2nd century, during the reign of Eleuterus. Its nature did not diverge so much from the orthodoxy of the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to initially be labeled heresy. During the violent persecution at Lyon, in 177, local confessors wrote from their prison concerning the new movement to the Asiatic and Phrygian communities as well as to Pope Eleuterus. The bearer of their letter to the pope was the presbyter Irenaeus, soon to become Bishop of Lyon. It appears from statements of Eusebius concerning these letters that the Christians of Lyon, though opposed to the Montanist movement, advocated patience and pleaded for the preservation of ecclesiastical unity.|$|E
25|$|Smallholders’ lump is {{produced}} by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees {{on their way to}} work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.|$|E

500|$|Teehan {{points out}} that {{although}} the Gavin Report recommended that radio stations withdraw the single from airplay, many stations did not comply with this request. In addition, Teehan notes that the radio ban was not suggested by the Gavin Report until April 29, 1966, almost seven weeks after the single had initially been released—ample <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to have made its mark on the charts. [...] Teehan has uncovered evidence showing that [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] was already decelerating on the national charts {{before the end of}} April 1966. He concludes that the groundbreaking song lacked strong commercial appeal by virtue of its complexity, unique sound, and excessive length (commercial radio stations were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long during the mid-1960s), and that it suffered from uncoordinated and inefficient promotion by Columbia Records.|$|E
500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company.

Take your own <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want me to come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in An Uncommon Story drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences. N.
