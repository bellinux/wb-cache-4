However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E

25|$|Soon illegal stag films or blue films, as {{they were}} called, were {{produced}} underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one {{at the risk of}} prison.|$|E
25|$|Such methods {{could be}} very {{effective}} in opencast mining, but fire-setting was very dangerous when used in underground workings. They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although hydraulic mining is still used on alluvial tin ores. They were also used to produce a controlled supply <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> crushed ore. It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy gold dust.|$|E
25|$|The {{wood was}} likely much larger originally, as extracting iron from its ore {{required}} great quantities of charcoal. Metal extraction also {{requires a lot}} of water <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> ore, a need fulfilled with the Branlin river flowing {{at the foot of the}} hill. The ore also needed to be crushed, and that was done in appropriate mills. Lastly, extracting iron required air to activate the bloomeries and the site is at the top of a hill, well exposed to winds.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the crushed ore. There were probably washing tables between the two tanks so that a gentle stream of water could be used <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> ore on the rough surface of the tables, the finer gold being caught in the rougher parts of the tables, and removed {{at the end of the}} process. The cascade would probably have been built towards the end of the 1st century when underground mining commenced following opencast development.|$|E
25|$|Before eating, most dining places provide {{either a}} {{hot or cold}} towel or a plastic-wrapped wet napkin (o-shibori). This is for {{cleaning}} hands before eating (and not after). It is rude to use them <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> face or {{any part of the}} body other than the hands, though some Japanese men use their o-shibori to wipe their faces in less formal places. Accept o-shibori with both hands when handed the towel by a server. When finished, fold or roll up the oshibori and place it on the table. It is impolite to use o-shibori towels to wipe any spills on the table.|$|E
25|$|Handspinners are split, when {{spinning}} wool, as {{to whether}} it is better to spin it 'in the grease' (with lanolin still in) or after it has been washed. More traditional spinners are more willing to spin in the grease, as it is less work <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> wool after it is in yarn form. Spinners who spin very fine yarn may also prefer to spin in the grease as it can allow them to spin finer yarns with more ease. Spinning in the grease covers the spinner's hands in lanolin and, thus, softens the spinner's hands.|$|E

25|$|According to the International Maritime Organisation {{oil spills}} can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention {{recognized}} that most oil pollution resulted from routine shipboard operations {{such as the}} cleaning of cargo tanks. In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of oil and water into the sea. OILPOL 54 prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended {{by means of an}} amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO. Meanwhile, IMO in 1965 set up a Subcommittee on Oil Pollution, under the auspices of its Maritime Safety committee, to address oil pollution issues.|$|E
25|$|For {{the nearly}} two decades of Napoleon III's reign, and for a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an {{enormous}} construction site. To bring fresh water to the city, his hydraulic engineer, Eugène Belgrand, built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the Vanne River in Champagne, and a new huge reservoir near the future Parc Montsouris. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic metres of water a day. He laid hundreds of kilometres of pipes to distribute the water throughout the city, and built a second network, using the less-clean water from the Ourq and the Seine, <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> streets and water the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the Paris sewers, and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new streetlights along the Paris streets.|$|E

25|$|Haussmann and Belgrand built new sewer tunnels {{under each}} {{sidewalk}} {{of the new}} boulevards. The sewers were designed to {{be large enough to}} evacuate rain water immediately; the large amount of water used <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> city streets; waste water from both industries and individual households; and water that collected in basements when the level of the Seine was high. Before Haussmann, the sewer tunnels (featured in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables) were cramped and narrow, just 1.8 meters high and 75 to 80 centimeters wide. The new tunnels were 2.3 meters high and 1.3 meters wide, large enough for men to work standing up. These flowed into larger tunnels that carried the waste water to even larger collector tunnels, which were 4.4 meters high and 5.6 meters wide. A channel {{down the center of the}} tunnel carried away the waste water, with sidewalks on either side for the égoutiers, or sewer workers. Specially designed wagons and boats moved on rails up and down the channels, cleaning them. Belgrand proudly invited tourists to visit his sewers and ride in the boats under the streets of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> crushed ore from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E
