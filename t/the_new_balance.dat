He led off a relay team of Renny Quow, Jereem Richards and Jarrin Solomon which went on to break the {{national}} indoor record for the event and take the bronze medal behind the United States and Great Britain. Outdoors, he set three personal bests on New York's Road to London meet series, setting times of 10.45 for the 100 metres and 20.62 for the 200m in May, before winning the 400m event in 45.33 seconds in June.

He debuted over the 10K road distance later that month and was runner-up to Sammy Kitwara at the World's Best 10K with a time of 27:45min. He won the Carlsbad 5K race in April, holding off Eliud Kipchoge, and took his first win on the Diamond League circuit with a victory at the Adidas Grand Prix in New York City. A run of 12:55.89min at the Golden Gala made him Ethiopia's second fastest 5000m runner that season and he was selected for the national team for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. He comfortably progressed through the qualifying round and the 5000m final came down to a four-way battle between himself, Farah, Lagat and Imane Merga. He was the last of the quartet to cross the line, but Imane Merga was disqualified after the medal ceremony as he had run outside of the track lanes. Dejen was promoted to the bronze medal, repeating his placing from the junior ranks three years previously.|$|E

Further, we extend this <b>new</b> <b>balancing</b> method to unstable linear time-varying discrete-time systems with periodically varying coefficient matrices. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>balancing</b> approach serves as basis to develop balancing related order reduction methods for unstable periodic systems using accuracy enhancing square-root and balancing-free algorithms...|$|R

6000|$|This {{was the big}} {{fact about}} Christian ethics; the {{discovery}} of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>balance.</b> Paganism had been like a pillar of marble, upright because proportioned with symmetry. Christianity was like a huge and ragged and romantic rock, which, though it sways on its pedestal at a touch, yet, because its exaggerated excrescences exactly balance each other, is enthroned there for a thousand years. In a Gothic cathedral the columns were all different, {{but they were all}} necessary. Every support seemed an accidental and fantastic support; every buttress was a flying buttress. So in Christendom apparent accidents balanced. Becket wore a hair shirt under his gold and crimson, and there is much to be said for the combination; for Becket got the benefit of the hair shirt while the people in the street got the benefit of the crimson and gold. It is at least better than the manner of the modern millionaire, who has the black and the drab outwardly for others, and the gold next his heart. But the balance was not always in one man's body as in Becket's; the balance was often distributed over the whole body of Christendom. Because a man prayed and fasted on the Northern snows, flowers could be flung at his festival in the Southern cities; and because fanatics drank water on the sands of Syria, men could still drink cider in the orchards of England. This is what makes Christendom at once so much more perplexing and so much more interesting than the Pagan empire; just as Amiens Cathedral is not better but more interesting than the Parthenon. If any one wants a modern proof of all this, let him consider the curious fact that, under Christianity, Europe (while remaining a unity) has broken up into individual nations. Patriotism {{is a perfect example of}} this deliberate balancing of one emphasis against another emphasis. The instinct of the Pagan empire would have said, [...] "You shall all be Roman citizens, and grow alike; let the German grow less slow and reverent; the Frenchmen less experimental and swift." [...] But the instinct of Christian Europe says, [...] "Let the German remain slow and reverent, that the Frenchman may the more safely be swift and experimental. We will make an equipoise out of these excesses. The absurdity called Germany shall correct the insanity called France." ...|$|E
40|$|The past 30 {{years has}} {{witnessed}} a worldwide decrease in real interest rates. Simultaneously over this period house prices {{have grown in}} real terms. We demonstrate that these trends {{can be explained by}} changes in demographic structure associated with the introduction of the pill in the early 1970 s. Following this, most of the western world, Japan and China saw similar reductions in fertility rates, though timing and magnitude differ among countries. In the long-run this leads to lower population growth. In the short-run the cohort born just before the introduction of the pill are disproportionally larger than cohorts born before and after. As this large cohort accumulates assets for retirement, aggregate savings supply increases which results in falling real interest rates and rising house prices. We find that an increase in house prices over the past decades was likely an efficient outcome that aided efficiency in the transition towards <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>balanced</b> growth path. However, housing's appreciation is a feature that can't be easily explained in a rational framework. Our model predicts that real interest rates will continue to fall, overshooting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>balanced</b> growth path level until hitting a trough at around the year 2035...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} incentive, effects of {{regional}} integration (or local protection) in current China in the dynamic context {{by using an}} R&D-based endogenous growth model. Given specific assumptions on the endogenous growth model refined from Chinese characteristics, we show that economic integration always makes both regions better off. Even with completely local protection for commodities flow but having technology flow, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>balanced</b> growth rate for two regions under integration are still higher that that under autarky. However, in the poor region with assumed low level of technology its R&D sector will diminish eventually, and its human capital in the R&D sector will move to the R&D sector in the rich region or the manufacturing sectors, in this case. Under completely economic integration with free commodities and technology flow, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>balanced</b> growth rate is higher and the human capital in the R&D sector in both regions will be same as before integration. That is the incentive for close economic integration. The interesting thing we show is the possibility to have a worst situation that both regions have {{the same level of}} technology and there is completely local protection. Then the balanced growth rate will be lower than that under autarky...|$|R
