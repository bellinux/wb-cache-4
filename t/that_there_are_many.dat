He cites the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years they {{were considered to be}} the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great numbers <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E
5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels of {{selection}} (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she {{has suggested that the}} popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle further noted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> bird forms {{within the}} bird kind – cranes, eagles, crows, bustards, sparrows, and so on, {{just as there}} are many forms of fishes within the fish kind. He {{sometimes}} called these atomon eidos, indivisible forms. Human is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates {{and the rest of us}} are all different individually, but we all have human form.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{allowed for}} the naming of Makemake and Haumea, and their formal recognition as plutoids and dwarf planets, bringing the number of IAU-accepted plutoids to four. However, the (co)discoverer of Eris, Makemake, and Haumea, Mike Brown, estimates that between 100 and 400 known bodies are plutoids, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> more {{that have yet to}} be discovered.

5|$|Thompson observes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> spirals in nature, {{from the}} horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes {{before moving on to}} the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E

Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They look in Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> people {{who would want to}} frame him.
