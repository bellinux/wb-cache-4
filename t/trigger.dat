5|$|Chrono <b>Trigger</b> Original Soundtrack is a Square-Enix re-release of the Chrono <b>Trigger</b> Original Sound Version soundtrack {{that was}} made {{available}} for purchase on July 29, 2009. This soundtrack corresponds to the Nintendo DS version of Chrono <b>Trigger,</b> with different instrumentation from the original Super NES version. This 3 disc soundtrack contains additional tracks that were not included on the original release, {{as well as a}} bonus DVD.|$|E
5|$|Chrono <b>Trigger</b> was a {{critical}} and commercial success upon release, and is frequently cited {{as one of the}} best video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono <b>Trigger</b> as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics. Chrono <b>Trigger</b> was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PlayStation iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003. The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009. Chrono <b>Trigger</b> was also ported to i-mode mobile phones, Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS devices, and Android devices.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a <b>trigger</b> mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the <b>trigger.</b> The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage <b>trigger</b> operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the <b>trigger</b> back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the <b>trigger</b> fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
30|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this project}} was to {{establish}} if there are {{significant differences between the}} <b>Triggers</b> which predicted VAPs (VAP <b>triggers)</b> as opposed to <b>triggers</b> which did not predict a VAP (Non VAP <b>triggers)</b> where both groups had <b>triggered</b> an alert.|$|R
50|$|<b>Triggers</b> {{are fully}} {{supported}} {{and can be}} attached to tables. <b>Triggers</b> can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE <b>triggers</b> can target specific columns of a table, and <b>triggers</b> can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the <b>trigger's</b> WHERE clause. <b>Triggers</b> can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple <b>triggers</b> are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, <b>triggers</b> can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.|$|R
30|$|It is {{remarkable}} that P-wave <b>triggering</b> {{was found in}} regions where NVT has been observed <b>triggered</b> by the passage of surface waves. If the <b>triggered</b> event in western Shikoku {{is related to the}} NVT, P-wave <b>triggering</b> {{is the beginning of the}} <b>triggering</b> sequence of NVT. The <b>triggering</b> strain due to P-waves is of the order of 10 − 8, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the <b>triggering</b> strain found for surface-wave <b>triggering.</b> Miyazawa and Brodsky (2008) observed clear surface-wave <b>triggering</b> when the normal strain changes are at least of the order of 10 − 8. In the present method, the epicenter of the <b>triggered</b> events is not well resolved and the depth is not determined, however, the region with a high spectral ratio in western Shikoku corresponds to the locations of <b>triggered</b> NVT during surface-wave arrivals.|$|R
5|$|The game {{took the}} form of a ROM hack of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Chrono <b>Trigger.</b> It was coded using Chrono <b>Trigger</b> ROM editing software, and was meant to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The {{finished}} game was intended to be released as a patch file in the IPS (International Patching System) format, so as to avoid illegal distribution of a full Chrono <b>Trigger</b> ROM.|$|E

5|$|A {{version of}} the album was re-published by Tokyopop in North America as Chrono <b>Trigger</b> Official Soundtrack: Music From Final Fantasy Chronicles on August 21, 2001, to {{coincide}} with the release of the Final Fantasy Chronicles collection of Final Fantasy IV and Chrono <b>Trigger.</b> The first 21 tracks of the album out of 25 were identical to Chrono <b>Trigger</b> Original Soundtrack, while the next three tracks corresponded to tracks 22, 23, and 29 of the Original Soundtrack and the final track was the same as the first track of Brink of Time.

40|$|Dynamic <b>triggering</b> of {{earthquakes}} is {{investigated and}} compared among three geothermal/volcanic regions of California, and dynamic <b>triggering</b> of tremor is investigated and compared among several strike-slip faults in the Western Hemisphere. The {{characteristics of the}} <b>triggering</b> waves - amplitude, frequency, and incidence of the <b>triggering</b> waves on faults – are explored. Results indicate that for earthquake <b>triggering,</b> peak dynamic stress (amplitude) {{appears to be the}} primary controlling factor. On the other hand, tremor <b>triggering</b> is controlled by amplitude, frequency, and incidence of the seismic waves on the fault. In addition, earthquake <b>triggering</b> primarily occurs in geothermal regions with extensional tectonics, while tremor <b>triggering</b> occurs predominately in compressional or transpressional tectonic environments. A geothermal region’s susceptibility to <b>triggering</b> by external stressing is found to be proportional to its background activity rate. However, tremor <b>triggering</b> appears to occur more often than earthquake <b>triggering.</b> The observation that tremor is <b>triggered</b> more often than earthquakes could be a reflection of a fault being weaker at depth (where tremor occurs) than in the shallower crust (where earthquakes occur). That is, tremor may be more easily <b>triggered</b> due to a fault having low effective stress, pressurized fluids, and/or a perpetual state of near-criticality at depths where tremor occurs. Potential research directions that further explore dynamic <b>triggering</b> of earthquakes and tremor are discussed. Ph. D...|$|R
30|$|Large-amplitude {{surface waves}} from the 2011 Tohoku-Oki {{earthquake}} <b>triggered</b> many seismic events across Japan, while the smaller amplitude P-wave <b>triggering</b> remains unclear. A spectral method {{was used to}} detect seismic events <b>triggered</b> by the first arriving P-waves over Japan. This method uses a reference event to correct for source and propagation effects, so that the local response near the station can be examined in detail. P-wave <b>triggering</b> {{was found in the}} regions where <b>triggered</b> non-volcanic tremor (NVT) has been observed, and some seismic and volcanic regions. The <b>triggering</b> strain due to P-waves is of the order of 10 − 8 to 10 − 7, which is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the <b>triggering</b> strain necessary for the surface wave <b>triggering.</b> In the regions of NVT, the <b>triggered</b> event was not identified with slow events, but with other seismic events such as tectonic earthquakes. The sequence of <b>triggering</b> in the regions started with P-wave arrivals. The subsequent surface waves contributed to <b>triggering</b> of NVT, possibly together with slow slip, which resulted in the large amplitude of the NVT.|$|R

5|$|Chrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, {{and themes}} from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono <b>Trigger</b> {{released}} in Japan. An illustrated text adventure, Radical Dreamers {{was created to}} wrap up an unresolved plot line of Chrono <b>Trigger.</b> Though it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross is not a remake of Radical Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable. To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension. A notable {{difference between the two}} games is that Magus—present in Radical Dreamers as Gil—is absent from Chrono Cross. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties. In the DS version of Chrono <b>Trigger,</b> Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.|$|E

50|$|Hemiplegic attacks can {{be brought}} on by {{particular}} <b>triggers,</b> and management of AHC often centers around avoiding common or known <b>triggers.</b> While <b>triggers</b> vary greatly from person to person, {{there are also some}} common ones which are prevalent in many patients. Common <b>triggers</b> include temperature changes, water exposure, bright lights, certain foods, emotional stress, and physical activity. While avoiding <b>triggers</b> may help, it cannot prevent all hemiplegic episodes because many occur without being <b>triggered.</b> Because attacks and other associated symptoms end with sleep, various sedatives can be used to help patients sleep.|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{distributed}} embedded hard real-time systems {{there is}} an ongoing trend to move from traditional event <b>triggered</b> systems to time <b>triggered</b> systems, mainly driven by the unpredictability of communication media like CAN. However, many systems do not fit into this strict periodic framework due to sporadic <b>triggering</b> of tasks. Therefore, on task level {{it is common to}} mix event and time <b>triggered</b> systems, supported by a mixed real-time operating system. This mixed application cause problems in the verification of complex time properties, because traditional timing analysis over-approximates the time consumed by the time <b>triggered</b> parts. In this paper we present an analysis method for the event <b>triggered</b> part of mixed event <b>triggered</b> and time <b>triggered</b> systems. An accurate response time calculation investigates all necessary critical instants and we show the benefit of this analysis in comparison to the traditional calculation scheme. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of this method in order to calculate the response time of event <b>triggered</b> messages on time <b>triggered</b> or mixed bus systems, like FlexRay or TTCAN. ...|$|R

To achieve this, our algorithm splits the initial <b>triggering</b> graph in several <b>triggering</b> graphs. New termination situations can so be discovered. ...|$|R

5|$|The Chrono {{series is}} {{a video game}} {{franchise}} developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square). It began in 1995 with the time travel role-playing video game Chrono <b>Trigger,</b> which spawned two continuations, Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross. The music of Chrono <b>Trigger</b> was mainly composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, with a few tracks composed by regular Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. The Chrono <b>Trigger</b> soundtrack has inspired four official album releases by Square Enix: a soundtrack album in released by NTT Publishing in 1995 and re-released in 2004, a greatest hits album published by DigiCube in 1999, published in abbreviated form by Tokyopop in 2001, and republished by Square Enix in 2005, an acid jazz arrangement album published and republished by NTT Publishing in 1995 and 2004, and a 2008 orchestral arranged album by Square Enix. Corresponding with the Nintendo DS release of the game, a reissued soundtrack was released in 2009. An arranged album for Chrono <b>Trigger</b> and Chrono Cross, entitled To Far Away Times, was released in 2015 to commemorate the 20 year anniversary of Chrono <b>Trigger.</b>|$|E
