40|$|Plasmodesmata linking <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap {{and root}} in primary roots Zea mays are {{restricted}} to approx. 400 protodermal cells bordering approx. 110000 microns 2 of the calyptrogen of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap. This area is less than 10 % of the cross-sectional area of the root-tip at the cap junction. Therefore, gravitropic effectors moving from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap to <b>the</b> <b>root</b> can move symplastically only through a relatively small area in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>root.</b> Decapped roots are non-responsive to gravity. However, decapped roots whose caps are replaced immediately after decapping are strongly graviresponsive. Thus, gravicurvature occurs only when <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap contacts <b>the</b> <b>root,</b> and symplastic continuity between <b>the</b> cap and <b>root</b> is not required for gravicurvature. Completely removing mucilage from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> tip renders <b>the</b> <b>root</b> non-responsive to gravity.

50|$|Regardless {{of whether}} a chord is in root {{position}} or in an inversion, <b>the</b> <b>root</b> remains <b>the</b> same in all three cases.

After a delay of several minutes, acropetally oriented current was also found flowing along the upper side of the meristematic zone. The apparent density of the acropetal current in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap region increased and then decreased with time.

Failure to include <b>the</b> <b>root</b> means that <b>the</b> indicated chord may be hard to hear for some listeners.

50|$|Another method {{with this}} style is the Dandelin-Gräffe method (sometimes also {{ascribed}} to Lobachevsky), which uses polynomial transformations to repeatedly and implicitly square <b>the</b> <b>roots.</b> This greatly magnifies variances in <b>the</b> <b>roots.</b> Applying Viète's formulas, one obtains easy approximations for the modulus of <b>the</b> <b>roots,</b> {{and with some}} more effort, for <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> themselves.|$|R

40|$|Two {{functionally}} distinct sets of meristematic cells {{exist within}} root tips of pea (Pisum sativum) : <b>the</b> <b>root</b> apical meristem, which {{gives rise to}} the body of the root; and <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem, which gives rise to cells that differentiate progressively through the cap and separate ultimately from its periphery as border cells. When a specific number of border cells has accumulated on <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap periphery, mitosis within <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem, but not the apical meristem, is suppressed. When border cells are removed by immersion of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> tip in water, a transient induction of mitosis in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem can be detected starting within 5 min. A corresponding switch in gene expression throughout <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap occurs in parallel with the increase in mitosis, and new border cells begin to separate from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap periphery within 1 h. The induction of renewed border cell production is inhibited by incubating root tips in extracellular material released from border cells.

50|$|Nodules are growths on <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of {{leguminous plants}} where the {{bacteria}} reside. <b>The</b> plant <b>roots</b> secrete amino acids and sugars into the rhizosphere.

The expression of these genes results {{in the production of}} enzymes called nod factors that initiate root hair curling. During this process, the rhizobia are curled up with <b>the</b> <b>root</b> hair. <b>The</b> rhizobia penetrate <b>the</b> <b>root</b> hair cells with an infection thread that grows through <b>the</b> <b>root</b> hair into <b>the</b> main <b>root.</b> This causes <b>the</b> infected cells to divide and form a nodule.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>root</b> {{of a word}} is unit {{of meaning}} (morpheme) and, as such, it is an abstraction, though it can usually be {{represented}} in writing as a word would be.
