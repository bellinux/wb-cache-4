25|$|In the {{cytoplasm}} of {{the recipient}} cell, the <b>T-DNA</b> complex becomes coated with VirE2 proteins, which are exported through the T4SS independently from the <b>T-DNA</b> complex.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{localization}} signals, or NLSs, {{located on}} the VirE2 and VirD2, are recognised by the importin alpha protein, which then associates with importin beta and the nuclear pore complex to transfer the <b>T-DNA</b> into the nucleus. VIP1 {{also appears to be}} an important protein in the process, possibly acting as an adapter to bring the VirE2 to the importin. Once inside the nucleus, VIP2 may target the <b>T-DNA</b> to areas of chromatin that are being actively transcribed, so that the <b>T-DNA</b> can integrate into the host genome.|$|E
25|$|To be virulent, the {{bacterium}} must contain a tumour-inducing plasmid (Ti plasmid or pTi), of 200 kb, which contains the <b>T-DNA</b> {{and all the}} genes necessary to transfer it to the plant cell. Many strains of A. tumefaciens do not contain a pTi.|$|E
25|$|To {{transfer}} the <b>T-DNA</b> into the plant cell, A. tumefaciens uses a type IV secretion mechanism, involving {{the production of}} a T-pilus. When acetosyringone and other substances are detected, a signal transduction event activates the expression of 11 genes within the VirB operon which are responsible for the formation of the T-pilus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>T-DNA</b> must be {{cut out of}} the {{circular}} plasmid. A VirD1/D2 complex nicks the DNA at the left and right border sequences. The VirD2 protein is covalently attached to the 5' end. VirD2 contains a motif that leads to the nucleoprotein complex being targeted to the type IV secretion system (T4SS).|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this <b>T-DNA</b> to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial <b>T-DNA</b> {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called <b>T-DNA)</b> is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} <b>T-DNA</b> at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the <b>T-DNA</b> is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the <b>T-DNA,</b> the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E
25|$|To cause gall formation, the <b>T-DNA</b> encodes {{genes for}} the {{production}} of auxin or indole-3-acetic acid via the IAM pathway. This biosynthetic pathway is not used in many plants {{for the production}} of auxin, so it means the plant has no molecular means of regulating it and auxin will be produced constitutively. Genes {{for the production of}} cytokinins are also expressed. This stimulates cell proliferation and gall formation.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens (updated {{scientific}} name Rhizobium radiobacter, synonym Agrobacterium radiobacter) is the causal agent of {{crown gall disease}} (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the <b>T-DNA,</b> for 'transfer DNA', {{not to be confused}} with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis, confusingly also called transfer RNA), from a plasmid, into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome.|$|E
25|$|A. tumefaciens infects {{the plant}} through its Ti plasmid. The Ti plasmid {{integrates}} {{a segment of}} its DNA, known as <b>T-DNA,</b> into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. A. tumefaciens has flagella that allow it to swim through the soil towards photoassimilates that accumulate in the rhizosphere around roots. Some strains may chemotactically move towards chemical exudates from plants, such as acetosyringone and sugars. The former is recognised by the VirA protein, a transmembrane protein encoded in the virA gene on the Ti plasmid. Sugars are recognised by the chvE protein, a chromosomal gene-encoded protein located in the periplasmic space.|$|E
25|$|The recent spurt in {{information}} on various plant-related processes {{has largely been}} {{a result of the}} revolution in molecular biology. Powerful techniques like mutagenesis and complementation were made possible in Arabidopsis thaliana via generation of <b>T-DNA</b> containing mutant lines, recombinant plasmids, techniques like transposon tagging etc. Availability of complete physical and genetic maps, RNAi vectors, and rapid transformation protocols are some of the technologies that have significantly altered the scope of the field. Recently, there has also been a massive increase in the genome and EST sequences of various non-model species, which, coupled with the bioinformatics tools existing today, generate opportunities in the field of plant evo-devo research.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live {{predominantly}} saprophytic lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid <b>T-DNA</b> in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|E
2500|$|The DNA {{transmission}} {{capabilities of}} Agrobacterium have been vastly explored in biotechnology {{as a means}} of inserting foreign genes into plants. Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, (University of Ghent and Plant Genetic Systems, Belgium) discovered the gene transfer mechanism between Agrobacterium and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter the bacterium into an efficient delivery system for genetic engineering in plants. The plasmid <b>T-DNA</b> that is transferred to the plant is an ideal vehicle for genetic engineering. [...] This is done by cloning a desired gene sequence into the <b>T-DNA</b> that will be inserted into the host DNA. [...] This process has been performed using firefly luciferase gene to produce glowing plants. [...] This luminescence has been a useful device in the study of plant chloroplast function and as a reporter gene. It is also possible to transform Arabidopsis thaliana by dipping flowers into a broth of Agrobacterium: the seed produced will be transgenic. Under laboratory conditions, the <b>T-DNA</b> has also been transferred to human cells, demonstrating the diversity of insertion application.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>T-DNA</b> {{contains}} {{genes for}} encoding enzymes {{that cause the}} plant to create specialized amino acid derivatives which the bacteria can metabolize, called opines. [...] Opines are a class of chemicals that serve {{as a source of}} nitrogen for A. tumefaciens, but not for most other organisms. [...] The specific type of opine produced by A. tumefaciens C58 infected plants is nopaline (Escobar et al., 2003).|$|E
2500|$|The A. thaliana gene {{knockout}} collections are a unique resource for plant biology {{made possible by}} the availability of high-throughput transformation and funding for genomics resources. [...] The site of <b>T-DNA</b> insertions has been determined for over 300,000 independent transgenic lines, with the information and seeds accessible through online [...] [...] Through these collections, insertional mutants are available for most genes in A. thaliana.|$|E

50|$|Systems {{in which}} <b>T-DNA</b> and vir genes {{are located on}} {{separate}} replicons are called <b>T-DNA</b> binary systems. <b>T-DNA</b> {{is located on the}} binary vector (the non-T-DNA region of this vector containing origin(s) of replication that could function both in E. coli and in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and antibiotic-resistance genes used to select for the presenceof the binary vector in bacteria, became known as vector backbone sequences). The replicon containing the vir genes became known as the vir helper. Strains harboring this replicon and a <b>T-DNA</b> are considered disarmed if they do not contain oncogenes that could be transferred to a plant.|$|E
50|$|The {{transfer}} DNA (abbreviated <b>T-DNA)</b> is the transferred DNA of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of {{some species}} of bacteria such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The <b>T-DNA</b> {{is transferred from}} bacterium into the host plant's nuclear DNA genome. The <b>T-DNA</b> is bordered by 25-base-pair repeats on each end. Transfer is initiated at the right border and terminated at the left border and requires the vir genes of the Ti plasmid.|$|E

50|$|The <b>T-DNA</b> {{portion of}} the binary plasmid is flanked by left and right border {{sequences}} and consists of a transgene {{as well as a}} plant selectable marker (PSM). Outside of the <b>T-DNA,</b> the binary plasmid also contains a bacterial selectable marker (BSM) and an origin of replication (ori) for bacteria.|$|E

50|$|In Agrobacterium-mediated recombination, the plasmid {{construct}} {{must also}} contain <b>T-DNA.</b> Agrobacterium naturally inserts DNA from a tumor-inducing plasmid into any susceptible plant that it infects, causing crown gall disease. The <b>T-DNA</b> region of this plasmid {{is responsible for}} insertion of the DNA. The DNA to be inserted is cloned into a binary vector that contains <b>T-DNA</b> and can be grown in both E. coli and Agrobacterium. Once the binary vector is constructed the plasmid is transformed into Agrobacterium containing no plasmids and plant cells are infected. The Agrobacterium naturally inserts the genetic material into the plant cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{integrating}} the <b>T-DNA</b> into a host genome is {{the formation of a}} nick at the right border of the Ti plasmid. This nick creates a region of single stranded DNA from the left border of the <b>T-DNA</b> gene over to the right border which was cut. Single stranded binding proteins then attach to the single stranded DNA. DNA synthesis will displace the single stranded region and then a second nick at the left border region will release the single stranded <b>T-DNA</b> fragment. This fragment can then be incorporated into a host genome.|$|E
50|$|The same {{procedure}} of <b>T-DNA</b> transfer {{can be used}} to disrupt genes via insertional mutagenesis. Not only does the inserted <b>T-DNA</b> sequence create a mutation but it also 'tags' the affected gene, thus allowing for its isolation. This method is used widely to study gene function in plants, such as the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.|$|E

50|$|Agrobacterium-mediated <b>T-DNA</b> {{transfer}} {{is widely used}} as a tool in biotechnology. In genetic engineering, the tumor-promoting and opine-synthesis genes are removed from the <b>T-DNA</b> and replaced with a gene of interest and/or a selection marker, which is required to establish which plants have been successfully transformed. Examples of selection markers include neomycin phosphotransferase, hygromycin B phosphotransferase (which both phosphorylate antibiotics) and phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (which acetylates and deactivates phosphinothricin, a potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase). Agrobacterium is then used as a vector to transfer the engineered <b>T-DNA</b> into the plant cells where it integrates into the plant genome.

50|$|The Ti plasmid is {{responsible}} for transmission of crown gall disease in plants infected with A. vitis. Tumorigenic A. vitis transfers its Ti plasmid to other bacteria, and transfers <b>T-DNA</b> into plants. Virulence genes encoded by the Ti plasmid generate single-strand <b>T-DNA</b> molecules, which in turn are transferred to healthy hosts. Disorganized cell division occurs in infected hosts, leading to gall development instead {{of the formation of}} healthy vascular tissue.|$|E

50|$|Das {{has worked}} on {{establishment}} of efficient plant regeneration and transformation protocol for mustard, chickpea and pigeonpea. Other areas of interest are construction {{of a number of}} vectors with different <b>T-DNA</b> border elements for a better understanding of mechanism of <b>T-DNA</b> integration into host plant and construction of chimeric Bt, protease inhibitor gene (s) and other agronomically important gene(s) constructs for their expression in important crops namely, rice and mustard for increased productivity.|$|E
50|$|The plasmid <b>T-DNA</b> is {{integrated}} semi-randomly into the genome {{of the host}} cell, and the tumor morphology genes on the <b>T-DNA</b> are expressed, causing {{the formation of a}} gall. The <b>T-DNA</b> carries genes for the biosynthetic enzymes for the production of unusual amino acids, typically octopine or nopaline. It also carries genes for the biosynthesis of the plant hormones, auxin and cytokinins, and for the biosynthesis of opines, providing a carbon and nitrogen source for the bacteria that most other micro-organisms can't use, giving Agrobacterium a selective advantage. By altering the hormone balance in the plant cell, the division of those cells cannot be controlled by the plant, and tumors form. The ratio of auxin to cytokinin produced by the tumor genes determines the morphology of the tumor (root-like, disorganized or shoot-like).|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} Agrobacterium to {{transfer}} genes to plants and fungi {{is used in}} biotechnology, in particular, genetic engineering for plant improvement. A modified Ti or Ri plasmid can be used. The plasmid is 'disarmed' by deletion of the tumor inducing genes; the only essential parts of the <b>T-DNA</b> are its two small (25 base pair) border repeats, {{at least one of}} which is needed for plant transformation. The genes to be introduced into the plant are cloned into a plant transformation vector that contains the <b>T-DNA</b> region of the disarmed plasmid, together with a selectable marker (such as antibiotic resistance) to enable selection for plants that have been successfully transformed. Plants are grown on media containing antibiotic following transformation, and those that do not have the <b>T-DNA</b> integrated into their genome will die. An alternative method is agroinfiltration.|$|E
