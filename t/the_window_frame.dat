5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; the stained glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s Riverside High school, {{like many}} older urban schools, {{was in a}} state of rapid decay. The windows leaked water and snow, and the building's heating system was unable to keep the staff and {{students}} warm. Nearly all aspects of the building were in disrepair. It was decided that a second addition and a renovation were in order. After a careful review, the building was retrofitted with new Plexiglass windows. Unfortunately the new windows yellowed over time and blocked much of the sunlight, as well as covered most of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|The window {{treatments}} {{were another}} area of disagreement between du Pont and Boudin. Du Pont wanted the window treatments inside <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame,</b> to expose the moldings. Boudin felt this made the room appear too tall. After the two discussed the issue in early 1961, du Pont's view won out. But in late 1962, Boudin removed these window treatments and implemented one he had used many times before in many different homes: Straight panels to hide the side moldings, with a Baroque Revival flat panel to cover the top molding and rods. The fabric used was the same Boudin had selected for the wall covering, but trimmed with a French-made decorative silver tape.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> {{have been}} {{replaced}} with aluminium and the ground floor facade has been painted cream.|$|R
50|$|The roof of {{the tower}} and the dome above the altar are painted white, as are <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> on <b>the</b> upper section of the tower.|$|R
25|$|Deep-set {{windows in}} {{rectilinear}} shapes, a Breuer trademark, were planned for <b>the</b> facade. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> {{were made of}} precast concrete. The building was the first Breuer-designed structure in the United States to use a precast concrete facade, {{and this was the}} first federal building to be built of precast concrete. The facade was designed to be load-bearing, with the panels on the second, third, and fourth floors designed to carry the weight of <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> on <b>the</b> eighth, ninth, and tenth floors were slightly thinner, because although they were not load-bearing they had to contain HVAC piping. The panels on the middle floors required the least amount of fabrication, according to architect Herbert Beckhard (an associate in Breuer's firm who helped design the building), as they did not need to bear as much load nor contain much piping. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> do not meet {{at the corner of the}} concrete frame. Pipes from the I-395 tunnel (which runs below the building) run up through the building's walls and vent at the corners of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> dispersing automobile exhaust fumes high in the air. Each concrete unit is three feet (0.9 metres) thick and weighs almost 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes). The firm which supplied <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> had no previous experience producing architectural concrete, but instead had supplied precast forms for bridges and parking garages.|$|R
25|$|On 7 January, they {{constructed}} a raft from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> of a house; {{after two days}} of drifting on the raft they were swept out to sea on the morning of 9 January, where Cdr. Bridgeman, who was not a strong swimmer, died of exhaustion and exposure. Moon tried to keep Bridgman on the raft but he slipped off into the sea. After Moon had been on the raft for some thirteen hours the tide turned and the raft was thrown onto the shore. Moon was rescued by natives who handed him over to the Germans, who interred him in a prisoner of war camp. He was released from captivity on 21 November 1917.|$|E
25|$|The first shell {{exploded}} in the garden, causing the officers at the meeting {{to go to the}} windows of the garden room to see the fall of the shell. Thus they were in the worst possible position for the second shell which exploded right in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> of the room. The explosion killed six officers and mortally wounded two others. The third shell impacted an empty part of the house, although the owner, Baron de Vinck, narrowly escaped injury. Monro had stepped into another room for a conference with his Chief of Staff and so survived with minor injuries, but Lomax was seriously wounded and evacuated back to England, being placed in a nursing home in London where he received palliative care for the next five months.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{warnings}} of their intelligence officers, the security chiefs were caught completely by surprise. The RLI headquarters {{and all three}} Commandos were deployed in the Zambezi valley on routine border-control duty, and Support Group was at Cranborne Barracks. A troop of Support Group men under Second Lieutenant Ian Buttenshaw was despatched to Centenary the next day along with a troop of SAS, led by Bert Sachse. In their preliminary sweep around Altena Farm they discovered a land mine planted in the road, but no insurgents. While the security forces were patrolling around Altena, Nhongo's men approached Whistlefield Farm in the late evening of 22 December and, as at Altena, attacked the farm house with rifle fire, grenades and an RPG-7 rocket launcher, which was aimed into the bedroom in which de Borchgrave was sleeping. The rocket hit <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> and lightly wounded the tobacco farmer and his nine-year-old daughter Anne. The ZANLA cadres then retreated and hid themselves. News of the second attack reached Buttenshaw and Sachse around midnight, and they deployed immediately, but having discovered a mine near Altena they disembarked from the vehicles [...] from Whistlefield and made the final approach on foot. Anne was evacuated by helicopter as the RLI and SAS men secured the area for the night.|$|E
5000|$|A fire-sport {{tower and}} a ladder with hooks are needed. The {{goal is to}} reach the fourth floor by hooking <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> of <b>the</b> tower. The most {{challenging}} event.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{suburban}} electric passenger fleet, the cars were painted all-over crimson with a black underframe and moonstone grey along <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> This later changed to moonstone grey only on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> and eventually <b>the</b> grey was removed altogether.|$|R
50|$|Rectangular in form, {{the church}} is built from Pennant {{sandstone}} with a slate roof and an octagonal bellcote. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> in <b>the</b> north and south walls are of red Cheshire sandstone and probably date from 1883.|$|R
500|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy {{was better}} received. Bob Mackey at USgamer {{appreciated}} how {{the games were}} mostly left untouched, while getting minor improvements, {{such as the ability}} to read the text at the player's own pace rather than waiting for it to [...] "slowly [...] across the screen". He said that the game's graphical upgrades were hit or miss, with certain characters, including Phoenix and Edgeworth, looking great, while elements that originally had less definition, such as the judge's beard, were [...] "a little wonky". Thomas Whitehead at Nintendo Life said that Capcom had done a [...] "solid job" [...] with the port, and appreciated the stereoscopic 3D effect and the game's faithfulness to the original; he, however, felt that the lack of an orchestral soundtrack similar to that in [...] was a minor disappointment. Geoff Thew at Hardcore Gamer called the updated art gorgeous, and noted that it did not have the same animation-related problems as the Trilogy HD on iOS. He appreciated the 3D effect, which he said works well most of the time, but said that <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> in the detention center was not rendered on its own layer; he said {{that it was not a}} huge problem, but that it was distracting as the player visits that area often. He also commented on the lack of a remastered soundtrack, calling it a letdown.|$|E
2500|$|According to one author [...] "The {{painting}} is often referenced for its immaculate depiction of non-Euclidean geometry", {{referring to the}} image on the convex mirror. Assuming a spherical mirror, the distortion has been correctly portrayed, except for the leftmost part of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame,</b> the near edge of the table and the hem of the dress.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Windows Aero visual style, Windows Vista Home Basic exclusively includes a [...] "Windows Vista Standard" [...] theme which has the same hardware requirements as [...] "Windows Aero", and therefore uses Desktop Window Manager for desktop composition, but {{does not include the}} ability to generate live thumbnails of running applications, nor does it allow transparency of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> As a result, 3D effects and other features associated with live thumbnails are not included with this theme.|$|E
5000|$|Take the {{invention}} of a patented <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> It is now the law that the seller of the frame may stipulate that no other material shall {{be used in a}} house in which <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> are placed except such as may be bought from the patentee and seller of the frame.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{not going}} in for style," [...] {{declared}} Earl. [...] "You can get <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> and glass, {{and the door}} and the finishing boards, and we'll get out the rest, won't we, Randy?" [...] And his brother agreed with him.|$|R
50|$|A {{sporting}} model, the Sigma GSR, {{was also}} released with either 2.0 or 2.6-litre engines offered with either automatic or manual transmissions. Features included alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a sports {{steering wheel and}} blackouts, particularly on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> and doorhandles.|$|R
2500|$|In 1961 Citroën {{launched}} a new model based on the 2CV chassis, with a four-door sedan body, and a reverse rake rear window: the Citroën Ami. In 1962 the engine power was increased to 14hp and top speed to [...] A sun roof was installed. In 1963 the engine power was increased to 16hp. An electric wiper motor replaced the drive on the speedo. The ammeter {{was replaced by a}} charging indicator light. The speedometer was moved from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> into the dash. Instead of a dip stick/measuring rod, a fuel gauge was introduced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first one}} is a conical stele made of red granite, {{discovered}} in 1909 {{on the island of}} Elephantine. The object is [...] long, [...] thick and [...] broad. Its shape resembles a typical Benben stele, as known from mastaba tombs of early dynastic kings. At the front, the cone presents a rectangular niche with an incarved inscription inside. The inscription mentions a royal palace named Palace of the headband of Huni and writes Huni's name above inside a royal cartouche. The decorated niche is interpreted by scholars as a so-called [...] "apparition window". The lower part of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> is flattened and elongated and shows traces of a second inscription, apparently the same as inside the window. It is not fully clarified, where exactly the object was once on display. Because it was found very close to a stepped pyramid, Egyptologists such as Rainer Stadelmann propose a position on the very front of the monument, or even visibly embedded in one of the steps. Today Huni's dedication cone is on display in the Cairo Museum as object JE 41556.|$|E

50|$|Kokoshniks {{were used}} in the Russian church {{architecture}} from the 16th century, and they were especially popular in the 17th century. They were placed on walls, at the basement of tented roofs or tholobates, over <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> or in rows above the vaults.|$|R
50|$|The west {{elevation}} is a rendered {{masonry wall}} with little decoration. It {{consists of a}} central service door flanked on each side by two windows. Decorative treatments similar to the front elevation are used including the moulded capping {{to the wall and}} around <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b> Small hooded vents are set into the wall above each of <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} were frescoed in 1549 by Nicolo dell'Abate. The exterior fresco work by Girolamo da Treviso and Prospero Fontana {{has long}} decayed. In 1732, the palace was refurbished by Alfonso Torreggiani for the Princesses Benedetta and Amalia d'Este of Modena. His contribution is noted in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> of <b>the</b> piano nobile.|$|R
60|$|Sam ran to {{the closet}} and found the rope just {{where it had been}} left, on a hook in the corner. Soon they had it out and {{fastened}} to a bed-slat braced across <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
60|$|The mother's head {{appeared}} at the bedroom window. She slid the sash back, and craned out, vainly trying {{to look over the}} gutter below the slates. She was even more dishevelled than usual, and the tears had dried on her pale face. She stretched further out, clinging to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> and to the gutter overhead, till I was afraid she would come down with a crash.|$|E
60|$|Fortune had favored his {{undertaking}} by decreeing that a stout drainpipe should pass up {{the wall}} within {{a few inches of}} his and Psmith's study. On the first day of term, it may be remembered he had wrenched away the wooden bar which bisected <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame,</b> thus rendering exit and entrance almost as simple as they had been for Wyatt during Mike's first term at Wrykyn.|$|E
5000|$|The Sovereign model came {{equipped}} with significantly more features than the base XJ6. Included was air conditioning, headlamp washers, a six-speaker sound system, rear self-levelling suspension (SLS), anti-lock braking system, and inlaid burl walnut wood trim (pre-MY1991). The headlamps fitted were the rectangular single units. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> {{were made from}} stainless steel ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{thanked him}} with {{her eyes as she}} sank into the chair he wheeled out so that the light left her face in shadow. Geoffrey stood near <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>framing</b> and he did not look {{directly}} towards her. Helen appreciated the consideration which prompted the action and the respect implied by his attitude.|$|R
50|$|Designed in the Neoclassical style, Eriksholm {{is built}} in white-washed brick and {{consists}} of three wings under a black-glazed tile roof. The semicircular buildings which connect the main wings to the lower and short lateral wings are typical of the contemporary English Palladianism. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> and portals are made of sandstone from Bornholm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now is my chance!" [...] he muttered, {{and without}} {{stopping}} {{to think twice}} he rammed the window bars {{as hard as he}} could with the bench. A second and third blow followed, and down went the irons, carrying a portion of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> with them. Then through the opening leaped the young captain. As he landed in the courtyard, he picked up a small log of wood lying handy.|$|E
6000|$|A quiver {{ran through}} {{her as she}} leaned upon <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> There was a certain pathos in the simple strain, and she could fancy that the lad, who was clearly English, as an exile felt it, too. Once more as the jaded horses and clashing machine grew smaller down {{the edge of the}} great sweep of yellow grain, his voice came faintly up to her with its {{haunting}} thrill of longing and regret-- ...|$|E
60|$|After I {{had done}} that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I do not know. The window of my study looks over {{the trees and the}} railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our {{departure}} this window had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> enclosed, the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the church is unique in that it {{incorporates}} ideas from both English and Māori church design. The fenestration and flooring were done by English carpenters. [...] A carpenter named Edward Prince, who had arrived in Wellington in 1841, was employed in making <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> as well as some other unspecified work.|$|R
50|$|After the {{adoption}} of Rail Blue with full yellow ends in 1966 (D1048 {{was the first of}} the class painted in this livery in 1966), for some unexplained reason a small batch of locos (D1017, D1030, D1036, D1037, D1043, D1047 and D1057) received this variant married to small yellow warning panels, D1030 even carried red buffer beams for a short while. All other repaints were with full yellow ends which extended from the body line above the buffer beam up to the base of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> along <b>the</b> sill of <b>the</b> cab-side <b>windows</b> onto <b>the</b> vertical end reveal. The valance above <b>the</b> cab <b>windows</b> on <b>the</b> front was also painted yellow, leaving <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> in their base aluminium. The drive to repaint the locomotives in Rail Blue was outstripped by the safety directive dictating full yellow ends for all powered vehicles and some locomotives ran for a time with their original maroon bodies and full yellow ends.|$|R
50|$|As an example, when {{a picture}} is taken indoors, the {{brightness}} of outdoor objects seen through a window may be 70 or 80 times brighter than objects inside the room. If exposure levels are set for objects inside the room, the bright image of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> will bleed past <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> when convolved with the Airy disc of the camera being used to produce the image.|$|R
