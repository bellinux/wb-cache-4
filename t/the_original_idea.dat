5|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea,</b> {{known as}} The Un-Natural World was {{of an urban}} fox living in Brixton called Nelson, who was so used to {{living in the city}} that he had lost any sense of being an animal.

5|$|Karim {{said the}} {{inspiration}} for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

5|$|On January 16, 2012, it was {{announced}} that 2007 Black Listed screenwriter Melissa Stack was hired by 20th Century Fox to write an untitled female revenge comedy, which Julie Yorn would produce through LBI Productions.

5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> belonged to Cătălin Mitulescu and Andreei Vălean; {{the only part of the}} original story that was kept is that of a group of boys trying to steal a trolleybus in order to get to some prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for {{the short}} was a magician who {{incorporated}} a rabbit into his act who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> was to {{film the}} opening {{sequence}} in 1.33:1 aspect ratio {{in order to}} simulate the TV screens that were {{available at the time}} of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A.

5|$|This was <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for {{the story}} to open the tenth season. This story took aspects from The Seventh Seal, with the ruler of the Time Lords playing a {{variation}} of Chess with Death, who was leading a Federation of Evil. The three Doctors would get transported to an Underworld-like realm, where they would face such creatures of evil like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was deemed too expensive and not suitable for a family show.|$|E
5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for Herman was for him to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E

5|$|According to Tarkovsky, <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for a {{film about}} the life of Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov {{proposed}} to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs {{on either side of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>idea,</b> Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge. He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E
