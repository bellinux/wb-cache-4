2500|$|Gameplay {{involves}} the player {{being able to}} interact with the environment, and the realistic water dynamics. Rob Hewson stated that [...] "player versus environment is certainly {{a large part of the}} experience, <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> about water is that it is constantly affecting every area of the environment, so you get incredible amounts of emergent behaviour. The player constantly has to adapt to the environment and react quickly because doors, walls and windows are going to cave in differently each time according to the distribution of water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bloomberg {{was asked}} if he was {{satisfied}} that [...] "he is indeed a man of peace given his background where he's supposedly supported Hamas, blamed the U.S. for 9/11 attacks?" [...] The mayor responded: [...] "My job is not to vet clergy in this city.... Everybody has a right to their opinions. You don't have to worship there.... this country is not built around ... only those ... clergy people that we agree with..... It's built around freedom. That's <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> about the First Amendment – you can say anything you want." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> about [...] "Stairway" [...] is {{the fact}} that just about {{everybody}} has got their own individual interpretation to it, and actually what it meant to them at their point of life. And that's what's so great about it. Over the passage of years, you know, people come to me with all manner of stories about, you know, what it meant to them at certain points of their lives. About how it's got them through some really tragic circumstances ... Because it's an extremely positive song, it's such a positive energy, and, you know, people have got married to [...]|$|E

6000|$|Among {{the palms}} of Madame Christophor's conservatory, Julien and Lady Anne were living through a brief new chapter of their history. <b>The</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> had come to them. It was amazing--almost unrealizable! A new glamor enveloped the merest trifles. They spoke in halting sentences, they were at times almost incoherent. The marvel of it was so great! ...|$|E
60|$|It was splendid. It was {{the most}} thrilling game he had ever played; and <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> was that he felt almost all he said. It was only that he exaggerated a little. He was tremendously {{interested}} and excited in the effect {{he could see it}} had on her. It was obviously with an effort that at last she suggested going in.|$|E

He has a natural turn for business, an {{extraordinary}} head. He comes by that," [...] Strether explained, [...] "honestly enough. He's in that respect his father's son, and also--for she's wonderful in her way too--his mother's. He has other tastes and other tendencies; but Mrs. Newsome and your wife are quite right about his having that. He's very remarkable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mind {{taking my}} chances when I {{am on the}} war-path," [...] the Colonel answered. [...] "That's all {{straightforward}} {{and in the way}} of business. But when you have women with you, and a helpless crowd like this, it becomes really dreadful.

"Now," [...] {{said the}} master, [...] "I have taught you {{nearly all of}} the science that I know, and {{the time has come to}} show you <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> that has been waiting for us from the {{beginning}} when time was.

Now, then, comes the last test--whether you can remain faithful to me to the end; if you fail in it, all is lost that you have gained." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How sweet {{it is to}} {{hear you}} say so! And <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> is that you have never seemed disappointed.

60|$|All {{that day}} we rested {{there by the}} water, thanking our stars {{that we had been}} lucky enough to find it, bad as it was, and not forgetting to render a due share of {{gratitude}} to the shade of the long-departed da Silvestra, who had set its position down so accurately on the tail of his shirt. <b>The</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> to us was that the pan should have lasted so long, and the only way in which I can account for this is on the supposition that it is fed by some spring deep down in the sand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there's room enough {{here for}} them, I'm sure," [...] said Dorothy. [...] "Betsy and I are already eager to welcome Trot. It will keep us busy for a year, at least, showing her all <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> in Oz." ...|$|R

60|$|Harold was too {{moved to}} answer, so he {{shouldered}} his last load of treasure and limped off {{with it to}} the house. Mrs. Jobson and her talkative niece were up now, {{but they did not}} happen to see him, and he reached his room unnoticed. He poured the last bagful of gold into the chest, smoothed it down, shut the lid and locked it. Then as he was, covered with filth and grime, bruised and bleeding, his hair flying wildly about his face, he sat down upon it, and from his heart thanked heaven for <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> that had happened to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let's {{hope that}} they don't find out {{anything}} about it," [...] I replied, to change the subject. Then taking Roderick by the hand I led him to where Maqueda stood a yard or two apart, listening to our talk, but, of course, understanding very little of it, and introduced him to her, explaining in a few words <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> that had happened. She welcomed him very kindly, and congratulated me upon my son's escape. Meanwhile, Roderick had been staring at her with evident admiration. Now he turned {{to us and said}} in his quaint broken English: ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> happened. The {{windows of}} the dining room faced the drive to the house and both women could clearly see a motor car turn in at the gate and stop at the front door. It was {{obviously}} a hired car, as the driver was not in livery, but the tall, mulled-up figure in unfamiliar clothes who occupied the front seat was for the moment a mystery to them. Only Helen seemed to have some wonderful premonition of the truth, a premonition which she was afraid to admit even to herself. Her hand began to shake. Philippa looked at her in amazement.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> about Thomas Lynch's Skating With Heather Grace is its mix of accents and settings. In {{his first}} book of poems, Mr. Lynch shows himself a master of Irish-influenced invective, an echo of brogue recalling the days when a poet's curses meant something....|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no {{business}} of mine, no man's less: but I often wonder why you poets don't {{take to the}} microscope, and {{tell us a little}} more about <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> which are here already, and not about those which are not, and which, perhaps, never will be." ...|$|R
50|$|Billy {{was lost}} in the {{wilderness}} at a young age and was raised by Big Horns. When the other cars found him on a camping trip, they brought him back to the City of Auto and learned to see all <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> in their city through new eyes.|$|R
