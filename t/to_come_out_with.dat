5|$|With {{the growing}} Caribbean {{following}} in England, the West Indies entered the series {{as one of}} the most popular touring nations. Lance Gibbs' 11 wickets at Old Trafford set up a commanding 10 wicket win for the West Indies. The second match at Lord's was chiefly remembered for its dramatic ending; all results were possible going into the final over of the match. England required eight runs to win but only had two wickets left. From the fourth ball of the over Derek Shackleton was run out, which meant that Colin Cowdrey had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a broken arm with two balls of the match remaining. He did not have to face a ball, and the match ended in a draw. The third Test saw Fred Trueman claim 12 wickets ensuring England won by 217 runs. Charlie Griffith's 6/36 in the fourth and Conrad Hunte's 108 in the final Test meant the West Indies won the next two Tests and the series finished 3–1. The final Test saw a pitch invasion when Basil Butcher scored the winning runs for the West Indies.|$|E

25|$|By the mid 19th century, {{the wine}} {{industry}} of France enjoyed a golden period of prosperity. A {{new class of}} consumers, the bourgeoisie, emerged as a strong market for wine and other culinary products. The Gironde region of Bordeaux, in particular, enjoyed a swell of interest from both the Parisian market {{as well as its}} steady trade with England. For the 1855 Paris Exposition, Emperor Napoleon III commissioned the Bordeaux merchants <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a ranking of the region's wine estates. The 1855 classification of Bordeaux would become one of the world's most famous rankings of wine estates.

Worcestershire started creditably, snaring the wicket of Robert Croft in the second over, but Glamorgan sent out another pinch-hitter in Alex Wharf who made 38 before he was bowled bu David Leatherdale who took two for 35. However, Sourav Ganguly with 53, Michael Powell with 82, and David Hemp with an unbeaten 51 off 36 balls chased down the target. The Glamorgan batsman took a particular liking to England Test spinner Gareth Batty who finished wicketless for 69 runs.|$|E
25|$|May 27 – The Manila Electric Company {{held its}} tension-filled annual {{stockholders}} meeting, which lasted {{for more than}} 13 hours, making it the longest stockholders' meeting in Philippine corporate history. The {{head of the state}} pension fund Government Service Insurance System Winston Garcia filed a motion to the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend the stockholders' meeting after it questioned the proxy votes in favor of the Lopez family. The MERALCO board proceeded with the company's stockholders' meeting, defying a cease and desist order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission after it questioned the authenticity of the injunction order.

500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience and I guess you don't want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his agent said that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E

500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul. [...] "When It Hurts So Bad" [...] is musically old roots reggae mixed with soul. While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said {{that she did not}} intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When they hit a high note, you actually felt it." ...|$|E

[...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band did {{eventually}} get Rodriguez's {{permission to use}} the original photograph. Since the [...] "morphed" [...] album sleeves were already in production by that time, Serini claimed it would cost the band $2,500 to halt production and reinstate the image intended originally by the band, which forced the band to keep the morphed version.

2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled.

I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise.
