40|$|A new {{specimen}} geometry, the shear-compression specimen (SCS), {{has been}} developed for large strain testing of materials. The specimen consists of a cylinder in which two diametrically opposed slots are machined at 45 ° {{with respect to the}} longitudinal axis, thus forming the <b>test</b> <b>gage</b> section. The specimen was analyzed numerically for two representative material models, and various gage geometries. This study shows that the stress (strain) state in the gage, is three-dimensional rather than simple shear as would be commonly assumed. Yet, the dominant deformation mode in the gage section is shear, and the stresses and strains are rather uniform. Simple relations were developed and assessed to relate the equivalent true stress and equivalent true plastic strain to the applied loads and displacements. The specimen was further validated through experiments carried out on OFHC copper, by comparing results obtained with the SCS to those obtained with compression cylinders. The SCS allows to investigate a large range of strain rates, from the quasi-static regime, through intermediate strain rates (1 – 100 s^(− 1)), up to very high strain rates (2 × 10 ^ 4 s^(− 1) in the present case) ...|$|E

Prior to the deck replacement, a prototype steel orthotropic deck was installed on the main span for a length of 120 feet (36. 6 m). Approximately 300 strain gages were installed at critical locations to investigate the fatigue strength under static and dynamic loads of the AASHTO fatigue truck and under normal traffic.

40|$|Carbon fibres {{and glass}} fibres are {{reinforcements}} for advanced composites and the fiber strength {{is the most}} influential factor {{on the strength of}} the composites. They are essentially brittle and fail with very little reduction in cross section. Composites made with these fibres are characterized by a high strength/density ratio and their properties are intrisically related to their microstructure, i. e., amount and orientation of the fibres, surface treatment, among other factors. Processing parameters have {{an important role in the}} fibre mechanical behaviour (strength and modulus). Cracks, voids and impurities in the case of glass fibres and fibrillar misalignments in the case of carbon fibres are created during processing. Such inhomogeneities give rise to an appreciable scatter in properties. The most used statistical tool that deals with this characteristic variability in properties is the Weibull distribution. The present work investigates the influence of the <b>testing</b> <b>gage</b> length on the strength, Young's modulus and Weibull modulus of carbon fibres and glass fibres. The Young's modulus is calculated by two methods: (i) ASTM D 3379 M, and (ii) interaction between testing equipment/specimen The first method resulted in a Young modulus of 183 GPa for carbon fibre, and 76 GPa for glass fibre. The second method gave a Young modulus of 250 GPa for carbon fibre and 50 GPa for glass fibre. These differences revelead differences on how the interaction specimen/testing machine can interfere in the Young modulus calculations. Weibull modulus can be a tool to evaluate the fibre's homogeneity in terms of properties and it is a good quality control parameter during processing. In the range of specimen <b>gage</b> length <b>tested</b> the Weibull modulus for carbon fibre is ~ 3. 30 and for glass fibres is ~ 5. 65, which indicates that for the batch of fibres tested, the glass fibre is more uniform in properties...|$|R

5000|$|The company {{devised a}} method for {{applying}} strain <b>gage</b> <b>testing</b> to determining the stresses placed on circuit boards by the {{hundreds or thousands of}} test probes used to make electrical contact therewith. [...] This is useful because each test probe (a.k.a. [...] "pogo pin") exerts several ounces of force on the DUT (Device Under Test). When the test fixture has thousands of test probes, the sum of the individual probe forces can reach hundreds of pounds. Such force is sufficient to deform the DUT (a printed circuit board, for example) {{to the point where the}} attached inflexible electronic component packages (such as Ball Grid Arrays) may fracture, or their solder joints may fail. Strain <b>gage</b> <b>testing</b> can reveal areas on the DUT where these net forces are excessive when the DUT is clamped into the test fixture, thus showing where supports must be added to the opposite side of the test fixture to counteract the test probe forces. Where a support counteracts the test probe forces, the test probe force is converted from a deformative force distorting the DUT to a compressive force, squeezing the DUT circuit board without deforming its generally planar shape.|$|R

40|$|Researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center have {{developed}} a unique strain gage and adhesive system for measuring the mechanical properties of polymers and polymer composites at elevated temperatures. This system overcomes {{some of the problems}} encountered in using commercial strain gages and adhesives. For example, typical commercial strain gage adhesives require a postcure at temperatures substantially higher than the maximum test temperature. The exposure of the specimen to this temperature may affect subsequent results, and in some cases may be higher than the glass-transition temperature of the polymer. In addition, although typical commercial strain gages can be used for short times at temperatures up to 370 C, their long-term use is limited to 230 C. This precludes their use for testing some high-temperature polyimides near their maximum temperature capability. Lewis' strain gage and adhesive system consists of a nonencapsulated, unbacked gage grid that is bonded directly to the polymer after the specimen has been cured but prior to the normal postcure cycle. The gage is applied with an adhesive specially formulated to cure under the specimen postcure conditions. Special handling, mounting, and electrical connection procedures were developed, and a fixture was designed to calibrate each strain gage after it was applied to a specimen. A variety of tests was conducted to determine the performance characteristics of the gages at elevated temperatures on PMR- 15 neat resin and titanium specimens. For these tests, which included static tension, thermal exposure, and creep <b>tests,</b> the <b>gage</b> and adhesive system performed within normal strain gage specifications at 315 C.

The measured strains were found to vary strongly with temperature and test speed, spanning the range of 300 to 2, 000 microstrains. The upper range of these values is much larger than was anticipated, and the strains are 2 to 3 times higher than layered elastic computer program predictions of asphalt strain responses for the structural and load conditions existing during the tests. Longer duration of loading results in reduced asphalt stiffness. However, the longer duration of loading at slow speeds increases the amount of viscous flow and leads to significant increases in the total strain within the asphalt mix as speed decreases...|$|R
