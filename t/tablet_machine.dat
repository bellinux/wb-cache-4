In particular, among the six starches, lower viscosity values corresponded to lower PY values, and lower elastic modulus values corresponded to lower elastic recovery of the tablet. Mechanical properties of materials can be better characterized if viscoelastic tests performed under dynamic porosity conditions (Heckel analysis) are supported by classical viscoelastic tests carried out under conditions of static porosity...|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{the awkward}} layout of tablet instruments, signals and points levers at Abermule {{meant that it}} was {{possible}} for conflicting movements to be made. The inquiry recommended that <b>tablet</b> <b>machines</b> be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) be interlocked with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet. The signalling method continued in use on the line until 1988, when it was replaced by the radio-controlled electronic token block system.|$|R

An instrumented single-punch <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> was used for tablet compactions. The flowability of the powder mixtures composed of {{a high percentage of}} chitin and SDLC was clearly improved. The fractioned pure chitin powder was easily compressed into tablets by using a magnesium stearate level of 0. 1 % (w/w) but, as the die lubricant level was 0. 5 % (w/w), the tablet strength collapsed dramatically. The tablets compressed from the binary mixtures of MCC and SDLC exhibited elevated mechanical strengths (> 100  N) independent of the die lubricant level applied. In conclusion, fractioned chitin of crustacean origin can be used as an abundant direct-compression co-diluent with the established cellulosic excipients to modify the mechanical strength and, consequently, the disintegration of the tablets. Chitin of crustacean origin, however, is a lubrication-sensitive material, and this should be taken into account in formulating direct-compression tablets of it...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{establish}} a correlation between water uptake by anhydrous sodium naproxen (ASN) at two different relative humidities and modifications in tableting and densification behaviour under hydration. Water uptake was evaluated at different relative humidities. Models for the hydration kinetics of ASN at 55 % and 86 %. corresponding to the formation of the dihydrated and tetrahydrated forms, respectively, were evaluated assuming Eyring's dependence on temperature. Tabletability, compressibility, compactibility, and densification behaviour were determined using an instrumented single punch <b>tablet</b> <b>machine.</b> Kinetic data are consistent with a model where water molecules enter the crystal preferentially along hydrophilic tunnels existing in the crystal structure and corresponding to the propionate side chain. Water inclusion perturbs the crystallographic structure, causing slight structural changes according to the amount and associated to an increase in entropy. The interposition of water molecules between sodium naproxen molecules weakens intermolecular bonds, and these sites can behave like sliding planes under compression. Such structural changes may explain the improved compression behaviour and modified densification propensity mechanism. Kinetic data describing the water hydration mechanism of ASN explain in an original way the improved tableting and densification properties under hydration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

A 3 2 full factorial design was applied to investigate the combined effect of two formulation variables: Amount of SSG and CCS. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was performed to identify the physicochemical interaction between drug and polymer. IR spectroscopy showed that there is no interaction of drug with polymer.

Hygroscopicity, flow property and disintegration time were improved significantly due to the adsorption and granulation processes. Moreover, the DEP does not become mucilaginous even at higher relative humidity levels (above 65 %). Oblong tablets (20 [*]×[*] 8. 25  mm) containing 947  mg of the granulated DEP (equivalent to the traditional dose), 363  mg of Avicel® PH 101 and 90  mg of Ac-di-Sol® as disintegrant were formulated using an instrumented eccentric <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> at 20  kN.

40|$|The {{effect of}} punch tilting on the {{mechanism}} of punch penetration in the die of a rotary <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> during the compression cycle was evaluated by installing four displacement transducers on one station of a rotary machine. Two transducers were symmetrically positioned beside the upper punch in the upper turret, {{and the other two}} transducers were similarly placed beside the lower punch in the lower turret. Microcrystalline cellulose and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate were compressed at 5, 10, 15 and 20 kN using two different machine speeds, in order to quantify the effect of punch tilting in the evaluation of punch penetration. These compression data served to construct the powder bed reduction curves, from which it was possible to establish that punch tilting is directly proportional to the compression force used. Tilting is maximal {{at the beginning of the}} dwell time, disappears at half dwell time, and reaches a new maximum at the end of the dwell time. In latter case, tilting occurred in the direction opposite that of the first maximum. The impact of tilting in powder densification behaviour, evaluated through the construction of Heckel plots, depends on the compression force used in the analysis. Heckel plots are as distorted as the compression force is elevated. Consequently, the calculated Heckel parameters differ from the real values. Unless a very low compression force is used, a proper Heckel analysis can be performed in a rotary machine only if it is fitted with a device that includes the effect of punch tilting in the evaluation of punch penetration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the compressional behavior of granules containing high load of a Phyllanthus niruri spray-dried extract in eccentric (ETM) and rotary (RTM) tablet presses. Tablets were constituted by spray-dried extract granules (SDEG, 92 %), excipient granules (EXCG, 7. 92 %), and magnesium stearate (0. 08 %). SDEG was obtained by dry granulation and EXCG, composed of microcrystalline cellulose (62. 9 %) and sodium starch glycolate (37. 1 %), by wet granulation. Particle size distribution was fixed between 0. 250 and 0. 850  mm. Tablets did not evidence any mechanical failures, such as lamination or capping, or anomalous weight variation in either <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> types. Upper and lower tablet surface photomicrographs from ETM and RTM tablets showed differences in porosity and texture. Different RTM speeds suggested the visco-plastic behavior of the formulation, since, by slowing down rotation speeds, the tensile strength of the tablets increased significantly, but the porosity and disintegration time were not affected. Tablets produced in RTM showed lower friability and porosity than ETM tablets, which did not reflect on higher tensile strength. The EXCG distribution at upper and lower surfaces from ETM and RTM tablets was quantified by image analysis and evaluated through statistical methods. Spray-dried extract release was not influenced by the type of equipment or operational conditions to which the compacts were submitted. Construction and operation differences between both tablet presses influenced the final product, since tablets with similar tensile strength, made by distinct tablet machines, exhibited different quality parameters...|$|E

Tablets were obtained with a single station <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> (Korsch), using standard pressure, and obtaining tablets with 13 mm diameter, 800 mg weight and 400 mg pentoxifylline per tablet. The weight uniformity, friability, hardness, thickness and disintegration of tablets were determined according to the stipulations of the 2001 Supplement of the Romanian Pharmacopoeia Xth edition. The experimental formulations with 400 mg pentoxifylline/tablet were studied by comparing them to the industrial reference product, Trental 400 mg (Aventis Pharma) and in according to the stipulations of Romanian Pharmacopoeia Xth edition, USP 27 and European Pharmacopoeia 5 th edition.

40|$|Acetazolamide shows a {{very poor}} {{compression}} ability and tablets must usually be produced through a wet granulation process. However, the possibility to obtain pure acetazolamide for direct compression could be interesting for industrial application. With the scope to obtain a material for direct compression, three different crystallisation methods were chosen, with respect to acetazolamide solvent solubility. (a) Acetazolamide was dissolved in an ammonia solution and then spray dried. It was possible to characterise the spherical particles as a mixture of two polymorphic forms, I and II by Powder X-ray diffraction study. (b) Pure form I was obtained by slowly cooling to room temperature a boiling water solution. (c) Pure form II, the marketed form, was obtained by neutralisation of an ammonia solution. Their compression behaviour was investigated firstly by a rotary press. Whilst pure polymorphic forms I and II could not be compressed, the spray dried particles showed very good compression properties. In fact, tablets were obtained only by spray dried particles, which show very good properties under compression {{and the absence of}} capping tendency. On the other hand, it was impossible to obtain tablets from polymorphic forms I and II, whatever compression pressures were used. In order to explain their densification mechanism, a single-punch <b>tablet</b> <b>machine,</b> equipped for the measurement of the upper punch displacement in the die, was used. From calculated Heckel’s parameters, it was demonstrated that the spray dried material shows a greater particle rearrangement in the initial stage of compression due to its spherical habit and minor wrinkledness of particle surface. The crystalline structure due to the presence of polymorphic forms I and II concur to lowering the intrinsic elasticity of the material. This fact avoids the risk of the rupturing the interpaticulate bonds, which are formed during the compression, concurring to the consolidation of the tablet...|$|E
40|$|Cyclodextrins (CDs) are annular {{oligosaccharides}} containing 6 - 12 glucose unities {{joined together}} by alpha- 1, 4 bonds. They have a conical-truncated shape with a lipophilic cavity in which different molecules can be included {{resulting in a}} stable inclusion complex. The cyclodextrins have been widely applied in pharmaceutical technology {{with the objective of}} increasing the solubility, stability and bioavailability of drugs in different pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as tablets. In order to obtain beta-CD tablets, liquid dispersions of drug/beta-CD are usually submitted to different drying processes, like spray-drying, freeze-drying or slow evaporation, being this dry material added to a number of excipients. However, such drying processes can generate particulate materials showing problems of flow and compressibility, needing their conversion into granulates by means of wetting with granulation liquid followed by additional drying. In this work, the main objective was to evaluate the preparation of tablets without the need of this additional drying step. For this purpose an aqueous dispersion containing acetaminophen/beta-CD complex and cornstarch was dried using a spouted bed and the obtained granules were compressed in tablets. Acetaminophen was used as model drug due to its low water solubility and the inexpensive and widely available cornstarch was chosen as excipient. Acetaminophen powder was added into a beta-cyclodextrin solution prepared in distilled water at 70 degrees C. Stirring was kept until this dispersion cooled to room temperature. Then cornstarch was added and the resulting dispersion was dried in spouted bed equipment. This material was compressed into tablets using an Erweka Korsh EKO <b>tablet</b> <b>machine.</b> This innovative approach allowed the tablets preparation process to be carried out with fewer steps and represents a technological reliable strategy to produce beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes tablets.

40|$|Lactoferrin (Lf) is a {{potential}} drug candidate {{for the treatment of}} oropharyngeal Candida infections. However, for an effective therapeutic treatment an appropriate dosage form is required. Therefore a mucoadhesive tablet for buccal application was developed. Tablets of sufficient strength could be produced on high speed <b>tabletting</b> <b>machines,</b> but they could only be obtained when the protein contained at least 7 % moisture. The tablet contained sodium alginate both for its release-controlling properties as well as for its mucoadhesive properties. Furthermore, phosphate buffer was added to keep the pH of the saliva in the mouth within the range of 6. 5 to 7. 5. In this pH range, Lf has shown to have its highest activity against Candida growth inhibition. The tablet formulation containing Lf had the same antifungal properties as compared with Lf alone, because in most cases identical inhibitory concentrations were observed against several clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. In human volunteers the tablets, containing 250 mg Lf and placed in each pouch, were able to keep the Lf concentration in the saliva at effective levels for at least 2 hr, while the pH of the saliva remained within the desired range.

The tissues were fastened to the basket end with an elastic band and the gum tablet placed on the mucosal surface carefully. This was then lowered into a beaker containing phosphate buffer solution of pH 6.8. The beaker sits within a large water bath with temperature set at 37  °C. The machine was then set at 50 revolutions per minute which mimics the in vivo physiologic fluid, pH, temperature and peristaltic movement of contractile smooth muscles.|$|R
