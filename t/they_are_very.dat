5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket.

5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> large with {{an upward}} diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and {{arboreal}} quadrupeds, often observed leaping {{through the}} upper canopy of the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They {{are also the}} most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sensitive to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal, and have loud, raucous calls.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American alligators are extremely rare and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild.

5|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds. They are medium-sized passerines with strong feet.

Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E

5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|Stelae became closely {{associated}} with the concept of divine kingship and declined {{at the same time as}} this institution. The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic (c. 900–1521). The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> poorly preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> stable.|$|E
