40|$|The diet {{composition}} of fish caught in San Miguel Bay, Philippines, in April and May 1993 was studied. The diets of <b>tiger-tooth</b> <b>croaker</b> (Otolithes ruber), commerson's anchovy (Stolephorus commersonii); and the Indian anchovy (Stolephorus indicus) consisted mainly of zooplankton, primarily crustaceans. The stomach content of orangefin ponyfish (Leiognathus bindus) {{was found to}} consist mostly of detritus and unidentified materials. Daily rations estimated were: 1. 90 g day super(1) for O. ruber of 17. 3 g mean body weight (BW), 0. 078 g day super(1) for S. commersonii) of 3. 8 g mean BW, 0. 062 g day super(1) for S. indicus of 3. 9 g mean BW and 0. 56 g day super(1) for L. bindus of 7. 7 g mean BW...|$|E
40|$|Total and {{methylmercury}} {{concentrations were}} assessed in muscle and liver of 141 fish {{samples from the}} northern part of the Persian Gulf. All fish samples belonged to five different species: grunt, flathead, greasy grouper, <b>tiger-tooth</b> <b>croaker,</b> and silver pomfret. In addition, Hg and methylmercury were analyzed in scalp hair of 19 fishermen living in the same coastal stations of the Persian Gulf and consuming several fish meals a week. Total mercury concentrations in fish muscle and liver ranged from 0. 01 to 1. 35  µg g - 1 w. w. and from 0. 02 to 1. 30  µg g - 1 w. w., respectively. In fish muscle, 3 % of the Hg concentrations were higher than 0. 5  µg g - 1 w. w., which corresponds to the maximum acceptable WHO level, while 9 % were in the range of polluted fish (between 0. 3 and 0. 5  µg g - 1 w. w.). The highest mercury concentrations in fish muscle were observed in flathead fish at Abadan (average of 0. 68  µ g g - 1 w. w.). Methylmercury fractions in fish muscle and liver amount to 34 – 99 % (median 64 %) and 24 – 70 % (median 43 %), respectively. The mean total Hg concentration in the fishermen’s scalp hair amounted to 2. 9 ± 2. 2  µ g g - 1, with 68 % in the form of methylmercury. Ninety-five percent of the Hg levels in the fishermen’s hair were below 10  µ g g - 1, which is the WHO warning limit. In addition, relationships between the mercury levels in hair, on the one hand, and exposure-related factors such as Hg levels in specific fish species, regional differences, and number of fish meals, on the other hand, are discussed. It appears that a significant correlation for example exists between Hg levels human hair and fish muscle or human hair and age and that mean mercury levels in fish muscle and human hair decreased from western (Abadan) to eastern (Abbas port) coastal sites...|$|E
