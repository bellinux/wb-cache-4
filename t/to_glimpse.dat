5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E
25|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{developed in}} the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis. The humanistic approach sought <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions. Humanism focused on uniquely human issues, such as free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. It emphasized subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy. Later, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.|$|E
25|$|As the Dravanians {{prepare to}} resume their siege of Ishgard, Alphinaud {{suggests}} that they use Lady Iceheart to broker peace with Nidhogg through negotiation. Estinien offers his lance to aid this endeavor, promising to slay the great wyrm if words come to blows. Iceheart reveals that she too possesses the Echo and used it <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> at the truth behind the war. Born Ysayle, she took the name Iceheart after communing with the soul of Shiva, the mortal woman whose love for the great wyrm Hraesvelgr allowed man and dragon to coexist peacefully for two hundred years. Yet the Elezen grew envious of the dragons' power and conspired to steal Nidhogg's eye, {{the source of his}} strength. This, she claims, is the origin of the Dragonsong War. Aiming to avoid further bloodshed, Ysayle agrees to take the party to parley with Hraesvelgr for his aid in ending the war.|$|E

25|$|The first {{creations of}} towns {{are linked to}} a system of specialism at {{individual}} settlements, which is evidenced in studying place-names. Sutterton, 'shoe-makers' tun' (in the area of the Danelaw such places are Sutterby) was so-named because local circumstances allowed the growth of a craft recognised by the people of surrounding places. Similarly with Sapperton, the 'soap-makers' tun. While Boultham, the 'meadow with burdock plants', may well have developed a specialism in the production of burrs for wool-carding, since meadows with burdock merely growing in them must have been relatively numerous. From places named for their services or location within a single district, a category of which the most obvious perhaps are the Eastons and Westons, it is possible to move outwards <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> component settlements within larger economic units. Names betray some role within a system of seasonal pasture, Winderton in Warwickshire is the winter tun and various Somertons are self-explanatory. Hardwicks are dairy farms and Swinhopes the valleys where pigs were pastured.|$|E
25|$|The group {{formally}} meets Diana {{who they}} learn has a frail body and has lost her will to live. Diana {{has the power}} <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> into the future and see people's fates but Shinjiro eventually convinces her {{that even if the}} circumstances look dire, she can fight her destiny and give her a new path to follow. Diana joins the Star Division and helps them repel an attack by Yumedono, a vain woman who wants to engulf New York in insects. After losing a duel with Subaru, Shinjiro is forced to perform on stage as a new star called Peppermint. Subaru questions why Shinjiro is able to succeed even though he is flawed. Subaru opens herself up to the group eventually recognizing everyone's importance in her life, including Shinjiro's. The Star Division repels an attack led by Tsugarubi, who resents women and steals their life essence turning them into stone. Soon, after learning about the Five Star Warriors, Shinjiro recruits Gemini to the Star Division due to her ties to the Five Star Warriors. But in discovering that Ranmaru is one of their enemies, Gemini's sister Geminine—who resides in her body as an alter-ego—plots to exact revenge for her master's death. Shinjiro persuades Geminine not to go through with it. Afterwards, subduing an attack led by Ranmaru, Geminine decides to rest inside Gemini for a while after using too much of her influence to dominate Gemini's body.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the two [...] "silent" [...] pilots before it, The Muppet Show series {{incorporated}} its own laugh track {{onto the}} show, {{but in a}} completely different manner; because the variety program was modeled after vaudeville, the viewers were often treated <b>to</b> <b>glimpses</b> of the theater audience and their reactions to The Muppets' antics on stage (though the audience was composed of Muppet characters as well).|$|R

We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|Before the Marcoses' {{departure}} for the inauguration ceremonies, they held {{mass in the}} courtyard of their house in Ortega Street, San Juan. Imelda invited an old German priest, Father Albert Ganzewinkel, who had been her favorite teacher at St. Paul in Tacloban, to hold the mass. Ferdinand and Imelda then went to the Luneta Park for the inauguration ceremonies and were seated {{at the very center of}} the Luneta grandstand. They were surrounded by foreign dignitaries and government officials. Allegedly, a mass of anonymous men and women attended the ceremony <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> the beauty of the new First Lady. After the ceremony, she was described as someone with [...] "such dignity, such regality." ...|$|E
500|$|Bobby tracks Lilith to New Harmony, Indiana. Dean {{does not}} want to attack unprepared, but he refuses to seek help from Ruby. Sam {{secretly}} summons her and asks for her knife, and Ruby tells him that his dormant psychic abilities could easily kill Lilith, whose guard is down as she is on [...] "shore leave". Sam considers the alternative, but Dean shows up and tricks Ruby into a devil's trap—mystical symbols capable of rendering a demon powerless—and the brothers take her knife and leave. Despite Dean's objections, Bobby insists that he accompany them, and draws attention to Dean's hallucinations. With his demise rapidly approaching, Dean has begun [...] "piercing the veil", allowing him <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> the demons' true forms.|$|E

500|$|With {{the beaches}} still open, people pour to the town, hoping <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> the killer shark. Brody sets up patrols {{to watch for}} the fish. [...] After a boy {{narrowly}} escapes another attack close to the shore, Brody closes the beaches and hires Quint, a professional shark hunter, to kill the shark. [...] Brody, Quint, and Hooper set out on Quint's vessel, the Orca. The trio are soon at odds with one another. Quint's methods anger Hooper, especially when he disembowels a blue shark, and then uses an illegally fished unborn dolphin for bait. All the while, Quint taunts Hooper as a rich college boy. Brody and Hooper also argue, as Brody's suspicions about Hooper's possible affair with Ellen grow stronger; at one point, Brody unsuccessfully attempts to strangle Hooper.|$|E
500|$|The Dumas Brothel Museum is {{a two-story}} brick {{building}} at {{the north side of}} east Mercury street in the historic city of Butte, Montana.

[...] The original structure features original vaulted skylights, and the upper level is surrounded by an interior balcony, which still provides a birds eye view for on-lookers <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> the suites (or [...] "cribs") below. The basement afforded much more basic accommodations, and was built to connect the Dumas to Butte's business corridor via a subterranean tunnel system.|$|E
500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a {{felt-tip}} pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long enough for her <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E

500|$|William Bertram Turrill {{introduced}} the term [...] "alpha taxonomy" [...] {{in a series}} of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy. … there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetical colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable … Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated [...] "alpha", it is possible <b>to</b> <b>glimpse</b> a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which [...] "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized.

30|$|Despite {{living in}} an {{agricultural}} country many people in New Zealand do not necessarily have direct contact with farmed animals. Experience of farm life may be limited <b>to</b> <b>glimpses</b> of animals in paddocks from the roadside which reveal what are often perceived as naturalized lives. Cattle graze seemingly contentedly on lush grass, an image that dairy giant Fonterra is keen to capitalize on through TVCs and other advertisements depicting cows grazing on prime real estate (Fonterra, 2016 a). The idea that farmed animals have a good life in New Zealand rests on the idealization of agriculture and rural life (Potts, 2013).|$|R
