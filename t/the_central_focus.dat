5|$|Ellie {{was created}} by Neil Druckmann, the {{creative}} director and writer of The Last of Us. Inspired by a mute character proposed for , Druckmann created her as a strong female character with {{a close relationship with}} Joel; throughout the game's development, the relationship between Ellie and Joel was <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus,</b> with all other elements developed around it. Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Naughty Dog also redesigned her appearance during the game's development to more closely resemble Johnson. Her appearance has also been compared to that of actress Ellen Page.|$|E

5|$|Though Ellie was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} Joel's daughter, the team found this to be too limiting in terms of further character development. The team chose Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie, respectively. Providing both the voice and motion capture of the characters, Baker and Johnson assisted the team to develop the characters and help refine the story. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> of the game, and all other elements were developed around it. Various other characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision.|$|E

It took place at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York on March 20, 1994. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> of the pay-per-view was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which was defended in two matches. Lex Luger challenged champion Yokozuna first but was disqualified for pushing the referee. Bret Hart faced Yokozuna {{later in the evening}} and won the championship by pinning Yokozuna. This led to a lengthy worked feud between Bret and his brother Owen, who had defeated Bret in the opening match of the pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} water supply from Aldershawe was {{diminishing}} {{in the early}} 19th century, money was spent diverting surface waters from 'Swan Moggs' into a common conduit. The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool. The area was subsequently developed into the formal gardens of Beacon Park by the Lichfield Corporation, but {{paid for by the}} Conduit Lands Trust. The Museum Gardens were opened in 1859 to complement the new Italianate Free Library and Museum. The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1891, is the small area between the Museum Gardens and the wider Beacon Park. The central fountain was unveiled as <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> of the Museum Gardens in 1871. A bandstand was also installed close to the junction of the Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds, and was positioned to provide a focus for the avenue through the Museum Gardens.|$|E

5|$|In {{both the}} campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater as <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> of French efforts, but in both {{instances}} the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest. Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Masséna would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Armée d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} and model the {{behavior}} of a prototype microfluidic device which employs two non-mixing fluids (sheath and inlet fluids) displaying an asymmetric focused flow, {{in the presence of a}} fluorescent dye. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is employed, allowing the precise measure of flow speeds across the channels and of the concentration profile of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focused</b> flux along <b>the</b> flow direction. The system is modeled via a standard Navier-Stokes finite-element approach, coupled to convection-diffusion equations for the solute. Simulations reproduce accurately the shape, the position, and the width of the velocity and concentration profiles along <b>the</b> <b>central</b> channel and across the transversal and vertical sections of the microfluidic device.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine whether abrupt onsets are capable of reflexively capturing attention when they occur outside the current focus of spatial attention, {{as would be expected}} if exogenous orienting operates in a truly automatic fashion. The authors established a highly focused attentional state by means of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> presentation of a stream of visual or auditory characters, which participants sometimes had to monitor. No intramodal reflexive cuing effects were observed in either audition or vision when participants performed either an exogenous visual or auditory orthogonal cuing task together with <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focused</b> attention task. These results suggest that reflexive unimodal orienting is not truly automatic. The fact that cuing effects were eliminated under both unimodal and cross-modal conditions is consistent with the view that auditory and visual reflexive spatial orienting are controlled by a common underlying neural substrate...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was {{the starting point of}} the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape.

50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>focuses</b> of Control Room is on {{the alleged}} {{friendly}} fire attack against the Baghdad headquarters of Al Jazeera, on 8 April 2003.

Lots of doubt is expressed within as to whether such an explanation is viable. During the attack, one correspondent working for the news network, Tarek Ayyoub, was killed; the film records one subsequent episode during a press conference, when Ayyoub's widow beseeches journalists to 'tell the truth' concerning her husband's death, for the sake of those innocents already killed during the war.|$|R
