We investigate this issue in two controlled experiments that compare performance between one and <b>two</b> <b>layer</b> displays in users’ perception of two potentially interfering virtual layers of information.

5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units.

The separation between the <b>two</b> <b>layers</b> is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a new {{approach}} to the three or four layer channel routing problem. Since <b>two</b> <b>layer</b> channel routing has been well studied, there are several <b>two</b> <b>layer</b> routers which can produce optimal or near optimal solution for almost all the practical problems. We develop a general technique which transforms a <b>two</b> <b>layer</b> routing solution systematically into a three layer routing solution. The solution transformation approach is different from previous approaches for three layer and multi-layer channel routing. Our router performs well in comparison with other three layer channel routers proposed thus far. In particular, it provides a 10 -track optimal solution for the famous Deutsch's difficult example, whereas other well-known three layer channel routers required 11 or more tracks. We extend our approach to four layer channel routing. Given any <b>two</b> <b>layer</b> channel routing solution without unrestricted dogleg that uses w tracks, our router can provably obtain a four layer routi [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, and one or <b>two</b> <b>layers</b> of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are <b>two</b> <b>layers</b> of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between <b>two</b> <b>layers</b> of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E

Though most discrepancies are less than 50 percent, a few cases differ by about 100 percent and more. Several possible reasons for these discrepancies are advanced, including geoid error, but only two oceanographic contributions to the variability are examined, namely, limitations in the <b>two</b> <b>layer</b> model and meanders in the current.

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of <b>two</b> <b>layers</b> of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the <b>two</b> <b>layers</b> are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E

5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin.

The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins.

40|$|<b>Two</b> <b>layer</b> {{control systems}} {{are common in}} robot architectures. The lower level is {{designed}} to provide fast, fine grained control while the higher level plans longer term sequences of actions to achieve some goal. Our approach uses reinforcement learning (RL) for the low level and Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planning for the high level. Because both levels can adapt their behavior within the scope of their tasks, the combination is expected to be robust to degradations in sensor and actuator failures and so to enhance overall system reliability. We implemented our architecture for use in the Khepera robot simulator. In a set of experiments, we show that good performance can be difficult to achieve with hand coded low level control and that performance of our RL/POMDP system degrades slowly with increasing sensor and actuator failure. 1 Introduction <b>Two</b> <b>layer</b> control systems are common in robot architectures. <b>Two</b> <b>layer</b> control is a pragmatic solution to different [...] ...|$|R
