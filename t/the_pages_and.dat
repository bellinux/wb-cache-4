5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward, although more solid evidence for {{their presence in the}} royal court dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). While conscripted pages would have looked forward to a lifelong career at court or even a prestigious post as a governor, they can also be regarded as hostages held by the royal court in order to ensure the loyalty and obedience of their aristocratic fathers. The abusive punishment of pages, such as flogging, carried out by the king at times, led to intrigue and conspiracy against the Crown, as did the frequent homosexual relations between <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> the elite, sometimes with the king. Although there is little evidence for royal pages throughout the Antigonid period, it is known that a group of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.|$|E

25|$|In 1957 Roth {{married an}} Icelandic student Sigríður Björnsdóttir, and moved {{with her back}} to Reykjavik. Cut off from centres of European modernism, Roth started {{publishing}} a series of highly influential artist's books, and to publish these books he founded, with Icelandic poet Einar Bragi, the publishing company forlag ed. In works such as Bok ("Book") 1958, cut holes in <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> dispensed with the codex, allowing the reader to rearrange the pages in any order they wished, whilst Daily Mirror Book, 1961, used the found material of a newspaper cut into 2cm squares and then rebound as a 150-page book.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E
25|$|Spirou as well had to {{introduce}} new artists and series to fill <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> keep their readers. It took {{many of them}} until around 1970 to become real stars, {{with the rise of}} Raoul Cauvin as the new main writer of the magazine. The biggest new series of the 1960s was Boule et Bill by Franquin-collaborator Jean Roba. It became the most popular series of the magazine together with Gaston Lagaffe after the disappearance of Lucky Luke in 1967. Around 1970, Berck (Sammy), Lambil (Les Tuniques Bleues), François Walthéry (Natacha), and Leloup (Yoko Tsuno) were the main new artists and series, with Raoul Cauvin as the most important writer. However, the top circulation of about 280,000 copies a week (France and Belgium combined), was no longer reached after 1966.|$|E

25|$|Zimmermann {{challenged}} {{these regulations}} in an imaginative way. He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book, via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold widely. Anybody wishing {{to build their}} own copy of PGP could cut off the covers, separate <b>the</b> <b>pages,</b> <b>and</b> scan them using an OCR program (or conceivably enter it as a type-in program if OCR software was not available), creating a set of source code text files. One could then build the application using the freely available GNU Compiler Collection. PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was simple: export of munitions—guns, bombs, planes, and software—was (and remains) restricted; but the export of books is protected by the First Amendment. The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases addressing other encryption software, however, two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).|$|E
500|$|Kirkus Reviews {{described}} Voices {{as a story}} [...] "fraught {{with political}} tension", and stated that though the analogies to contemporary politics were clear, Le Guin's world building was so thorough that the story did not [...] "bludgeon readers with allegory", and allowed them to imagine alternatives to violence, and to appreciate the power of language. The San Francisco Chronicle also wrote that the themes of the book were timely, and that while the plot had [...] "high stakes", Le Guin [...] " [...] her prose calm and free of melodrama." [...] Le Guin's prose was likewise praised by a review in The Buffalo News, which said that [...] "The power of the novel lies...in the language that leaps from <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> into the brain pan, producing a lovely explosion there." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> bashed the diaries against his desk {{to give them an}} aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.|$|E

The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do.

2500|$|Torrey {{has been}} a vocal critic of the {{failures}} of deinstitutionalization and inadequate community mental health services. He has generally linked this to issues of violence, homelessness and medication noncompliance, as well as lack of proper focus by the relevant governmental organizations. He {{has been a}}ccused of gaining influence by sensationalizing and exaggerating the incidence of violence and its link to medication noncompliance, including disseminating unsubstantiated and unreliable statistics. When a California NAMI journal editor included a questioning of Torrey's statistics, the local board glued together <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> effectively shut down the journal. Others, while agreeing that public mental health care in the U.S. falls far short of what people with serious psychiatric disorders need and deserve, have argued that Torrey's solutions are outdated and that his book The Insanity Offense is based on unsubstantiated portrayals of certainty on the statistics on violence, outpatient commitment and medication, stigmatizing tens of thousands of people, deeply offending and insulting those who hold views differing from his own, and promulgating one-dimensional solutions. TAC's attempts to associate violent incidents in the news with lack of medication have been described as wild hyperbole, {{and the use of the}} term [...] "assisted treatment" [...] has been described as a euphemism for forced drugging.|$|E
