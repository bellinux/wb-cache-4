25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> anything {{is that we}} can be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E

The Ayn Rand Society, dedicated to fostering the scholarly study of Objectivism, is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association's Eastern Division. Aristotle scholar and Objectivist Allan Gotthelf, chairman of the Society, and his colleagues have argued for more academic study of Objectivism, viewing the philosophy as a unique and intellectually interesting defense of classical liberalism <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> debating. In 1999 a refereed Journal of Ayn Rand Studies began. In 2006 the University of Pittsburgh held a conference focusing on Objectivism. Programs and fellowships for the study of Objectivism have been supported at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas at Austin and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.|$|E

25|$|Fritz Beblo {{began as}} a city {{building}} inspector in Strasbourg, which had belonged {{to the state of}} Elsass-Lothringen (Alsace-Lorraine) in the German Empire since 1871. At the beginning of the 20th century, Strasbourg was also {{in the midst of a}} lot of building activity (the Neustadt). In 1910, Fritz Beblo was named head of the building department and building control office (Baurat, building officer). He received support for his plans from Rudolf Schwander, the mayor. Beblo's name is especially connected with the Musau-Schule (1904–1906), the Thomasschule (1905–1907), the Neufeldschule (1907–1909, today the Collège Louise Weiss), the Haushaltsschule beside the Magdalenenkirche (1909–1910), the Magdalenenkirche, the Grande Percée (Neue Straße) and the swimming pool and thermal baths Bains Municipaux (1905–1910). This art nouveau style bath is considered one of his finest works and is protected as a historical monument. The last work of Beblo in Strasbourg <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> mentioning is the grounds of the Nordfriedhof (Northern Cemetery). He was not able to complete this work, having to leave the city of Strasbourg after the end of the First World War, since he was a German official and the city had become French again.|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth.</b> Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

500|$|The {{performances}} of the lead characters were generally praised, especially Basset's.

As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E
500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{met with}} a divided {{reaction}} from fans and music critics, who {{were not used to}} the album's production and lyrical content. Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn expressed a mixed response towards the band's stylistic change from [...] "soulflavored" [...] songs such as [...] "Everyday People" [...] and [...] "Hot Fun in the Summertime", stating [...] "there is little on the album <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> your attention". Other major music publications praised this new direction: in his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Vince Aletti wrote that [...] "At first I hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But then I began to respect the album's honesty". Aletti cited it as [...] "one of the most important fucking albums this year" [...] and [...] "the new urban music... not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying. There are flashes of euphoria, ironic laughter, even some bright stretches but mostly it's just junkie death, oddly unoppressive and almost attractive in its effortlessness". [...] A columnist for Hit Parader magazine gave Riot a favorable review, and stated that the album has [...] "a lot that makes Sly the in-person rave that he is." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism", backed by [...] "subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions". He declared Riot [...] "one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts". Greil Marcus called the record [...] "Muzak with its finger on the trigger." ...|$|E

500|$|At its core, {{the game}} is a quiz {{competition}} in which {{the goal is to}} correctly answer a series of fourteen (originally fifteen) consecutive multiple-choice questions. The questions are of increasing difficulty, except in the 2010–15 format overhaul, where the contestants were faced with a round of ten questions of random difficulty, followed by a round of four questions of increasing difficulty. Each question is worth a specified amount of money; the amounts are cumulative in the first round, but not in the second. If the contestant gives a wrong answer to any question, their game is over and their winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant has the option of [...] "walking away" [...] without giving an answer after being presented with a question, in which case the game ends and the contestant is guaranteed to walk away with all the money they have previously received. With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if (s)he answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format era, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.|$|E
2500|$|Possible {{motivations for}} this can include obtaining payment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> {{more than the}} value of the {{property}} destroyed, or to destroy and subsequently receive payment for goods that could not otherwise be sold. [...] According to Alfred Manes, the majority of property insurance crimes involve arson. One {{reason for this is that}} any evidence that a fire was started by arson is often destroyed by the fire itself. [...] According to the United States Fire Administration, in the United States there were approximately 31,000 fires caused by arson in 2006, resulting in losses of $755 million.|$|E

I {{expected it to be}} a lot worse. I can't believe that this has been singled out as something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> banning."

2500|$|In Italy {{there is}} the story called Il Bel Gherardino. It is the most ancient {{prototype}} of an Italian singing fairy tale by an anonymous Tuscan author. It {{tells the story of}} a young Italian knight, depleted for its [...] "magnanimitas", who gets the love of a fairy. When he loses this love because he does not comply with his conditions, Gherardino reconquers his lady after a series of labours, including the prison where he is rescued by another woman and a tournament where he wins. Other examples of Italian (Tuscan) poetry tales are Antonio Pucci's literature: Gismirante, Il Brutto di Bretagna or Brito di Bretagna ("The ugly knight of Britain") and Madonna Lionessa ("Lioness Lady").

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, a 1933 double eagle was {{auctioned}} off for US$7,590,020 which shattered the old record of $4,140,000 paid at a public auction for an 1804 silver dollar. This piece is unique as the only 1933 double eagle the U.S. government has deemed legal for its citizens to own (having been negotiated as such through terms of a U.S. treaty with a foreign government). [...] Even illegal instances of the 1933 double eagle could be worth {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, but it would be illegal for a U.S. coin dealer to broker a deal with one of these coins. There is no other date of St.-Gaudens double eagle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> a significant fraction of this extraordinary coin. A complete uncirculated set of all other St.-Gaudens double eagles could be put together for just over three million dollars (less than half the price paid for the 1933), including the extremely rare, ultra-high relief, proof pattern. Without the rare pattern, the set would be less than $750,000.|$|E
2500|$|Saudi Arabia and King Fahd {{initially}} came {{in shock}} {{when the news}} reached to Saudi Arabia, prompting King Fahd to contact the Pakistan Army over this military coup. Pakistan, under Nawaz Sharif and Saudi Arabia, under King Fahd, enjoyed extremely close business and cultural relations that is sometimes attributed as special relationships. Amid pressure exerted by the US President Bill Clinton and King Fahd, the military court avoided the award of a death sentence to Sharif. During the state visit of General Musharraf, King Fahd showed his concern over the trial as the king was worried that the death sentence would provoke more and intense ethnic violence in Pakistan {{as it did in}} the 1980s. Under an agreement facilitated by Saudi Arabia, Sharif was placed in exile for the next 10 years and through the Saudi Arabian Airlines. Sharif agreed not to take part in politics in Pakistan for 21 years. He has also forfeited property worth $8.3million (£5.7million) and agreed to pay a fine of $500,000. Sharif travelled to Jeddah where he was received by the Saudi officials and taken to a residence managed and controlled by the Saudi government. At Jaddah, the Saudi Arabian government gave Sharif a loan to establish a steel mill and Sharif bought land where he established the iron-steel mill foundry <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> millions of dollars. During this episode of military coup, General Musharraf wrote in [...] that, thanks to Saudi Arabia and King Fahd, Sharif's life was spared by the military court otherwise Sharif would have met the same fate as of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1979.|$|E
