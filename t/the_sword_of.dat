5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: <b>the</b> <b>Sword</b> <b>of</b> Spiritual Justice, <b>the</b> <b>Sword</b> <b>of</b> Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation regalia in the 17thcentury.|$|E
