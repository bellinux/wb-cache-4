5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> {{had counted}} on winning the {{nomination}} by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

25|$|During a {{majority}} of the final campaigning, the attacks between <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> and the Obama campaign highly intensified by the candidates as well as the media coverage. Barack Obama began to attack former President Bill Clinton for his comments which were taken as racist. These comments are considered by analyst and historians alike as the turning point of the South Carolina primary and ultimately the cause of Clinton's loss of support from the black community.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} {{followed}} by CTV's Washington bureau chief, Tom Clark, who reported that Obama's campaign, not Clinton's, had reassured Canadian diplomats.

25|$|Wikileaks has popularised conspiracies {{about the}} Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting an article which {{suggested}} Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals (which was later {{revealed to be}} false), implying that the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed, suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews, claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange, promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health, and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump-related Internet community tying <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> to child kidnapper Laura Silsby.|$|E
25|$|In her Senate career, Senator Clinton {{is often}} seen wearing a suit.

Stein petitioned for a recount in these states. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> pledged to participate in the Green Party recount efforts, while Trump backers challenged them in court. Meanwhile, American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente petitioned for and was granted a partial recount in Nevada.|$|E
25|$|As the {{primaries}} continued, various groups tried {{to negotiate a}} resolution to the standoff between the DNC and the state parties. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>campaign</b> advocated first for the results to stand and then for {{a new round of}} voting to take place in Michigan and Florida, while the Obama campaign deferred the matter to the DNC, while expressing a wish that the delegations be seated in some form. On all sides, Democrats worried that a failure to resolve the problem could lead to a rules or credential fight at the convention and low Democratic turnout in the general election in November.|$|E
