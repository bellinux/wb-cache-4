50|$|Most {{state legislatures}} use Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure. In this book, the motions {{to lay on}} the table and to <b>take</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> table have the same {{characteristics}} as under RONR. Mason's Manual has another motion, <b>take</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> desk, which a member uses when they desire to take up a matter that is on the desk, but on which no action has yet been taken. The differences between the two motions are that <b>the</b> motion to <b>take</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> table is used after an item has been placed on the desk by a previous use of a motion to lay {{on the table and}} the motion is given a preference over new main motions offered at <b>the</b> same time. <b>Take</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> desk is used when an item is taken up that has not yet been introduced and this motion has no preference over new main motions that may be made at the same time.|$|R
