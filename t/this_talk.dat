5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country.

500|$|In house music, {{a desire}} to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the {{interposition}} of prefixes like [...] "progressive", [...] "tribal", and [...] "intelligent". According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term [...] "progressive" [...] was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed [...] "progressive" [...] because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. In this context, Reynolds criticizes terms like [...] "progressive" [...] and [...] "intelligent", arguing that [...] "when an underground scene starts talking <b>this</b> <b>talk,</b> it's usually a sign that it's gearing up the media game as a prequel to buying into traditional music industry structure of auteur-stars, concept albums, and long-term careers. Above all, it's a sign of impending musical debility, creeping self-importance, and the hemorrhaging away of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{recognition}} of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925, followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal (1925–7) from the Royal College of Surgeons, which came with a prize of £50. The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929), a [...] "classic piece of research" [...] still referred to forty-five years later in 1974 as [...] "the standard reference book" [...] on this topic. Negus's work had shown that the main function of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the voice is only a byproduct of this more vital function. Another lecture resulting from this work was given {{under the auspices of}} the University of London's Semon Lectureship, named after the German-born British laryngologist Felix Semon (1849–1921). <b>This</b> <b>talk</b> was delivered on 6 November 1930 at the Royal Society of Medicine under the title [...] "Observations on Semon's Law".|$|E
