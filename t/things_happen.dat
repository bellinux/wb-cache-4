5|$|Similar <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> {{in other}} brain areas: an initial {{synaptic}} matrix is generated {{as a result}} of genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.|$|E
5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected <b>things</b> <b>happen,</b> so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E

5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these <b>things</b> <b>happen,</b> but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E

25|$|The major {{difference}} between Machiavelli and the Socratics, according to Strauss, is Machiavelli's materialism and therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature, and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their teleological understanding of things, Socratics argued that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli emphasized that such <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> by blind chance, or human action.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} by the superstitious that bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> on that score, {{although}} {{an investigation by}} the magazine The Cricketer in the 1990s found that wickets are no more likely to fall on Nelson and indeed, the score at which most wickets fall is 0 (a duck). It may be considered unlucky because the number resembles a wicket without bails (a batsman is out if the bails are knocked off their wicket).|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} Hadaka Matsuri date back 500 years when worshippers competed to receive paper talismans called Go-o thrown by the priest.

As those people receiving these paper talismans had good <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> to them, {{the number of people}} requesting them increased year by year. However, as paper is easily destroyed, the talismans were changed to the wooden ofuda that we know today.|$|E

25|$|The first World Series {{night game}} was played in Three Rivers Stadium on October 13, 1971 — eleven {{years to the day}} since Mazeroski's walk-off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960. In this case, however, it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, rather than a decisive Game 7. Apparently, good <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> for the Pirates on this date, as they knotted the '71 Series at two games apiece on their way to their fourth title.|$|E

From 1965–67, Haworth was a regular cast member in the children's adventure series Adventures of the Seaspray as Susan Wells. Haworth also made appearances on children's television series The Magic Boomerang and the crime drama Homicide during the mid-to late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why do bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> to good people?. Christianity teach {{that all people}} are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E
25|$|Fire: The fire {{signs are}} Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic, with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action making <b>things</b> <b>happen.</b> They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116).
