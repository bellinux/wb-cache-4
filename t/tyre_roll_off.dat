5000|$|Trials bike rims are {{significantly}} wider than those used for cross country, downhill and BMX bikes. Wider rims mean that any given tyre fitted {{to the rim}} will hold a bigger volume of air thanks to the tyre beads being held further apart by the rim. This means the tyre has a wider contact patch and therefore can be run at lower tyre pressure. The change in volume of a tyre on a wide rim when landed on a sharp corner will tend to be {{greater than that of}} a narrow rim, which again leads to improved pinch puncture resistance, critical for trials as landing on sharp edges is a very common requirement of both competition and street trials. A wider rim also makes it much harder for a <b>tyre</b> to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the rim when exposed to side loads, again a very common occurrence in trials riding.|$|R

5000|$|The Optimum [...] "L" [...] filter (also {{known as}} a Legendre-Papoulis filter) was {{proposed}} by Athanasios Papoulis in 1958.

It provides a compromise between the Butterworth filter which is monotonic but has a slower <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> and the Chebyshev filter which has a faster <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> but has ripple in either the pass band or stop band.
