5|$|During the Syrian Civil War in 2015, Palmyra {{came under}} the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and {{subsequently}} changed hands several times between <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> group and the Syrian Army who retook the city on 2 March 2017. ISIL sabotaged many artifacts and destroyed a number of buildings, considerably damaging the ancient site.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, the Somali {{government}} launched Operation Indian Ocean. On 1 September 2014, a U.S. drone strike {{carried out}} {{as part of}} the broader mission killed Al-Shabaab leader Moktar Ali Zubeyr. U.S. authorities hailed the raid as a major symbolic and operational loss for Al-Shabaab, and the Somali government offered a 45-day amnesty to all moderate members of <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> group.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>militants</b> {{began by}} attacking the first vehicle with machine gun fire, killing {{all four of}} the {{passengers}} in the car. Afterwards <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> attacked <b>the</b> second vehicle. One of the passengers in the second car jumped out in an attempt to escape <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> and save his life. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> killed him as well with machine-gun fire.|$|R
2500|$|Members of the Caracal Battalion [...] {{rushed to}} the scene of the attack and engaged in a firefight with <b>the</b> <b>militants.</b> During <b>the</b> {{exchange}} of fire, the explosive belt on one of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> detonated. Eventually <b>the</b> IDF forces at the site managed to kill <b>the</b> remaining two <b>militants.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> was killed by a female combat soldier from the Caracal Battalion.|$|R

5|$|The king of Kucha, Haripushpa, {{was taken}} to the Tang capital as a prisoner. Execution was the {{punishment}} of rebellion in accordance with Tang law. The king was pardoned by Taizong and released after a ritual venerating the emperor's ancestors. He was also named Great Army Commander for <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Guards of the Left, a title he received from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>militant</b> UPLB Perspective is the {{official}} student publication of UPLB. The university administration has been repeatedly criticized for allegedly interfering in the selection process of its editor-in-chief. Other campus publications include UPLB Horizon and UPLB Link. Meanwhile, the College of Development Communication (CDC) publishes the experimental community newspaper Los Baños Times.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1987, <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> {{youth groups}} had fought not only the Sri Lankan {{security}} forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. Some also function as paramilitary groups within the Sri Lankan military.|$|E
50|$|According to Naval Intelligence, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> entered <b>the</b> {{naval base}} from the {{airfield}} of Faisal Air Force Base, near Mehran Naval Base. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> then entered nearby buildings {{and opened fire}} indiscriminately, killing several naval personnel, and afterwards carried their raid {{into the heart of}} the base. According to the intelligence reports, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> were not Taliban, judging from their abilities and training.|$|R
50|$|Jiwan Singh took {{a strong}} stand against <b>the</b> pro-Khalistan <b>militants.</b> In 1986, he {{embarked}} on a door-to-door campaign in the Majha region, meeting the families of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> and asking for their help in persuading <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> {{to give up the}} violence. He also launched a 45-day padayatra, visiting those who had moved out of Punjab due to the violence, and convinced them to return. In retaliation, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> killed his son Sukhdev Singh Umranangal on 8 May 1987.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>militants</b> {{attacked}} two {{buses and}} killed 34 bus passengers. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> created roadblock {{by using a}} car and a Jeep. They singled out Hindu passengers and dragged them off and shot them to death.|$|R
5|$|In the {{scenario}} of the British war effort {{and the threat}} from <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> movement in India, {{it was a major}} factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915. Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael O'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement. It was also a factor that guided British political concessions and Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917. The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to the Soviet Union, and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in India.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>militant</b> suffragettes, {{who were}} at one point public enemies, were now seen as fierce {{nationalist}} and patriots. Old foes became allies and vice versa. Lloyd George was now referred to as 'that great Welshman' while Labours' Kier Hardie, the WSPU's staunchest defender before the war, was lambasted for his pacifist stance. There were still those in the suffragette movement who wished to keep pushing the agenda of emancipation. Some members of the WSPU broke away to form the Suffragettes of the WSPU (SWSPU), amongst their members were Conway-born Helena Jones, who continued to campaign for women's votes and was a columnist in the Suffragists News Sheet.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on {{the defeat of the}} Reds in the 1918 war and {{the fact that most of}} the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>militants</b> then {{expanded}} their {{base of operations}} and moved into the neighbouring Swat Valley, where they imposed Sharia law. The Pakistan Army launched an offensive to re-take the Swat Valley in 2007, {{but was unable to}} clear it of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> who had fled into the mountains and waited for them to leave before taking over the valley again. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> then launched another wave of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. The Pakistani government and military tried another peace deal with <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> in Swat Valley in 2008. This was roundly criticized in the West as abdicating to <b>the</b> <b>militants.</b> After initially pledging to lay down their arms if Sharia law was implemented, the Pakistani Taliban subsequently used the Swat Valley as a springboard to launch further attacks into neighbouring regions, reaching to within [...] of Islamabad.|$|R
5000|$|Every {{year the}} Armenian {{community}} in Lebanon holds memorial services {{to commemorate the}} deaths of <b>the</b> 5 <b>militants.</b> <b>The</b> Armenian community of Glendale, California, held a vigil at a local church to [...] "commemorate and honor the sacrifice" [...] of <b>the</b> five <b>militants.</b> <b>The</b> Armenian-American newspaper Asbarez in its editorial referred to <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> as [...] "freedom fighters and the heroes".|$|R
5000|$|Armed with AK-47s and RPGs, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> {{attacked}} <b>the</b> town on two {{armored personnel}} carriers, {{stolen from the}} Nigerian military several months ago, motorcycles and pick-up trucks. The attack occurred in the night when some residents were still sleeping. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> opened fire on the people at a busy market that was open at night when temperatures cool. Having set homes ablaze, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> gunned down residents who tried {{to escape from the}} fire.|$|R
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom {{deemed the}} Rhodesian {{declaration}} {{an act of}} rebellion, but did not re-establish control by force. A guerrilla war subsequently ensued when Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated guerilla operations against Rhodesia's predominantly white government. ZAPU {{was supported by the}} Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a Marxist–Leninist ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a referendum the previous year, but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> nationalists.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
50|$|Israeli {{security}} forces conducted negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>militants.</b> One hostage, Kochava Levy, became a mediator between the {{security forces}} and militants, as she spoke Arabic. During the negotiations, Levy provided {{the security forces}} detailed information on <b>the</b> <b>militants.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>militants</b> then {{expanded}} their {{base of operations}} and moved into the neighboring Swat Valley and imposed a very harsh Sharia law on the scenic valley. The Army launched an offensive to re-take the Swat Valley in 2007 {{but was unable to}} clear it of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> who had fled into the mountains and waited for the Army to leave to take over the valley again. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> then launched another wave of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|Since the afternoon, {{the army}} kept asking <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> to surrender, using the public address system. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> {{were asked to}} send the pilgrims out of the temple {{premises}} to safety, before they started fighting the army. However, nothing happened till 7 PM. General Brar then asked the police, if they could send emissaries inside to help get the civilians out, but the police said that anyone sent inside would be killed by <b>the</b> <b>militants.</b> They believed that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> were keeping <b>the</b> pilgrims inside to stop the army from entering the temple. Finally, around a hundred sick and old people were let out. These people informed the army that the others were not being allowed to come out.|$|R
5|$|The game's story {{takes place}} {{primarily}} at —a bird-only high school {{located in the}} fictional Japanese town of —long after open warfare between humans and birds has ended. Society has adjusted to the avian conquest, though with minor bird-related cultural changes—for example, while some holidays such as Christmas and Tanabata are celebrated much {{as they are in}} the present day, a major event in the game is Legumentine's Day, an amalgamation of the traditions of Valentine's Day and Setsubun. In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E
5|$|ZAPU members {{attempted}} to bomb or burn down {{the houses of}} blacks who joined or supported white-led political parties, {{as well as the}} churches they attended. Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence. In an attempt to restore confidence in the government and end the political intimidation, Smith cracked down hard on <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> nationalists, arresting political agitators in the townships for criminal offences and jailing ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo in Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp, a remote detention unit in the country's south-east. The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E
5|$|A Xhosa, Mandela {{was born}} in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became {{involved}} in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for {{his involvement in the}} 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. In 1962, he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.|$|E

5000|$|The implied {{criticism}} here is {{that while}} <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> were busy telling other black people how they should live to improve their lives, the black church communities were busy making black communities better. In stanzas 1 -5, Rodgers notes that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> {{try to change the}} hair styles, the dress, any association with whites, the food eaten by blacks, and what <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> termed [...] "white man's religion." [...] According to Friedrike Kaufel, these changes [...] "are petty ones." [...] These changes were quietly and passively resisted by the church members, who continued [...] "going to church" [...] and [...] "tithing and building and praying."

50|$|A {{variety of}} army units along with {{paramilitary}} forces, {{led by the}} General Kuldip Brar, surrounded the temple complex on 3 June 1984. The army kept asking <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> to surrender, using the public address system. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> were not asked to send the pilgrims out of the temple premises to safety, before they started fighting the army.

5|$|A {{former member}} of the Conservative Party and the libertarian {{organisation}} Libertas, Gjems-Onstad joined Anders Lange's Party when it was founded in 1973 and became the party's deputy leader. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the 1973 parliamentary election, and became the party's parliamentary leader following Anders Lange's death in 1974. Many of his views and proposals caused controversy, and he got in conflict with the new leadership of the party, which was eventually headed by Carl I. Hagen. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the party in 1976, and finished his term as an independent. He also became known for criticising the Norwegian government's policy in Africa, and for defending the governments of countries such as Rhodesia and South Africa. In the 1980s he worked as a defender for several anti-immigration activists, and from the late 1980s he became involved in anti-immigration politics himself. He stood in election for the Stop Immigration party in 1989 and for the Fatherland Party in 1991, and he was later involved in <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> organisation Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring ("Peoples movement against immigration") and later Stop Islamisation of Norway. He was briefly active locally in the Conservative Party and the Pensioners' Party in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the actions}} of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", {{abbreviated}} MK). Becoming chairman of <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara {{as well as from the}} military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|Tarnovo was {{captured}} by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about {{the fall of the}} Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and {{a small portion of the}} Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum Millet, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas, as well as in <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country.|$|E
50|$|At 6:30 pm local time, {{three men}} {{disguised}} in police uniforms created a distraction while a fourth man entered the hotel compound to detonate his suicide vest. Taliban spokesman Zadihullah Mujahid claimed that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> had been armed with AK-47 automatic rifles, hand grenades and explosive jackets. After {{a car bomb}} had detonated outside <b>the</b> hotel, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> began firing around inside the compound. According to a NATO spokesman, one of the compound guards managed to kill one of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> before they entered the hotel.|$|R
50|$|Two of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> threw {{hand grenades}} at the guards outside, then entered the hotel complex itself. As {{they entered the}} hotel, one of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> detonated a suicide vest, while at least one other, who was wearing an Afghan police uniform, began firing an AK-47.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> were killed, a {{large crowd}} of locals {{gathered}} around the building. The police and IDF forces at the site failed to stop them as the angry residents entered the apartment and threw the bodies of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> out <b>the</b> window. The angry mob poured petrol on the bodies and torched them. The body {{of one of the}} victims was accidentally lit as well. The maltreatment of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> bodies was later on condemned by the Minister Shimon Peres and Rabbi Shlomo Goren who participated in the funerals of the victims.|$|R
