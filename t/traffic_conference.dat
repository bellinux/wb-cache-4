Having been raped by her captor, she recalled the destructive impact of exposure to sexual education programs where a sexually active girl is compared to a chewed piece of gum. [...] "I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm that chewed up piece of gum, nobody re-chews a piece of gum, you throw it away.' And that's {{how easy it is to}} feel like you no longer have worth, you no longer have value," [...] Smart said. [...] "Why would it even be worth screaming out? Why would it even make a difference if you are rescued? Your life still has no value." [...] Smart went on to ask that listeners educate children on having self-worth, and how to avoid becoming a victim.|$|R
40|$|While inter-cell {{interference}} coordination (ICIC) for the downlink and uplink of multi-cell systems (in general) and orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiple access (OFDMA) networks (in particular) have been extensively studied, {{the study of the}} impact caused by inter-cell interference with video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic</b> has received less attention. The consideration of video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic</b> is essential for analyzing the overall performance analysis of inter-cell interference in LTE networks, and in particular for the evaluation of the video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic.</b> In LTE networks, the same frequencies can be used in several adjacent cells. This means that in practice every cell may have other cell nearby whose radio transmissions may interfere with the own signal. In this paper, we report a comprehensive analysis on the performance of video traffic considering the inter-cell interference impact in LTE network. The interference patterns are configured by using the OPNET simulator for a given set of parameters, such as cell configuration, user configurations, and traffic models. The interference pattern is used to study the performance of video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic</b> in LTE network for realistic deployments. We, present {{a detailed description of the}} way to model the network in OPNET platform considering the inter-cell interference. In order to use the suggested network model in OPNET platform three network scenarios are configured. They are fully overlapped, half overlapped and no frequency overlapping. These scenarios are configured in such a way to show how the video traffic is impacted when the network load increases. The thesis shows that the video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic</b> experiences more delay and loss when fully overlapped frequency is used in the adjacent cell on LTE network.

40|$|Aetive {{technology}} {{is emerging as}} one of the most promising fields in networking and distributed computing. It permits customized and more flexible control over the underlying networks. End users can systematically and strategically study and change the network behaviors by programming individual nodes of the network. The functionality of an adive network goes beyond the traditional data transmission; each node of an active network has the ability to executing certain programs (or commands) passing through it. This paper describes our research work of applying active technology to video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic</b> control. We present the architecture and the design of an application-level facility, called active gateway, for video <b>conferencing</b> <b>traffic</b> and quality of servlce (QoS) control. We show that this facility enables more control functions for video conferencing which are not seen in conventional video conferencing tools. We illustrate its features through several experiments. Many important issues related to the design of an active network are discussed. Some technical solutions and future improvement are suggested. ...|$|R
