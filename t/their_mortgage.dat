25|$|The bank {{planned to}} repay the {{government}} debt within three to four years, primarily by encouraging mortgage customers to take <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> to another lender. Costs were also reduced by reducing numbers of staff. As of 3 March 2009, the bank was repaying the loan well ahead of target, owing a net balance of only £8.9billion of the loan which stood at £26.9billion {{at the end of}} 2007.|$|E
25|$|On 23 February 2009, Northern Rock {{announced}} {{that they would be}} offering £14billion worth of new mortgages, over the next two years, as a part of their new business plan. This new lending was partly funded by an increase in the government loan and a reversal of previous strategy to pay the loan off as quickly as possible by actively encouraging mortgage customers to leave when <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> deal matured. The reason for this change was government policy to increase the availability of credit. This £14billion was to be split into £5billion in 2009 and £9billion in 2010.|$|E
25|$|While the {{previous}} decades concerned the private {{ownership of the}} Fort, the mid-twentieth century was focused upon reclaiming the land for public use. The first incident was in 1917 when an issue over unpaid back taxes resulted {{in the town of}} Amherstburg seizing a small area of privately owned land known as the Webber property and then turning over ownership of it to the Federal government. In the 1930s, the Cleveland Cliffs Iron and Coal Company were persuaded not to renew <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> on the north section of the northeast bastion, which resulted in the town purchasing the land and then turning it over to the Department of Mines and Resources National Parks Division. After the death of Franklin A. Hough in 1946, the Federal government purchased Lot 4. Additionally, in 1958, the Federal government repeated the same action with the McGregor House, purchasing it from his estate.|$|E

50|$|As the Federal Reserve Bank applied its {{monetary}} contraction {{policy in}} 2005, many homeowners were stunned when <b>their</b> adjustable-rate <b>mortgages</b> began to reset to much higher rates in mid-2007 and their monthly payments jumped far above {{their ability to}} meet the monthly mortgage payments. Some homeowners began defaulting on <b>their</b> <b>mortgages</b> in mid-2007, and {{the cracks in the}} U.S. housing foundation became apparent.|$|R

25|$|The {{damage to}} S {{operations}} led Congress to act, passing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in August 1981 and initiating the regulatory changes by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board allowing S to sell <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans {{and use the}} cash generated to seek better returns soon after enactment; the losses created by the sales were to be amortized {{over the life of}} the loan, and any losses could also be offset against taxes paid over the preceding ten years. This all made S eager to sell their loans. The buyers – major Wall Street firms – were quick to take advantage of the S' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees. S were one group buying these bonds, holding $150 billion by 1986, and being charged substantial fees for the transactions.|$|E
500|$|Reid's ideas, however, [...] "were prosaic in the extreme". [...] His {{promotions}} included printing {{the sports}} section on green newsprint and a pocket-sized magazine for television listings that initially stopped the Sunday paper's circulation skid, but proved an empty product. [...] The Tribune turned a profit in 1956, but the Times was rapidly outpacing it in news content, circulation, and ad revenue. [...] The promotions largely failed {{to hold on to}} the Tribunes new audiences; the Sunday edition began to slide again and the paper fell into the red in 1957. Through the decade, the Tribune was the only newspaper in the city to see its share of ad lineage drop, and longtime veterans of the paper, including Bigart, began departing. The Reids, who had by now turned <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> into stock, began seeking buyers to infuse the Tribune with cash, turning to John Hay [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney, whose family had a long association with the Reids. [...] Whitney, recently named ambassador to Great Britain, had chaired Dwight Eisenhower's fundraising campaigns in 1952 and 1956 and was looking for something else to engage him beyond his largely ceremonial role in Great Britain. [...] Whitney, who [...] "did not want the Tribune to die", gave the newspaper $1.2 million over the objections of his investment advisors, who had doubts about the newspaper's viability. The loan came with the option to take controlling interest of the newspaper if he made a second loan of $1.3 million. [...] Brown Reid expected the $1.2 million to cover a deficit that would last through the end of 1958, but by that year the newspaper's loss was projected at $3 million, and Whitney and his advisors decided to exercise their option. The Reids, claiming to have put $20 million into the newspaper since the 1924 merger [...] initially attempted to keep editorial control of the paper, but Whitney made it clear he would not invest additional money in the Tribune if the Reids remained at the helm. [...] The family yielded, and Helen, Whitie and Brown Reid announced Whitney's takeover of the newspaper on August 28, 1958. The Reids retained a substantial stake in the Tribune until its demise, but Whitney and his advisors controlled the paper.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{fell behind}} in its {{payments}} {{on the debt}} {{to the bank and}} Davis.

5000|$|This {{major and}} {{unexpected}} decline in house prices meant that many borrowers have zero or negative equity in their homes, meaning their homes were {{worth less than}} <b>their</b> <b>mortgages.</b> As of March 2008, an estimated 8.8 million borrowers — 10.8% of all homeowners — had negative equity in their homes, a number that {{is believed to have}} risen to 12 million by November 2008. Borrowers in this situation have an incentive to [...] "walk away" [...] from <b>their</b> <b>mortgages</b> and abandon <b>their</b> homes, even though doing so will damage their credit rating for a number of years.|$|R

40|$|Even as {{home sales}} prices {{increase}} {{in some parts}} of New York City and a loud and increasing buzz around a supposedly revitalized housing market ensues, there continue to be over 60, 000 homeowners in crisis. These families, concentrated in predominantly African-American and Latino low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, continue to live in a precarious world where the values of their homes are less than the outstanding balances on <b>their</b> <b>mortgages.</b> These families are living underwater. Many of them continue to pay and remain current on <b>their</b> <b>mortgages</b> despite extenuating economic circumstances. But increasingly, more and more families cannot continue to pay <b>their</b> inflated <b>mortgage</b> premiums and are at risk of defaulting and entering the foreclosure process.

[...] While banks are allowed to charge homeowners for such appraisals, Wells Fargo frequently charged homeowners $95 to $125 on appraisals for which the bank had been charged $50 or less. [...] The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act on grounds that sending invoices and statements with fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.|$|E
2500|$|In late February media sources began {{reporting}} that {{a section of}} the bank was to become a [...] "good bank", issuing more mortgages, when it is injected with £10-14 billion by the Government.

The company gave notice of intent to terminate the lease agreement with Jackpot in February 1996, in accordance with the terms, owing to monthly loss of revenue on a consistent basis. Gambling operations discontinued as of March 31, 1996. By December 31, 1996, the company was in default, unable to make principal and interest payments on <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> Payroll taxes of approximately $1,063,000, along with other accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately $3,643,000, were also in default.|$|E
2500|$|Mortgage {{payments}} from homeowners are deposited into a locally administered [...] "Fund for Humanity", {{the proceeds of}} which go toward future construction. In an effort to discourage predatory lenders from targeting Habitat homeowner families, mortgage agreements require the Habitat for Humanity affiliate the right of first refusal. Until the mortgage is paid in full, a Habitat home has no equity and can only be sold back to Habitat for Humanity. Should a homeowner family decide to sell their home {{during the period of}} <b>their</b> <b>mortgage,</b> the affiliate will buy it back at market value. Often affiliates will have a shared appreciation model that will allow the affiliate to recapture a portion of the equity in the home depending on the time the family lived in the home and paid on the mortgage.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Mervin Wendell has grown rich selling {{marginal}} land to naive immigrants and easterners for dryland farming, lending on the land at extortion rates then foreclosing and reselling the land at a profit. [...] Though the secret of his family's success still haunts the now grown up Philip (Morgan Paull), he continues the family real estate business often mercilessly foreclosing on unsuccessful farmers. Among those are young Iowans Earl and Alice Grebe (Claude Jarman, Jr. and Julie Sommars). [...] Despite warnings from Hans Brumbaugh and Jim Lloyd, the Grebes settle on the drylands of the prairie and take out a mortgage with Mervin Wendell. [...] This gamble on marginal land soon turns disastrous as the Dust Bowl years of the 1920s and 1930s and a freefall in wheat prices after World War I set in.

2500|$|Limited {{redevelopment}} {{efforts have}} occurred in Marshall Heights since 1990. [...] In 1989, the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization (MHCDO) secured financing from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and purchased four empty lots on the 5300 block of Drake Place SE. The MHCDO built four houses there and sold them to low-income families. But many homes in the neighborhood were still in poor condition. As late as 1995, Marshall Heights still contained a number of home-made houses with sheet metal roofs. Most of the notorious Eastgate Gardens was razed in 1998, and the remainder in 2002. A new public housing development, Glenncrest, opened on the site in 2008. In 2010, the nonprofit National Housing Trust purchased Copeland Manor (Benning Road SE, C Street SE, and 49th Street SE), a 61-unit apartment building. The apartment building became a cooperative, and National Housing Trust agreed to a lease-to-buy arrangement with the tenants' cooperative. In 2011, the city took title to the Bass Circle Apartments (Benning Road SE, B Street SE, and Bass Place SE), a five-building, 119-unit apartment complex whose owners had defaulted on <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> The tenants partnered with Bass Apartments LLC, a subsidiary of Telesis Corp., to obtain a $4.843 million loan and rehabilitate the complex.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{entering}} office, Obama {{focused on}} handling {{the global financial}} crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The tax provisions of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second stimulus bill passed. Obama also launched a second bailout of US automakers, possibly saving General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy {{at the cost of}} $9.3 billion. For homeowners in danger of defaulting on <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013. Short-term interest rates remained near zero for much of Obama's presidency, and the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates during Obama's presidency until December 2015.|$|E
