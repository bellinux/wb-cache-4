5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
50|$|When {{the voltage}} across the {{capacitor}} reaches b, the breakdown voltage of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> Vb, <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> turns on and its resistance drops {{to a low}} value. The charge on the capacitor discharges rapidly through <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> in a momentary pulse of current (c). When the voltage drops to the extinction voltage Ve of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> (d), <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> turns off and the current through it drops to a low level (a). The current through the resistor begins charging the capacitor up again, and the cycle repeats.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth longest-lasting {{light bulb}} {{is located in}} a fire house in Mangum, Oklahoma. <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> is not {{attached}} to any special electrical supply, and when the power goes off, so does <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b> <b>The</b> firefighters in Mangum are willing to show people <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> as long as they're not busy with something else.|$|R
5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with <b>the</b> bulb; <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> into <b>the</b> new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar <b>the</b> <b>bulb's</b> continuous burning record. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>bulb's</b> 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|R
5|$|When flower heads have died, {{removing}} (deadheading) {{them will}} allow more energy {{to build up}} <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> and strengthen the following years' display.|$|E
5|$|By 1636 the tulip bulb {{became the}} fourth leading export {{product of the}} Netherlands, after gin, {{herrings}} and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among people who never saw <b>the</b> <b>bulbs.</b> Many men made and lost fortunes overnight.|$|E
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{flexible}} <b>bulb</b> has a plug {{that can}} be opened to pour off collected fluid. Each time fluid is removed, the patient, caregiver or healthcare provider squeezes {{the air out of}} <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> and replaces <b>the</b> plug before releasing <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b> <b>The</b> resulting vacuum creates suction in the drainage tubing, which gradually draws fluid from the surgical site into <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> may be repeatedly opened to remove the collected fluid and squeezed again to restore suction. It is best to empty drains before they are more than half full to avoid the discomfort of the weight of the drain pulling on the internal tubing.|$|R
40|$|A storage bulb for {{an atomic}} {{hydrogen}} maser {{is produced by}} coating its internal surface with an emulsion containing both TFE and FEP particles. The emulsion is produced by mixing a first quantity of TFE in an aqueous dispersion with a second quantity of FEP in an aqueous dispersion, with a third quantity of distilled water. The emulsion is poured into <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> to coat it uniformly so as to form a thin film of emulsion on <b>the</b> <b>bulb's</b> internal surface. After excess emulsion is drained out of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>the</b> emulsion in <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is dried to remove the water {{and most of the}} aqueous matter therefrom. The remaining emulsion is then cured by heating <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> to a temperature of at least 380 C...|$|R
50|$|This {{area is the}} {{southern}} part of a larger flower-growing area called <b>the</b> <b>Bulb</b> Region (Bollenstreek). However, {{it is not unusual for}} <b>the</b> Dune and <b>Bulb</b> Region itself to be referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Bulb</b> Region.|$|R
5|$|Bluebells {{synthesise}} a {{wide range}} of chemicals with potential medicinal properties. They contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that may provide them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble alkaloids – are similar to compounds tested for use in combating HIV and cancer. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a remedy for leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.|$|E
5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E
5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{intensity}} of UV radiation emitted by <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> eye protection is suggested when using a deuterium bulb. Care {{must also be taken}} to avoid touching <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> directly to avoid burns due to high operating temperatures. Touching <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> directly even when cool can smudge the casing and therefore reduce output intensity.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulb's</b> [...] "turn on" [...] voltage Vb {{is higher}} than its [...] "turn off" [...] voltage Ve. This property, called hysteresis, allows <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> to {{function}} as an oscillator. Hysteresis is due to <b>the</b> <b>bulb's</b> negative resistance, <b>the</b> fall in voltage with increasing current after breakdown, which is a property of all gas discharge lamps.|$|R
50|$|Pressure-equalizing {{dropping}} funnels have {{an additional}} narrow-bore glass tube from <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> of <b>the</b> funnel, {{to the ground}} glass joint around the stem. These replace the liquid volume lost in <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> with <b>the</b> equivalent gas volume from the flask into which the reagent is flowing, and are useful when handling air-sensitive reagents in a sealed, inert-gas environment. Without this tube, or some other means to equalize the pressure between a sealed receiving flask and <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> of <b>the</b> funnel, the flow of fluid from <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> will rapidly come to a halt.|$|R
5|$|In the United Kingdom, H.non-scripta is a {{protected}} species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Landowners {{are prohibited from}} removing common bluebells on their land for sale {{and it is a}} criminal offence to remove <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> of wild common bluebells. This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, punishable by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb. The species is not protected in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> on <b>the</b> {{left has}} a CRI of 80. <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> on <b>the</b> right has a CRI of 92. An {{incandescent}} bulb has a CRI of 100.|$|R
50|$|For {{the test}} 4 grams {{of the sample}} are put into a weighed glass <b>bulb.</b> <b>The</b> sample in <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is heated in a bath at 553°C for 20 minutes. After cooling <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is weighed again and the {{difference}} noted.|$|R
5000|$|Tata Swach <b>Bulb</b> is <b>the</b> main purifying {{unit of the}} product. <b>The</b> Swach <b>Bulb,</b> {{depending}} on <b>the</b> quality of water, can purify about 3000 L of water, after which <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> must be replaced. <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> has a [...] "fuse" [...] indicating when a cartridge change is required.|$|R
5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. He talks about his stage fright and goes off on a tangent about <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of the audience to stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are load-bearing. He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the mirror, as he does not wear make-up.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
50|$|The {{major problem}} with this method is that {{in one of the}} four switch {{combinations}} the socket around <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is electrified at both of its terminals even though <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> itself is not lit. As the shell may be energized, even with the light switched off, this poses a risk of electrical shock when changing <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b> This method is therefore prohibited in modern building wiring.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Edison {{designed}} a bulb {{that was supposed}} to last forever, called the Eternal Light, and turned it on on October 22, 1929. <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> is located in the Memorial Tower at the Edison Memorial Museum in Menlo Park, New Jersey. The tower fell down in 1937, but <b>the</b> <b>bulb's</b> power was supposedly uninterrupted, according to General Electric, and <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> continued to burn while a second tower was constructed. However, according to museum curator Jack Stanley, <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is fake, consisting of a hollow bulb illuminated by a series of automobile headlights mounted in the display's base.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> dormant <b>bulb</b> {{which is}} to be twin-scaled has its surface sterilized by {{removing}} its dry tunic and carefully trimming off its roots and any dead tissue, while leaving a layer of sound basal plate intact, then dipping <b>the</b> clean <b>bulb</b> in dilute bleach (or another suitable disinfectant). <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> is then sliced cleanly from top to bottom several times, creating 8 or 16 segments, {{depending on the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b> At this stage the segments are called [...] "chips" [...] (many growers are content with simply chipping a bulb into 4 or 8 and do not divide <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> further).|$|R
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged to buy <b>the</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The decree changed {{the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
25|$|When {{the base}} of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is not made to be flame-retardant, as {{required}} in the voluntary standard for CFLs, overheating of the electrical components in <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> may create a fire hazard.|$|R
50|$|If R is too small, {{the load}} line will cross the IV curve between c and d. In this region the current through R is too large; once <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> has turned on, the current through R will {{be large enough}} to keep it {{conducting}} without current from the capacitor, and the voltage across <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> will never fall to Ve so <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> will never turn off.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> palpal <b>bulb</b> of {{a mature}} male spider is borne {{on the last}} segment of the pedipalp. This segment usually has touch-sensitive hairs (setae) with nerves leading to them. <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> itself is entirely without nerves, and hence without sensory organs and muscles, since these depend on nerves for their functioning, {{although}} some spiders {{have one or two}} muscles external to <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> and connected to it by tendons. <b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> contains a tube or duct, usually coiled, open near the tip of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> and closed at the other end, in which sperm is stored before being used to inseminate a female. The closed end may be expanded, forming a [...] "fundus". The tube usually opens via a narrow tip, the [...] "embolus".|$|R
