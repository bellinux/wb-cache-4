5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} investigating <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> the two {{agree to}} work together. They discover that Carver had used the GPS encoder to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet {{on their way to}} China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow a hole in the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{then took}} a {{petition}} to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up the matter on April 20, 1873 and voted 63 to 9 not to allow Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of quo warranto, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction in <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> dismissed the case. They gave a lengthy explanation {{as to why the}} General Assembly should decide contested gubernatorial elections in Joint Session, since they are the directly elected representatives of the people.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{broadcasting}} {{the series}} in Victoria, Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution. The first episode was made available on torrent sites within 20minutes of it concluding in New South Wales. The Nine Network reportedly obtained the IP address of {{the first person to}} upload the show, and network lawyers were considering legal action. The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was investigating <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police. Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online.|$|E

5|$|In 1291 Pope Nicholas IV sent {{a letter}} to Joachim III, dated 23 March, {{reminding}} the Bulgarian Patriarch of their old friendship and urging him to join the Roman Church. The Pope also {{sent a letter}} to George Terter I expressing his hope to see Bulgaria return to the authority of Rome, alluding to the union between Bulgaria and Rome concluded in 1205 during the reign of emperor Kaloyan. Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> the papal initiative failed to produce any tangible results.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and fogging on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E

40|$|A novel idea of {{the direct}} {{detection}} {{to search for a}} ultralight dark <b>matter</b> based on <b>the</b> interaction between <b>the</b> dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> a nucleon is proposed. Solar system bodies feel <b>the</b> dark <b>matter</b> wind <b>and</b> it acts as a resistant force opposing their motions. The astronomical ephemeris of solar system bodies is so precise that it has a strong capability to detect a dark matter whose mass is much lighter than O(1) eV. We have estimated the resistant force based on the calculation of the elastic scattering cross section between <b>the</b> dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bodies beyond the Born approximation, and show that the astronomical ephemeris indeed put a very strong constraint on the interaction between <b>the</b> dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> a nucleon, depending on how smoothly <b>the</b> ultralight dark <b>matter</b> is distributed at the scale smaller than the celestial bodies in our solar system.

5|$|In July 1676 Carbery {{called for}} a hearing against Morgan {{in front of the}} Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, {{during his}} visit to Yerevan, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that, after talking to the Armenian Chess Federation {{chairman}} Serzh Sargsyan (also President of Armenia), he heard no refusal about their participation. The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation Smbat Lputian responded that Armenia was still discussing <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> had not decided on the matter yet. In July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad.|$|E
5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed.

5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> the story died.|$|E

5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product.
