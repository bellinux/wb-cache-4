40|$|This article aims at {{analyzing}} {{the function of}} keris in <b>performing</b> <b>art.</b> Qualitative descriptive method {{was used in this}} study. The theoretical concept referred to is focused on the Malinowski’s perspective that functional analysis gives emphasis on the principles that every type of civilization, customs and traditions has particular important functions. In addition, they also have their own responsibilities and cannot be separated from the whole system. The fact shows that keris in community life, which basically used {{to be used as a}} stabbing tool, has been preserved as a heirloom. In addition, its function has also been developed in <b>the</b> performance of <b>performing</b> <b>art,</b> in which its function is closely related to the system of characterization. It functions to strengthen, characterize and represent the characteristics of the character. In <b>the</b> <b>performing</b> <b>art,</b> it functions as 1) equipment or property; 2) the character’s identity; 3) part of dressing; and 4) the symbol of power and source of strength. Its functions in <b>the</b> <b>performing</b> <b>art</b> are unconditional in nature; however, they are related to each other. Its forms and functions are classified in order to obtain more adequate, detailed and deep understanding of how keris cannot be separated from <b>the</b> <b>performing</b> <b>art.</b> <b>The</b> degree of understanding of to what extent keris functions in <b>the</b> <b>performing</b> <b>art</b> is a reality and indicates the fact that keris is worth exploring and such an exploration is useful to the world of knowledge.
