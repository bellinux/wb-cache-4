25|$|In {{the decades}} since 5/4 GR {{first arrived in}} Bakloh, in 1963, Bakloh has lost its sheen, and the officer and {{the men of the}} Regiment appear no longer as keen on Bakloh {{as they were in the}} fifties. <b>They</b> <b>complain</b> that it is on a limb, and small and boring. As a result of the {{constant}} gripe against Bakloh, it has lost its 'asterisk' status. This is a cause of big disappointment for the 4 GR pensioners in Bakloh. Many older officers, Junior Commissioned Officers(JCOs), and men, especially those who started their regimental careers in Bakloh, are unaffected by those who grumble about Bakloh, and remain fond and attachment to Bakloh; and committed to the idea that Bakloh should have a Battalion from the Regiment to sustain the Bakloh legacy and take care of the regimental properties, remains, and the sizeable population of regiment's pensioners, and widows.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{a stroke}} {{affecting}} the right parietal lobe {{of the brain}} can lead to neglect for {{the left side of}} the visual field, causing a patient with neglect to behave as if the left side of sensory space is nonexistent (although they can still turn left). In an extreme case, a patient with neglect might fail to eat the food on the left half of their plate, even though <b>they</b> <b>complain</b> of being hungry. If someone with neglect is asked to draw a clock, their drawing might show only the numbers 12 to 6, or all 12 numbers might be on one half of the clock face with the other half distorted or blank. Neglect patients may also ignore the contralesional side of their body; for instance, they might only shave, or apply make-up to, the non-neglected side. These patients may frequently collide with objects or structures such as door frames on the side being neglected.|$|E

Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their boss, Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when <b>they</b> <b>complain</b> that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|E

Further she claims that if <b>they</b> <b>complain,</b> they are punished, and that if <b>they</b> <b>complain</b> over the treatment of other prisoners, they are punished even harder.
