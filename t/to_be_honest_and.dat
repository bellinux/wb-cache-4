Paul Williams worked with the duo at Henson Recording Studios, the former studio of A Records where he had worked previously, including his compositions for Jim Henson's films featuring the Muppets, such as [...] "Rainbow Connection". He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung {{from the point of}} view of an unidentified first person, setting the emotion, but the lyrics came from the music itself. Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record, and said he writes best when he is allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> vulnerable, a situation that Daft Punk allowed. He also stated that his sobriety added a sense of wonder to the song he wrote, as every day for him being sober has been wonderful compared to his prior life of excess.|$|E

Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled".

The writers dealt with it [...] "sensibly" [...] because Frank and Roo {{make up their own}} minds. She added {{that it was important to}} let teenagers show their maturity if they want to marry. Roo keeps her baby's paternity a secret until the wedding day. In the middle of exchanging vows, Roo decides <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> tells Frank the truth. A wedding scenario had been planned for Roo, by the serial's writing team from the off-set. Bateman said that the wedding was not just to attract more viewers. He opined that people think that weddings were always based on the [...] "consummation of love". Roo and Frank's wedding highlighted that it does not always work that way.

500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are and get up, forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life".|$|E

500|$|Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early {{relationship}} to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not {{so much of}} tension, but rather constant antagonism". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> talk how you feel." [...] Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E
