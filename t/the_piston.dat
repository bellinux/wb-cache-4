5|$|The {{quality of}} the {{original}} design was such that No. A866 was put {{on display at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934. This was when the SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to standardise components between the batches. The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke deflectors to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass type on the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> tail rods on the earlier batches, created a truly standardised appearance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} no records as to the designs of the early steam engines {{produced}} by the Mars Works, Evans's most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture, it {{would prove to be}} the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together {{at one end of the}} machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design. This significantly cut the running cost to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> {{moves in}} and out, the seal drags and {{stretches}} on <b>the</b> <b>piston,</b> causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> {{is allowed to}} move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, {{eliminating the need for}} return springs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pistons</b> {{are made}} from an {{aluminum}} alloy designed to withstand high temperatures. An indentation is incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> to prevent <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> from hitting <b>the</b> valves if the timing belt breaks. <b>Piston</b> pins holding <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> in place are locked by snap rings.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pistons</b> trailed <b>the</b> Lakers 41 - 40 at halftime, but a 10 - 4 surge {{capped by}} Billups's 3-pointer gave <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> <b>the</b> lead. O'Neal's foul trouble furthered the scoring gap, with <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> leading by 13 points {{early in the}} fourth quarter.|$|R
50|$|On July 20, 2015, Anthony re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Pistons.</b> On February 18, 2016, Anthony {{was traded}} to the Philadelphia 76ers in a three-team trade {{involving}} <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> and <b>the</b> Houston Rockets, where Anthony and a 2017 second-round pick went to Philadelphia, Donatas Motiejūnas and Marcus Thornton to Detroit, and the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum and a 2016 first-round pick to Houston. However, four days later, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> rescinded their trade following a failed physical by Motiejūnas, forcing Anthony to return to <b>the</b> <b>Pistons.</b> On July 10, 2016, he was waived by <b>the</b> <b>Pistons.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>piston</b> in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> to lift off the stationary valve seat as <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> slides into the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E
25|$|When {{one side}} of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> {{is open to the}} atmosphere, the {{operation}} is slightly different. As the sealed volume of working gas comes in contact with the hot side, it expands, doing work on both <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and on the atmosphere. When the working gas contacts the cold side, its pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the atmosphere pushes on <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and does work on the gas.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{before the}} space {{on one side}} of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> starts to contract, the valve starts to release steam from that space to the atmosphere, so as not to impede the {{movement}} of <b>the</b> <b>piston.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{vibration}} free fluid compressor particularly {{adapted for}} Stirling cycle cryogenic refrigeration apparatus comprises {{a pair of}} identical opposing ferromagnetic pistons located in a housing and between a gas spring including a sealed volume of a working fluid such as gas under pressure. The gas compresses and expands in accordance with movement of <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> to generate a compression wave which can be vented to other apparatus, for example, a displacer unit in a Stirling cycle engine. <b>The</b> <b>pistons</b> are urged outwardly due to {{the pressure of the}} gas; however, a fixed electromagnetic coil assembly located in the housing adjacent <b>the</b> <b>pistons,</b> is periodically energized to produce a magnetic field which interlinks <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> in such a fashion that <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> are mutually attracted to one another. The mass of <b>the</b> <b>pistons,</b> in conjunction with the compressed gas between them, form a naturally resonant system which, when <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> are electromagnetically energized, produces an oscillating compression wave in the entrapped fluid medium...|$|R

25|$|Breton musician, teacher, and luthier Youenn Le Bihan invented <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> in 1983. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> is a {{contemporary}} {{development of the}} hautboy or baroque oboe, influenced by the bombard.

50|$|On June 3, 2014, Bower {{was named}} {{the general manager of}} <b>the</b> Detroit <b>Pistons.</b> On June 13, 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> signed Bower to a {{contract}} extension. Under Bower, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> reached <b>the</b> playoffs in his second season as GM.|$|R
25|$|He won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award four times, {{a record}} {{he shares with}} Dikembe Mutombo. In nine seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> (2000–2006; 2009–2012), Wallace made two NBA Finals {{appearances}} (2004 and 2005) and won a championship with <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>Pistons</b> retired his jersey number 3 in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|To replace Ben Wallace, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> signed Nazr Mohammed. He {{struggled}} {{to fill the}} team's void at center, however, and the team began looking for additional help. On January 16, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> signed free agent Chris Webber. <b>The</b> <b>Pistons</b> quickly began playing better basketball. They were only 21-15 before Webber was acquired; with him, the team went 32-14. On April 11, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> clinched <b>the</b> {{best record in the}} Eastern Conference, which guaranteed them home-court advantage for first three rounds of the playoffs.|$|R
25|$|Steam {{was drawn}} from the boiler to the {{cylinder}} under <b>the</b> <b>piston.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> {{reached the top of}} the cylinder, the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> down the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{that the}} driver has {{adjusted}} the reversing lever such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon has no {{gas system}} and the {{internal}} components have been modified accordingly. The bolt carrier with integral charging handle was recycled from the AK, but <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> rod and rotary bolt were removed and <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> extension was plugged with a steel insert. The return spring and guide rod are identical {{to those of the}} AK.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 2009, Wallace {{agreed to}} re-sign with <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> {{as a free}} agent to a one-year deal. He {{formerly}} wore jersey number 3 with <b>the</b> <b>Pistons,</b> but changed his jersey to No. 6 upon his return, allowing Rodney Stuckey to keep that number.

50|$|During {{his first}} year as head coach, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> {{finished}} with a 43-29 record, and {{first place in the}} Western Division. During the 1955 NBA Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> lost a hard-fought seven-game to the Syracuse Nationals. The first-year head coach was honored as NBA Coach of the Year. The following season, Eckman lead <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> to another trip to the NBA Finals, where <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> fell to <b>the</b> Philadelphia Warriors, 4-1. In his third season as head coach, Eckman lead <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> to <b>the</b> playoffs, where they lost to the Minneapolis Lakers in the semifinals. During the 1957-58 season, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit, Michigan. Unfortunately for Eckman, his stay in Detroit didn't last long. He was relieved of his coaching duties just 25 games into the season following a 9-16 start. Eckman's overall coaching record was 123-118. He eventually returned to officiating.|$|R
50|$|An {{exciting}} signing for <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> in 2011 was former Harbour Heat big man and New Zealand Breakers development player B. J. Anthony. The {{first of}} the import signings for <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> was former Louisville star Jerry Smith, who had recently played in the NBA Development League for the Springfield Armor. The second was Fresno State standout Sylvester Seay. However, Seay was later released by <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> after not suiting coach Vickerman's style. Former import Jason Crowe subsequently stepped in to fill the Pistons' vacant import spot {{for the rest of}} <b>the</b> season. <b>The</b> <b>Pistons</b> also welcomed back swingman Thomas Abercrombie, big man Alex Pledger, live wire Ray Cameron, shooting guard Hayden Allen and solid sixth man Puke Lenden.

25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up in front of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> head pushes <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and bolt carrier rearward. As <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting {{for use in the}} presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 2015, Caldwell-Pope {{scored a}} then career-high 31 {{points in a}} 119-116 win over the Boston Celtics.

25|$|As the {{pressure}} increases, a point is reached where {{the pressure}} differential across the displacer rod becomes {{large enough to}} begin to push the displacer rod (and therefore also the displacer) towards <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and thereby collapsing the cold space and transferring the cold, compressed gas towards the hot side in an almost constant volume process. As the gas arrives in the hot side the pressure increases and begins to move <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> outwards to initiate the expansion step as explained in (1).|$|E

25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below <b>the</b> <b>piston,</b> keeping <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>piston.</b> The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|E
50|$|On January 14, 2015, Datome was {{assigned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> to <b>the</b> Grand Rapids Drive of the NBA Development League. On January 20, he was recalled by <b>the</b> <b>Pistons.</b>|$|R
