Beauchamp wanted to take action <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her</b> honor, but she was {{determined}} to act for herself. He began teaching her to shoot a gun. Learning that Sharp was in Bowling Green, Cooke sent him a letter condemning Beauchamp's attempt on his life and asking to see him again.

Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack the Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise.|$|E

5|$|In August 1955, Leech set an Australian {{record of}} 1 minute 5.0 seconds for the 110-yard freestyle, before {{lowering}} it to 1 minute 4.8 seconds in October; this prompted newspapers to trumpet {{her as a}} prospect for the Melbourne Olympics. She did not get an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her</b> Australian title in 1956 because she was hospitalised with illness. Leech recovered in time to win the national age title in the 100-metre freestyle {{in a time of}} 1 minute 4.6 seconds, just 0.1 of a second outside Dawn Fraser's world record. She then posted a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds to defeat Fraser and Lorraine Crapp at another meeting in the following month.|$|E

Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E
5|$|Faye and Joseph separate, {{and she and}} Linden begin a relationship. Faye {{discovers that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joseph's baby, but Linden promises to support her and they become briefly engaged. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their engagement. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her,</b> he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit.|$|E

Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Dušan the Mighty and the {{accession}} {{of his son}} Uroš the Weak, in December 1355, was soon followed by {{the breakup of the}} once-powerful and threatening Serbian Empire. It disintegrated into autonomous lordships that, by themselves, could not resist Bosnia. This paved the way for Tvrtko to expand towards the east, but internal problems prevented him from seizing the opportunity immediately. A lordship on Bosnia's eastern border was that of Vojislav Vojinović. When Vojislav attacked Ragusa, in 1361, the republic appealed to Tvrtko for help, but to no avail. Vojislav's widow Gojislava, ruling on behalf of their minor sons, provided Tvrtko with passage through the family's land during his struggle with Vuk, and Tvrtko remained cordial with the family. He was, however, unable <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her</b> from her nephew Nicholas Altomanović, who, by November 1368, had seized her sons' lands. All Tvrtko could do was help the dispossessed widow safely reach her native Albania.|$|E
50|$|In 1586, English sea captain Francis Drake plundered {{and burned}} St. Augustine, {{including}} a fortification that was under construction, while returning from raiding Santo Domingo and Cartagena in the Caribbean.

In 1590, a son by her husband's first marriage, Sir Domhnall Dubh O'Donnell, attempted to seize power but was defeated and killed in battle at Lug na Cnamh. Throughout this period she made repeated attempts to secure Red Hugh's release or escape from Dublin Castle.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} WWE Women's Championship, {{established in}} 1956, and the WWE Divas Championship, introduced in 2008, were unified on September 19, 2010, maintaining the title {{history of the}} Divas Championship. The older title was retired in favor of keeping the newer title as the sole championship contended for in WWE by the Divas. The self-professed co-Women's Champion Michelle McCool defeated Divas Champion Melina at Night of Champions to become the unified champion, thus making Layla the final holder of the Women's Championship. On April 3, 2016, at WrestleMania 32, Divas Champion Charlotte was originally scheduled <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her</b> title in a triple-threat match. At the event, however, the Divas Championship was replaced with a new WWE Women's Championship, with {{the winner of the}} triple-threat match becoming the inaugural champion, thus Charlotte was the final holder of the Divas Championship.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her.</b> The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Hilde is the {{daughter}} of the king of Wolfkrone, a fictional European kingdom under assault by series antagonist Nightmare's forces. After her father was driven insane by the Evil Seed event brought upon by the cursed sword Soul Edge (which took place seven years before the events of Soulcalibur IV), Hilde was forced to take the throne of Wolfkrone despite her young age. She took the responsibilities to protect her people and lead her armies in the front lines against Nightmare. As a desperate measure, Hilde seeks the Sword of Resurrection, Soul Calibur, to bring back an ancient king who once restored peace to the world. Eventually, both Nightmare and Soul Edge are destroyed for good by Soul Calibur, wielded by Hilde's friend, Siegfried, thus ending the long-term war. However, the Wolfkrone is still at turmoil, and Hilde must search for a new land for her people to settle. Throughout seventeen years, Hilde goes from nation to nation to search for territory, where she also became a mother of two children. Eventually, the Wolfkrone manages to find a land and live at peace, but Hilde is alarmed by Siegfried that an army of malfested have challenged wars upon the kingdom. Thus, Hilde allies herself with Siegfried's group of mercenaries, Schwarzwind, <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her</b> kingdom, regardless of the possibility that she might lose her life in the process.|$|E

5|$|When Pietro Cornaro died in 1388, Maria, unable <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>her</b> possessions, {{sold them}} to Venice on 12 December in {{exchange}} for an annual subsidy of 700 ducats. Before the Venetians could arrive {{to take over the}} two towns, however, the Byzantine Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos, and his ally and father-in-law Nerio I Acciaioli seized them with the aid of an Ottoman army under Evrenos. Although the Venetians were quickly able to oust Nerio from Nauplia, Argos, Kiveri and Thermisi remained in Theodore's hands until 11 June 1394, when he ceded them to Venice. After Maria's death in 1393, her uncle Engelbert—who had originally received the lordship in 1356—claimed her inheritance, but when the Venetians provided the document of sale, and suggested that {{they would be willing to}} cede the castles if he could pay for their defence and reimburse Venice for the costs of their purchase and the ongoing siege of Argos, he dropped his claim. Argos remained in Venetian hands until conquered by the Ottomans at the outbreak of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1463, while of all Venetian territories in the Morea, Nauplia persisted longest in her possession, and was surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540 after the conclusion of the Third Ottoman–Venetian War.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship.
