25|$|Construction of {{the first}} furnace {{commenced}} about August 1, 1839, at Biery's Port, later Catasauqua. <b>The</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hot blast were coal-fired, and the blowing engine was driven by a waterwheel tapping the canal at Lock 36. The furnace was blown in on July 3, 1840 and the first four tons of iron produced July 4, 1840. It remained in blast until flooded by a January freshet in 1841, producing 1,080 tons of iron during that period.|$|R

50|$|Ovens also vary in the {{way that}} they are controlled. <b>The</b> {{simplest}} <b>ovens</b> (<b>for</b> example, <b>the</b> AGA cooker) may not have any controls at all; <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> simply run continuously at various temperatures.

Set to the highest setting, this may also enable the broiler element. A timer may allow <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> to be turned on and off automatically at pre-set times. More sophisticated ovens may have complex, computer-based controls allowing a wide variety of operating modes and special features including the use of a temperature probe to automatically shut <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> off when <b>the</b> food is completely cooked to the desired degree.|$|R
40|$|Characteristics {{of sugar}} snap and {{chocolate}} chip cookies, and hazelnut biscuits made from refrigerated and frozen dough were studied. Doughs were stored at 4 °C for 6 weeks and at – 18 °C for 6 months, respectively.
