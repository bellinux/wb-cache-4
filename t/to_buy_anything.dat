5|$|Pearl's {{favorite}} {{activities are}} socializing at the Bikini Bottom Mall, and using her father's credit card <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> {{that is in}} style. Mr. Krabs disapproves of Pearl's prodigal spending, but nonetheless pays for her items to avoid disappointing his daughter. Pearl is employed as an assistant at Grandma's Apron, a store for elderly residents {{on the ground floor}} of the shopping center. Beatrice, her boss at Grandma's Apron, is voiced by actress Betty White.|$|E
5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The City of Her Dreams is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Ella Brown, who is sent {{to live with her}} aunt who living in a boarding house when her father heads to Alaska to prospect for gold. Ella's life at her aunt's home is miserable and she dreams of going to New York City. She dreams that she is in the city and has all money <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> which she fancies. Then she receives word that her father has returned from Alaska with a fortune and wants to give her everything she wants. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film includes scenes of New York City. The film was released on November 18, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

50|$|Three {{floors of}} shops mean that Sunshine City Plaza is a {{one-stop}} place <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> almost <b>anything.</b> The majority of shops are clothing shops, including such well-known labels as Levi's, Bauhaus, K-Swiss, Adidas, Giordano, and over fifty other shops, mostly specialising in women's fashion. Sunshine City Plaza also boasts a large 'Citistore' department store which sells many things: clothes, mattresses, beds, toys, electrical appliances, luggage and more.|$|R
25|$|In this theory, {{sovereign}} {{government is}} not financially constrained {{in its ability to}} spend; it is argued that the government can afford <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a debt ceiling law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E
25|$|Some items, such as {{clothes and}} children's toys, often become {{unwanted}} before they wear out due {{to changes in}} their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental freecycling organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the Red Cross, United Way, Salvation Army, and Goodwill which give these items to {{those who could not}} afford them new. Other organizations such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact, whose members promise not <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces landfill inline with the waste minimization program but can help raise money for a good cause.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{had many}} other duties: {{as well as}} acting as a bodyguard, he was sent <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> they needed, such as suits, boots, meals, or drinks. If Lennon said [...] "Socks, Mal", Evans would have to rush to a local store and buy pairs of cotton socks for him. In 1967, Evans wrote in his diaries that he [...] "bought Ringo [...] some undies for {{his visit to the}} doctor". Although Beatles' memorabilia is in {{continuous}} demand, a full set of autographs by all four could be forgeries: Evans and Aspinall used to sign many of them when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were too busy.|$|E

50|$|Kelly Richey {{was born}} and raised in Lexington, Kentucky, United States, in a {{conservative}} Christian household that avoided rock music. Her first instrument was the piano. Her second instrument was a drum kit that her neighbor let her take home. After a couple of months of playing drums in her bedroom, her father offered <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> her <b>anything</b> she wanted; she chose the guitar. She started learning guitar at age 15; she reached a point where she was practicing 12 hours a day.|$|R

Having {{forgotten}} <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> her <b>anything</b> {{and not wanting to}} upset her, Homer tells her that his present for her is outside; he then frantically rushes out to find a gift (sung to the tune of [...] "Trepak"). Every store is closed, and all Apu has at the Kwik-E-Mart is some jerky made out of trout. Homer searches in garbage cans, gutters, trees, and he even chases down Milhouse, but he cannot find anything.|$|R
500|$|Nursing {{during the}} war {{provided}} Olga and her sister Tatiana with exposure to experiences they had not previously had. The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital, women {{they would never have}} met if not for the war, and knew the names of their children and their family stories. On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store. Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month, and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and notepaper. They had also been shopping with their Aunt, Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana ...|$|E
500|$|White {{was only}} able to offer his writers one cent per word, which was {{substantially}} lower than the leading magazines in the field—Analog Science Fiction and Fact paid five cents, and Galaxy and Fantasy & Science Fiction paid three. [...] Most stories would only be submitted to White once the higher-paying markets had rejected them, but among the rejects White was sometimes able to find experimental material that he liked. [...] For example, Piers Anthony {{had been unable to}} sell an early fantasy novel, Hasan; White saw a review of the manuscript and promptly acquired it for Fantastic, where it was serialized starting in the December 1969 issue. [...] White also took care to establish relationships with newer writers. [...] White bought Gordon Eklund's first story, [...] "Dear Aunt Annie", it appeared in the April 1970 issue and was nominated for a Nebula award. [...] Eklund was unwilling to become a full-time writer, despite this success, because of the financial risks, so White agreed <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. [...] The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years. [...] In addition to experimental work, White was able to obtain material by some of the leading sf writers of the day, including Brian Aldiss and John Brunner. [...] White also acquired some early work by writers who became better known in other fields: Roger Ebert sold two stories in the early 1970s to Fantastic; the first, [...] "After the Last Mass", appeared in the February 1972 issue; and in 1975 White bought Ian McEwan's second story, [...] "Solid Geometry". [...] It was included in First Love, Last Rites, McEwan's first short story collection, which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976.|$|E

Mrs. Westangle knew how to write in a formless hand, but she {{did not know how to}} spell, and she had thought it best to have a secretary who could write well and spell correctly.

Existing researches have been trying to find explanations to consumer behaviour online, even though it is complicated to analyse. This thesis is focused exclusively on shopping online for clothes and fashion accessories, investigating on a population between 18 and 25 years old. The hypotheses are based on four main aspects of buying: product, price, enjoyment and convenience. The research will provide elements and key factors on their consumer behaviour towards online shopping of fashion and how online companies could make them becoming more loyal to online shopping and become more prosperous...|$|R

The intention was to show the American public that their economy is helped by illegal immigrants. It resulted {{in at least one}} million marchers nationwide. Major marches were held in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, while smaller events occurred in most states, most prominently in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. Crowds in Los Angeles were estimated at 600,000 for the two boycott marches. At the second largest protest, in Chicago, an estimated 400,000 attended. Not all the organizations in the immigration rights movement supported the boycott and resulted in varied participation rates. The effect the day had on the economy remains largely unknown.|$|R

With the rising generations the Bolsheviki hoped for better results, and that “the total disappearance of religion from Russia {{is only a matter of}} time.” ...|$|R

They drew up a written contract to that effect and solemnly pledged themselves to observe it. They then hung up the document in the interior of the Kaaba to make it even more binding upon themselves. When Quraysh did this, the Banu Hashim and the Banu al-Muttalib joined with 'Abu Talib, went with him to his valley and gathered round him there; but 'Abu Lahab 'Abd al Uzza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib left the Banu Hashim and went with the Quraysh supporting them against 'Abu Talib. This state of affairs continued for two or three years, until the two clans were exhausted, since nothing reached any of them except what was sent secretly by those of the Quraysh who wished to maintain relations with them".|$|R
