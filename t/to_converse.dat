5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> {{with her and}} {{encourages}} her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E
5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E
5|$|In 1526, Portuguese ships {{arrived in}} Mangalore, {{and the number}} of local {{converts}} to Christianity slowly increased. However, a sizeable Christian population did not exist there until {{the second half of the}} 16th century, when there was a large-scale immigration of Christians from Goa to South Canara. They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians had to learn Konkani <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with them. After this migration, the skilled Goan Catholic agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native Bednore rulers of South Canara. They observed their traditional Hindu customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved their lifestyle.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] she said, {{with a sort}} of half laugh, [...] "it is stuffy and horrid. I greatly {{prefer the}} fresh air. I have reason to suppose you do not object <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> under a tree. I see a {{promising}} bit of shade a little farther on." ...|$|R
5|$|In February 1944, Rotblat {{joined the}} Los Alamos Laboratory {{as part of}} Chadwick's British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The usual {{condition}} for people {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project was that they had to become U.S. citizens or British subjects. Rotblat declined, and the condition was waived. At Los Alamos, he was befriended by Stan Ulam, a fellow Polish-Jewish scientist, with whom he was able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> in Polish. Rotblat worked in Egon Bretscher's group, investigating whether high-energy gamma rays produced by nuclear fission would interfere with the nuclear chain reaction process, and then with Robert R. Wilson's cyclotron group.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{also had}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with spectators using a letter board. The director, whose {{identity}} during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, {{was able to do}} this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung (or On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> only among themselves.|$|E
50|$|Vallandigham {{refused to}} join the Knights of the Golden Circle (later renamed the Order of American Knights). Sometime around March 1864, he became {{the leader of the}} Sons of Liberty. In April 1865, Vallandigham testified at the {{conspiracy}} trial of the American Knights in Cincinnati, Ohio. He admitted <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> with Jacob Thompson, the Confederate agent in Canada.|$|R

During {{his time in}} Knoxville, Bumper became a 3-year starter, set the Tennessee career rebounding record (1,113 rebounds), a 16.9 rpg rate; was twice named All-SEC and was named <b>to</b> <b>Converse's</b> All-American team and become known to scores of Vols fans as the [...] "Chairman of the Boards." ...|$|R

The location of loops and digons are determined, and save for a few exceptions, the solution is unique up <b>to</b> <b>converses.</b> The relation between the automorphism groups of a line digraph and its underlying graph follows as a corollary.

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|The next day, August 16, {{the prisoners}} were moved with their guards. One of the mortarmen, Cpl. Roy L. Day Jr., spoke Japanese and was able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> {{with some of the}} North Koreans. That {{afternoon}} he overheard a North Korean lieutenant say that they would kill the prisoners if other American forces advanced too close. Later that day other American forces began to assault Hill 303 to retake the position. B Company and several American tanks tried a second time to retake the hill, now estimated to contain a 700-man battalion. The 61st Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion fired on the hill during the day. That night, G Company succeeded in escaping from Hill 303. Guards took away five of the American prisoners; the others did not know what became of them.|$|E

60|$|To this {{proposition}} I agreed cordially, since, {{to tell the}} truth, if I could have managed to do so with any decent grace, I should {{have been out of}} that hut long before Mameena. So we fell <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> on the condition of Zululand and the dangers that lay ahead for all who were connected with the royal House--a state of affairs which troubled Nandie much, for she was a clear-headed woman, and one who feared the future.|$|R

5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
25|$|During the 2009 competition, held in Brighton, UK, the {{communication}} program restricted judges to 10 minutes for each round, 5 minutes <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with the human, 5 minutes <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with the program. This was {{to test the}} alternative reading of Turing's prediction that the 5-minute interaction was {{to be with the}} computer. For the 2010 competition, the Sponsor again increased the interaction time, between interrogator and system, to 25 minutes, well above the figure given by Turing.|$|E

25|$|Lack {{of money}} {{prevented}} Kittredge from immediately pursuing graduate studies. From 1883 to 1887 he taught Latin at Phillips Exeter Academy. About {{six feet tall}} and, at 140 pounds, slightly built, Kittredge impressed his prep-school students with his exacting standards, sense of humor, and apparent ability <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> fluently in Latin.|$|E
25|$|One {{side effect}} of the {{occupation}} and local resistance {{was an increase in}} the speaking of local languages (Guernésiais in Guernsey and Jèrriais in Jersey). As many of the German soldiers were familiar with both English and French, the indigenous languages enjoyed a brief revival as islanders sought <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> without the Germans understanding.|$|E

30|$|Think-Pair-Share: Students {{are asked}} {{to think about a}} {{question}} posed by the instructor and then discuss it with one or two partners. Students could also be asked to write down their thoughts prior <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> with a partner. After some time (five or so minutes), students are encouraged to share their thoughts {{with the rest of the}} class. This activity may also be helpful during lectures; the lecturer may ask questions and put students in pairs to become more actively involved in the material.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a game of dice that {{combines}} multi-party communication with a tangible interface. The game {{has been used as}} a testbed to study typical conversational behavior patterns in interactions between human users and synthetic agents. In particular, we were interested in the question to what extent the interaction with the agent can be considered as natural. As an evaluation criterion, we propose to investigate whether the communicative behaviors of humans differ when conversing with an agent as opposed <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> with other humans...|$|R
25|$|Older Hohhot {{residents}} mostly tend <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> in raw Hohhot dialect, {{a branch}} of the Jin language from neighbouring Shanxi province. This spoken form can be difficult to understand for speakers of other Mandarin Chinese dialects. The newer residents, mostly concentrated in Xincheng and Saihan Districts, speak Hohhot-based Mandarin, the majority also with a noticeable accent and some unique vocabulary.|$|E

Although Eden was fluent in French and German and able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> with the Chinese premier Chou En-lai in French at Geneva in 1954, he preferred to have diplomats present to translate at meetings {{out of a sense}} of professionalism, as when he met Hitler in February 1934.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands has a {{tradition}} of learning foreign languages, formalised in Dutch education laws. Some 90% of the total population indicate they are able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> in English, 70% in German, and 29% in French. English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools. In most lower level secondary school educations (vmbo), one additional modern foreign language is mandatory during the first two years.|$|E
