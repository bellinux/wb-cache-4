The focus of the research activities {{is the development of}} suitable human-robot interaction methodology. This methodology is being developed to construct control stations suitable for guiding one or more robots in the test facility. The vehicle is to move automatically in an area with numerous obstacles. At the same time the vehicle acquires a topographic map containing <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>situation</b> for later use by its operating crew. The experimental program involves acquisition of a world model using the ROSE (Reconnaissance and Obstacle Surveillance System for unknown Environments) system and the SERO (Synthetic Environment display for real time Robot Operation) situation display using simulation and real components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} act {{socially}} compliant with humans, mobile robots {{need to show}} several behaviors that require the prediction of people’s motion. For example, when a robot avoids a person, it needs to respect the human’s personal space [1] and the avoidance behavior needs to be smooth, {{so that it is}} understandable to the interaction partner. To achieve this, the robot needs to reason about future paths a person is likely to follow. Because humans adapt their avoidance behavior to the robot’s motion, the proposed method performs lifelong learning of the people’s behavior while it adapts its own behavior to their motion. The human avoidance behavior is modeled by a discrete, multi-modal, spatio-temporal distribution over the people’s future occurrences. This prediction is based on the people’s positions and their velocities relatively to the robot and <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>situation</b> of the robot’s environment. The proposed prediction method is significantly better than a simple linear prediction. Particularly, for tactical decisions, like whether to avoid a moving person on the left or on the right side, this approach is well suited. Furthermore, when the humans get used to a robot, also a long-term change of the human behavior towards the robot can be learned by our approach. I...|$|E

The APF theory is a traditional method to plan path for a robot. The Evolutionary APF aims at helping a robot jump out of the local minimum point.

30|$|To sum up, this {{disparity}} between <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> avoidance <b>situation</b> that {{is taught in}} training and that which is really required in traffic conditions may be detrimental to novice riders if they believe that when they have mastered the avoidance manoeuvre in track training they {{have been trained to}} perform it in traffic. We can make the hypothesis that (1) the gap between training and real riding situations, (2) the focus of training systems on the repetition of these decontextualized situations and (3) the fact that motorcycle test checks and promotes the success of the rider in these settings, can participate in the emergence of a phenomenon called “over-confidence”, which represents a potential danger for novices [18, 52]. In-depth study of this phenomenon after licensing must be carried out to confirm the results of Rowden and Watson [53] which show how novice riders tend to engage in risky situations, believing wrongly that they have acquired the skills to master such situations. As Haworth and Mulvihill [8], and if “over-confidence” is recognised as significant, we suggest to take into account this phenomenon in designing new motorcycle training systems in order to make novice riders safer.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} people’s experiences of being dependent on others for care in their final stage of life, as well as what they felt made their experience of being dependent easier or more difficult. The phenomenological-hermeneutical method was chosen, where data collection consisted of open-ended interviews with nine people undergoing palliative care at a hospice unit or at home. The meaning of being care dependent is described via the following themes: changed relationship with oneself and with others, striving to adapt oneself to <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> <b>obstacles,</b> and opportu-nities along the way while dependent. The result is described as an effort, a journey from independence to moments where it was possible to rest and recuperate while struggling with care dependency.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the problem of optimal motion planning with uncertain dynamics. This problem can occur whenever a vehicle suffers damage or when the environment makes the effect of motion actions unpredictable and potentially risky. We address in particular the case of aircraft with structural and/or control surface damage. The goal in this problem is to find an optimal plan for emergency landing, which might entail additional exploration of the aircraft flight envelope. However, this exploration is risky, and must be balanced by possible improvements in the resulting emergency landing plan. Evaluating the risk and potential benefit of exploration allows focusing on the fraction of the envelope that is beneficial, given <b>the</b> current <b>situation</b> (<b>obstacles</b> and possible landing sites). This reduces both the risk and the cost of exploration. The paper surveys previous work on optimal motion planning and flight envelope exploration. It shows how the problem of interleaving both tasks can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process where local dependencies between control states are modele...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the intelligent {{automated guided vehicle}} (AGV) control system. The AGV used in this paper is a virtual vehicle simulated using computer. The purpose of the control system is to control the simulated AGV for moving along the given path towards <b>the</b> goal. Some <b>obstacles</b> can be placed {{on or near the}} path to increase the difficulties of the control system. The intelligent AGV should trace the path by avoiding these <b>obstacles.</b> In some <b>situations,</b> it is inevitable to avoid <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> without reversing. In this paper, we look into the use of fuzzy automaton for controlling the AGV. In order to better avoid <b>the</b> <b>obstacles,</b> reverse strategy has been implemented to the fuzzy automaton controller. Another alternative to incorporate the human expertise and observations is to use a hybrid intelligent controller using fuzzy and case base reasoning to implement the reverse strategy.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} made to study <b>the</b> effect of <b>obstacle</b> on <b>the</b> flow structure of air-water two-phase flow through a rectangular enlarging channel. The cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is considered as circular in shape. Effect of the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> on <b>the</b> flow structure, pressure fluctuation and pressure distribution is made. Finite volume method (FVM) with mixture model and Eulerian model have been adopted for the present numerical simulation. Simulation results are obtained for both steady and unsteady cases. Due to change in both magnitude and direction of local velocities of fluid as the mixture approaches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> there is a marked difference in phase distribution around <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> As <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> increases, this becomes more remarkable. It can also be noticed that vortices before and after <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> becomes stronger with increase in size of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> <b>The</b> pressure difference is also monitored. It is found that as <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> size increases, <b>the</b> pressure drop increases and pressure distribution changes drastically...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} go over a {{vertical}} <b>obstacle</b> face, <b>the</b> front wheels are forced against <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> center and rear wheels. The rotation of the front wheel then lifts {{the front of the}} vehicle up and over <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> <b>The</b> middle wheel is then pressed against <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> rear wheels and pulled against <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> front until it is lifted up and over. Finally, the rear wheel is pulled over <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> front two wheels. During each wheel's traversal of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> forward progress of the vehicle is slowed or completely halted.

30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to mention that, despite the fact that in real applications <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> usually have a non-constant velocity, our algorithm was optimized to be executed in a fast fashion. In each control loop the algorithm is recalculated and the unpredictability of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> detection is smoothened. Usually, the errors in <b>the</b> <b>obstacle’s</b> position and velocity estimations decrease abruptly when <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> approaches <b>the</b> robot, and therefore for <b>the</b> important <b>obstacles</b> (<b>the</b> ones near the robot) the uncertainty is not high.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that if <b>the</b> <b>obstacle’s</b> height is {{approximately}} equal to or greater than the walker’s lower leg length, he cannot pass over <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> easily.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} numerical {{study of}} Taylor bubble flow in a microchannel (diameter 0. 2 mm) having an obstacle is carried out. A square shaped obstacle, of side 0. 02 mm is placed inside the microchannel. Taylor bubble flow is created using T-junction. Water and air enters through two inlets and form Taylor bubble at <b>the</b> T-junction. <b>The</b> <b>obstacle</b> is placed at an appropriate {{distance from the}} T-junction, where the water and gas fluids are getting mixed, along the downstream such that the stabilized Taylor bubble will touch <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> This shows that <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> will be touched by the Taylor bubble which is already in steady motion. <b>The</b> <b>obstacle</b> position is varied along the perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow. Initially <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is kept {{at the center of}} the microchannel i. e., it provides an equal space of 0. 9 mm on either of its sides inside the microchannel. As the Taylor bubble touches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> it splits into two parts and moves through both sides of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> with a perfect symmetric flow. The bubble joins again and gets to its original form as it passes through <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is moved 0. 02 mm away from the center towards one side, i. e., it provides a gap of 0. 11 mm and 0. 07 mm on either side of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> respectively. In this case as the Taylor bubble touches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> it doesn’t split into two parts rather the whole bubble tries to move to the upper side of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> i. e. maximum area side. Similar phenomenon is observed as <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> moves further away from the center line towards one side. The liquid-gas interface is continuously changing its shape due to the disturbance caused by the presence of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> This creates turbulence inside the liquid plugs present in between the two consecutive bubbles, which is shown by using the velocity vector fields. This may raise hope to enhance more heat and mass transfer in the microchannels by placing multiple <b>obstacles</b> inside <b>the</b> microchannel...|$|R
