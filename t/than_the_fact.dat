5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E

Nilsen recalled little about this victim, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he was originally from Belfast, was slim, approximately 5ft.9in. tall, and was aged {{in his early}} 20s. He had encountered this victim somewhere in the West End after the pubs had closed. He was strangled with a tie and his body subsequently placed beneath the floorboards.|$|E

He is implied to be of French descent, and to have fought in a war as a youth. From time to time, Philippe's mother sends him unusual presents.|$|E
25|$|Many of London's pubs {{are known}} to have been used by famous people, but in some cases, such as the {{association}} between Samuel Johnson and Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, this is speculative, based on little more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the person is known to have lived nearby. However, Charles Dickens is known to have visited the Cheshire Cheese, the Prospect of Whitby, Ye Olde Cock Tavern and many others. Samuel Pepys is also associated with the Prospect of Whitby and the Cock Tavern.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of baking Easter breads, {{also known as}} hot cross buns, have been documented to exist {{at least since the}} 1500s.

The Irish in particular have been known to bake a key {{in the shape of a}} cross inside the bread during the Easter period. It is uncertain, however, how cross buns are similar to shlissel challah, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that people have always made signs or symbols on their bread.|$|E

During the Civil War Partridge was a breveted Brigadier General. Toward {{the end of the war}} he served as DeKalb County Clerk and Recorder; from 1864-1867. President Ulysses S.

25|$|In 1888 Roberts {{moved to}} Chicago {{where he worked}} as a site {{superintendent}} for S.S. Beman at Pullman, {{on the south side of}} the city. Roberts remained at that job until 1893. Roberts moved to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park in 1893 and established his own practice which eventually grew to become the largest architecture firm in the village of Oak Park, rivaling even architecture giant Frank Lloyd Wright's practice. In Oak Park he designed over 200 homes which span a multitude of architectural styles. Wright and Roberts were not, themselves, professionally associated, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they were competing architects.|$|E

In her hand she wielded a wand, the symbolic distaff (seiðstafr), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of Örvar-Oddr, the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that {{it was intended to}} signify the otherness of the seiðkona.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, Vivendi {{announced}} a Game Boy Advance version of The Fellowship {{would also be}} released. Developed by Pocket Studios, the game was to be called Lord of the Rings, Part I, and was to feature the full plot of The Fellowship and roughly half of The Two Towers. This would be followed soon after by Lord of the Rings, Part II, featuring {{the second half of}} Two Towers and all of Return of the King. Vivendi revealed little about the games other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they were to be more RPG based than the Xbox Fellowship game, and would be played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view.|$|E

His code of honor also means {{that he will not}} attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, for no other reason <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone’s hands but his own.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the importance of Cerball in Icelandic writings stems from the popularity of the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland among the Norse-Gaels of eleventh century Ireland, who passed these accounts on to the Icelanders, who then attached this famous and warlike king to their ancestry. Whether Cerball was in fact an ancestor of many prominent settler families is, however, of rather less importance <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Icelanders considered it worth reporting their descent from Cerball mac Dúnlainge, whether real or contrived. As with the adoption of Norse names, sagas and other features, and the creation of the Norse-Gael culture, Cerball's adoption in Iceland {{is an example of the}} contacts between Norse and Gaelic society in the Viking Age.|$|E
25|$|In late 1929 Grierson and his cameraman, Basil Emmott, {{completed}} his first film, Drifters, which he wrote, produced and directed. The film, which follows the heroic work of North Sea herring fishermen, was {{a radical departure}} from anything being made by the British film industry or Hollywood. A large part of its innovation lie in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat {{in the middle of a}} gale, while leaving relatively less of the action staged. The choice of topic was chosen less from Grierson's curiosity <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he discovered that the Financial Secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse. It premiered in a private film club in London in November 1929 on a double-bill with Eisenstein's then controversial film The Battleship Potemkin (which was banned from general release in Britain until 1954), and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press.|$|E

According to him, the common denominator among organizational sensory functions (whether they are called market research, business intelligence or market intelligence) is that they deliver information rather than intelligence. Intelligence, says Gilad, is a perspective on <b>facts</b> rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> themselves. Unique among corporate functions, competitive intelligence has a perspective of risks and opportunities for a firm's performance; as such, it (not information activities) {{is part of an}} organization's risk-management activity.|$|R
