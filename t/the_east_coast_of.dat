5|$|Following Greg's formation, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the coast of Mexico from Manzanillo, Colima to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, including Islas Marías.

5|$|Gabrielle {{eventually}} decelerated, and {{by early}} on September10, it curved westward and weakened to a tropical storm.
