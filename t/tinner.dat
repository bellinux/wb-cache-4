25|$|According to René <b>Tinner</b> and Stephan Plank {{in a radio}} {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Conny Plank, it was Brian Eno's idea that Plank should produce the U2-album The Joshua Tree instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, Plank turned down the job ("I cannot work with this singer"). According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny Plank – The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, Plank firstly asked for time for a second thought. In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtbühne Loreley, where U2's Bono introduced Plank to the audience as their new producer. Thereupon Plank has left the concert and never again talked to any member of U2.|$|E

The album reached the top100 in Australia and top40 in New Zealand.

2500|$|Tinner's snips, {{also known}} as <b>tinner</b> snips or tin snips, {{are one of the}} most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades. They usually have extra wide jaws and are made of drop forged carbon steel. Depending on the size of the blade, tin snips can cut between 24 and 16 gauge cold rolled {{low-carbon}} tin. They can be ranged in length from [...] long. There are two main types: straight-pattern and duckbill-pattern. Straight-pattern are best for straight cuts, but can handle gentle curves. Duckbill-pattern snips, {{also known as}} trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also bevelled to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{companion}} Dorothy meets on {{the yellow}} brick road is the Tin Woodman {{who has been}} cursed by the now deceased Wicked Witch of the East. He was once a hard worker yearning to earn money {{to start a family}} with a Munchkin girl. The witch enchanted his axe so that the Woodman chopped off each of his limbs and eventually his body. Each time a <b>tinner</b> healed the Woodman by replacing his body with tin, however once the Tin Woodman's heart was removed he could no longer love. The Tin Woodman symbolizes the Eastern working man competing in an industrialized society. The 19th-century man had {{to keep up with the}} machine in order to be useful and relevant. In this way the Witch of the East's curse [...] "dehumanized a simple laborer so that the faster and better he worked the more quickly he became a kind of machine." [...] The Tin Woodman was caught in the rain and rusted in the same position for one year before Dorothy oils his joints to set him free. The Tin Woodman's year of waiting is parallel to the unemployment of Eastern workers during the severe depression of 1893-1897. His calls of help that were never heard relate to President Grover Cleveland's [...] "hard-hearted refusal" [...] to take action during this time to reinstate the economy. While the Tin Woodman stood still for a year, he finally slowed down enough to ponder life. During this time, he discovers that [...] "the greatest loss [...] had known was the loss of [...] heart" [...] for without it he cannot love. Baum portrays the Tin Woodman as an Eastern worker who lost sight of family values for a moment. [...] Part of the Progressive movement in the 19th century was to reestablish the family as the center of American life. The curse of the Tin Woodman by the Wicked Witch of the East is consistent with the depiction of the witch representing Wall Street and other Eastern big businesses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
