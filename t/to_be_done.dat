Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount of work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in parallel is also independent of the number of processors, whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in parallel varies linearly with the number of processors.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern what ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> {{insisting that the}} scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of what ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented {{as a solution to}} the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E

However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning.

5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Done?</b> (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained {{a source of inspiration}} throughout her life.|$|E

She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on the armament, {{but it had to}} wait until she arrived in Russia.

5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly.

Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E
