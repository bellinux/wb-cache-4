50|$|There is recoil {{associated}} with the discharge of a nail from a nail gun. Contact triggers allow the gun to fire unintended nails if the nose hits the wood surface or a previously placed nail following recoil. Nailers with <b>touch</b> <b>tip</b> (contact) triggers are susceptible to this double firing.
