5|$|On May 25, 2001, {{the print}} edition {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Washington Blade to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after {{the sale of the}} paper, staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize {{with the help of the}} Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.|$|E

The London Evening Standard, the largest paper in London by circulation, endorsed Goldsmith, while <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> the largest circulation to endorse Khan was The Daily Mirror. Of other papers with leading circulation, The Daily Telegraph endorsed Goldsmith, but The Daily Mail only did so indirectly, though its sister paper the Mail on Sunday. Khan received endorsements from The Guardian and the New Statesman, {{as well as}} a lukewarm endorsement from The Financial Times which was critical of both leading candidates.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without her to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined her family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. While her parents approved of her college choice, Ono said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor John Cage advised her to treat <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> flame retardant.|$|E

5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E

25|$|If {{this image}} were {{transferred}} directly to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|E
25|$|Paper {{chromatography}} is {{a technique}} that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.|$|E

25|$|Several anecdotes {{are known}} about Ansuini. He liked to mock the gendarmes, leaving signed fliers {{in the same}} {{restaurants}} {{where he used to}} eat. Once he went elegantly dressed to Bassano in Teverina and entered the barracks of carabinieri {{in the name of a}} trade man on travel from Milan. On his request, he had an escort of two gendarmes, for personal protection during his journey. At the end he asked the two men to deliver a flyer to their commander. It came about that the commander expressed all his anger when he read <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> the signature of Ansuini. The phenomenon of brigandage was close to being extinguished. Ansuini disappeared after a fight with carabinieri. Menichetti was captured after killing the brigadier Sebastiano Preta, and died in prison.|$|E

Driven to the brink of madness, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing that the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through the pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who {{turns out to be a}} hallucination.

A year later, clearly influenced by Priestley, Lavoisier was also discussing respiration at the Académie des sciences. Lavoisier's work began the long train of discovery that produced papers on oxygen respiration and culminated in the overthrow of phlogiston theory and the establishment of modern chemistry.|$|E

500|$|In 1853, Charles Frédéric Gerhardt had {{published}} the first methods to prepare acetylsalicylic acid. [...] In {{the course of}} his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, he mixed acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified. Since no structural theory existed at that time Gerhardt called the compound he obtained [...] "salicylic-acetic anhydride" [...] (wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure). When Gerhardt tried to dissolve the solid in a diluted solution of sodium carbonate it immediately decomposed to sodium salts of salicylic and acetic acids. In 1859 an Austrian chemist, Hugo von Gilm, obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called acetylierte Salicylsäure, acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride. In 1869 Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. (Prinzhorn is credited in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> conducting the experiments.) They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.|$|E
500|$|In 1897 White {{became the}} editor of Ke Ahailono oHawaii (translated as The Hawaiian Herald), a Hawaiian-language {{newspaper}} founded by Hui Kālaiʻāina. After the overthrow, this Hawaiian political group switched its political agenda toward opposing annexation to the United States and restoring Liliʻuokalani. White co-owned <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> David Keku and John Kahahawai. The assistant editor was Samuel K. Pua, a colleague of White's in the 1892–93 legislature from Oahu, although Pua would resign in October of the same year. At the conception of Ke Ahailono oHawaii, the English newspaper The Independent noted that [...] "The New venture {{under the control of}} Messrs. White and Pua, should indeed be a White Flower of journalism, although the genial 'Sam' could change the euphony by adding another terminal vowel to his name." [...] The paper was published at Honolulu's Makaainana Printing House, owned by F.J. Testa. Weekly issues were published from June4 to October29, 1897. In May 1899 Testa sued White and the four other proprietors of the newspaper including David Kalauokalani (president of Hui Kālaiʻāina) for unpaid printing costs of the short-lived paper. The court ruled in favor of Testa awarding him the amount of $743,40, although White was only required to pay one-fifth of $447.50 because he left the venture when the [...] "troubles" [...] started.
