5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12.

5|$|The {{identification}} of stolen diamonds presents {{a set of}} difficult problems.

The 2010 census put 5,021,810 of the state's 6,392,017 residents within these cities and towns, accounting for 78.56% of the population. Most of the population is concentrated within the Phoenix metropolitan area, with an 2010 census population of 4,192,887 (65.60% of the state population).|$|E

5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the primary}} sources, i.e., those {{composed}} by the Jesuits themselves {{during the years}} 1691 through 1767, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> extensively researched (many as yet have not been thoroughly examined) are few. The most useful is the monumental Historia general de la Compañía de Jesús en la Provincia del Perú: Crónica anómina de 1600 que trata del establecimiento y misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los países de habla española en la América meridional, vol. II, edited by Francisco Mateos (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1944). Also of importance is the unedited archive of correspondence from the Jesuits of Paraguay from the years 1690-1718. Collectively known as “Cartas a los Provinciales de la Provincia del Paraguay 1690-1718,” these manuscripts are housed in the Jesuit Archives of Argentina in Buenos Aires, which also contain the invaluable annals of the Paraguay Province of the Company of Jesus, covering the years 1689-1762. The German edition of Fr. Julián Knogler’s Inhalt einer Beschreibung der Missionen deren Chiquiten, Archivum Historicum Societatis Jesu, 39/78 (Rome: Company of Jesus, 1970) is indispensable, as is his account Relato sobre el país y la nación de los Chiquitos en las Indias Occidentales o América del Sud y en la misiones en su territorio, for a condensed version of which, see Werner Hoffman, Las misiones jesuíticas entre los chiquitanos (Buenos Aires: Fundación para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, 1979). Fr. Juan de Montenegro’s Breve noticia de las missiones, peregrinaciones apostólicas, trabajos, sudor, y sangre vertida, en obsequio de la fe, de el venerable padre Augustín Castañares, de la Compañía de Jesús, insigne missionero de la provincia del Paraguay, en las missiones de Chiquitos, Zamucos, y ultimamente en la missión de los infieles Mataguayos, (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor del Supremo Consejo de la Inquisición, de la Reverenda Cámara Apostólica, y del Convento de las Señoras de la Encarnación, en la Caba Baxa, 1746) and Fr. Juan Patricio Fernández’s Relación historial de las misiones de los indios, que llaman chiquitos, que están a cargo de los padres de la Compañía de Jesús de la provincia del Paraguay (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor de Libros, 1726) are also valuable. There are other primary sources as yet unexamined, the majority of which are archived in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija (in Bolivia); Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Tucumán (in Argentina); Asunción (Paraguay); Madrid; and Rome.|$|E

40|$|Background: Traditional {{recommendations}} {{hold that}} open fractures in {{both children and}} adults require urgent surgi-cal débridement {{for a number of}} reasons, including the preservation of soft-tissue viability and vascular status as well as the prevention of infection. Following the widespread use of early administration of antibiotics, a number of single-institution studies challenged the belief that urgent surgical débridement decreases the risk of acute infection. Methods: We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of open fractures <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> treated at six tertiary pe-diatric medical centers between 1989 and 2000. The standard protocol at each medical center was for all children to be given intravenous antibiotics upon arrival in the emergency department. The medical records of all children with open fractures were reviewed to identify the location of the fracture, the interval between the injury and the time of surgery, the Gustilo and Anderson classification, and the occurrence of acute infection. Results: The analysis included 554 open fractures in 536 consecutive patients who were eighteen years of age or younger. The overall infection rate was 3 % (sixteen of 554). The infection rate was 3 % (twelve of 344) for fractures <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> treated within six hours after the injury, compared with 2 % (four of 210) for <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> treated at least seven hours after the injury; this difference was not significant (p = 0. 43). When the fractures were separated according to the Gustilo and Anderson classification system, {{there were no significant differences}} in the in-fection rate between <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> treated within six hours after the injury and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> treated a...|$|R
