5|$|The police arrest {{a second}} suspect named Tweety (Vincent Miller), who {{was found in}} {{possession}} of the murdered woman's locket. The detectives question Marvin and Tweety separately until Tweety identifies the shooter as 19-year-old Vaughn Perkins (Lloyd Goodman). Howard is surprised to learn Vaughn has a mostly clean criminal record, and his family insists Vaughn would never kill anybody. Vaughn is arrested without incident, but Ellison is unable to identify the three suspects {{because he does not}} remember their faces. Meanwhile, Ellison sees his wife's body in the morgue, and gets upset that her clothes and wedding ring have been removed. Bayliss later returns the ring to Ellison, who admits he feels guilty for not protecting his wife or stopping the shooter. Ellison asks to hold Bayliss' gun just <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> feels, and Bayliss reluctantly agrees.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> feels to be an ornament. I had nothing to do in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E

2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quite a few critics {{cited the}} long and {{fragmented}} development time as {{a major factor in}} the finished product. In a positive review PC Gamer noted that [...] "years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some", adding, [...] "There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times." [...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to never talk about it again. Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on." [...] Jake Denton of Computer and Video Games wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the [...] "5 most underrated games of 2011", while admitting the game's overall faulty structure. Also Joseph Milne of FPSguru.com featured the game on his list of [...] "Top 5 underrated games" [...] at number 4 on the list.|$|E
