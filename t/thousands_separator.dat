2500|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{confusion}} {{between the use of}} commas and full stops, the <b>thousands</b> <b>separators</b> should be thin spaces - for example π= [...]|$|R
5000|$|Any line-break {{inside a}} number, inside a {{compound}} unit, or between number and unit should be avoided. Where {{this is not}} possible, line breaks should coincide with <b>thousands</b> <b>separators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Historically, in Germany and Austria, <b>thousands</b> <b>separators</b> were {{occasionally}} {{denoted by}} alternating uses of comma and point, e.g. 1.234,567.890,12 for [...] "eine Milliarde 234 Millionen ...", {{but this is}} never seen in modern days and requires explanation to a contemporary German reader.|$|R

40|$|This package prints {{numbers with}} a {{separator}} every three digits and convert numbers given as 12345. 6 e 789 to 12 345, 6 · 10 789. Numbers are {{printed in the}} current mode (text or math) {{in order to use}} the correct font. Many things, including the decimal sign, the <b>thousand</b> <b>separator,</b> as well as the product sign can be changed by the user, e. g., to reach 12, 345. 6 e 789. If requested, numprint can round numbers to a given number of digits. If an optional argument is given it is printed upright as unit. Numbers can be rounded to a given number of digits. The package supports an automatic, language-dependent change of the number format. Tabular alignment using the tabular(*), array, tabularx, and longtable environments (similar to the dcolumn and rccol packages) is supported using all features of numprint. Additional text can be added before and after the formatted number...|$|R

50|$|Different {{countries}} officially designate different symbols for the decimal mark. The {{choice of}} {{symbol for the}} decimal mark also affects the choice of symbol for the <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> used in digit grouping, so the latter is also treated in this article.|$|E
5000|$|In the Arab world, where Eastern Arabic numerals {{are used}} for writing numbers, a {{different}} character is used to separate the integer and fractional parts of numbers. It {{is referred to as}} an Arabic decimal separator (...) (in hex U+066B) in Unicode. An Arabic <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> (...) also exists.|$|E
50|$|In December 1986, {{after the}} ship's company of Francis Hammond raised over $11,000 for Navy Relief (beating their goal of {{ten times the}} ship's hull number), {{permission}} was granted to temporarily add a dollar sign, a <b>thousands</b> <b>separator,</b> and an extra zero to the hull number painted {{on the side of}} the ship.|$|E
5000|$|The symbols [...] "٫", [...] "٬", [...] "٪", [...] "؉" [...] and [...] "؊" [...] {{may be used}} as the decimal mark, <b>{{thousand}}s</b> <b>separator,</b> percent sign, {{per mille}} sign and per ten thousand sign respectively when writing with Eastern Arabic numerals, e.g. 3.14159265358 [...] "٣٫١٤١٥٩٢٦٥٣٥٨", 1,000,000,000 [...] "١٬٠٠٠٬٠٠٠٬٠٠٠", 100% [...] "٪١٠٠".

5000|$|Switzerland: There are two cases: 1''''''234''''''567.89 is {{used for}} {{currency}} values. An apostrophe as a <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> along with a dot [...] "." [...] as the decimal mark. For other values, the SI-style [...] is used with a commas [...] "," [...] as the decimal mark. The apostrophe {{is also the most}} common variety for non-currency values: 1''''''234''''''567,89 [...] - [...] though this usage is officially discouraged.|$|E
5000|$|In Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden {{and much}} of Europe: [...] or 1.234.567,89. In handwriting, 1˙234˙567,89 is also seen, but never in Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia or Sweden. In Italy, a {{straight}} apostrophe is also used in handwriting: 1'234'567,89. In the Netherlands, the points <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> is preferred in currency amounts, and the space for other large numbers.|$|E
50|$|In English the {{decimal point}} was {{originally}} {{printed in the}} center of the line (0·002), but with the advent of the typewriter it was placed at the bottom of the line, so that a single key could be used as a full stop/period and as a decimal point. In many non-English languages a full-stop/period at the bottom of the line is used as a <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> with a comma being used as the decimal point.|$|E
5000|$|In Estonia, {{currency}} numbers {{often use}} a dot [...] "." [...] as the decimal mark, and a space as a <b>thousands</b> <b>separator.</b> This is most visible on shopping receipts and in documents that also use other numbers with decimals, such as measurements. This practice {{is used to}} better distinguish between prices and other values with decimals. An older convention uses dots to separate thousands (with commas for decimals) [...] - [...] this older practice {{makes it easier to}} avoid word breaks with larger numbers.|$|E
5000|$|The International Bureau of Weights and Measures {{states that}} [...] "when {{there are only}} four digits {{before or after the}} decimal marker, it is {{customary}} not to use a space to isolate a single digit". Likewise, some manuals of style state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1000 to 9999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, APA style stipulates a <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> for [...] "most figures of 1,000 or more" [...] except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Written numerals are {{arranged}} with their lowest-value digit to the right, with higher value positions {{added to the}} left. That {{is identical to the}} arrangement used by Western texts using Hindu-Arabic numerals even though Arabic script is read from right to left. The symbols [...] "٫" [...] and [...] "٬", [...] " [...] may be used as the decimal mark and the <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> respectively when writing with Eastern Arabic numerals, e.g. [...] 3.14159265358, [...] 1,000,000,000. Negative signs are written to the left of magnitudes, e.g. [...] −3. In-line fractions are written with the numerator and denominator on the left and right of the fraction slash respectively, e.g. [...] 2/7.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the design and}} usage began to be {{specific}} within each region. In Western Europe the usage became to use the quotation marks in pairs but [...] "pointing" [...] outside. In Britain those marks were elevated to the same height {{of the top of}} capital letters (“…”). In France, {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century those marks were modified to a more angular shape («…»). Some authors claim that the reason for this was a practical one, in order to get a character that was clearly distinguishable from the apostrophes, the commas and the parenthesis (also, in other scripts, the angular quotation marks are distinguishable from other punctuation characters—the Greek breathing marks, the Armenian emphasis and apostrophe, the Arabic comma, decimal separator, <b>thousands</b> <b>separator,</b> etc.).|$|E
50|$|Special {{numbers were}} used {{occasionally}} to denote {{the type of}} vehicles they were on. For a while in the 1930s, in Bucharest, numbers between 10,000-B and 12,999-B (the comma was used as <b>thousands</b> <b>separator)</b> were taxis; some had Tx as an additional tag, as did buses, which started with 15,000-B. In the 1950s, small commercial vehicles were given numbers over 25,000, large commercial vehicles and buses numbers over 50,000, tractors over 65,000 and motorcycles over 75,000. By 1966, when the system was changed, the number of cars in Bucharest had surpassed over 23,000 and there were over 90,000 motorcycles. Although in the interbellum period 1 was the smallest number possible (0 in Bucharest), under Communism numbers started with 101, possibly influenced by the Soviet system, where they started with 01-01.|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} spoken {{international}} auxiliary languages, Ido, Esperanto, and Interlingua, all use the comma as the decimal mark. Interlingua {{has used the}} comma as its decimal mark {{since the publication of}} the Interlingua Grammar in 1951. Esperanto also uses the comma as its official decimal mark, while thousands are separated by non-breaking spaces: 12 345 678,9. Ido's Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido (Complete Detailed Grammar of the International Language Ido) officially states that commas are used for the decimal mark while full stops are used to separate thousands, millions, etc. So the number 12,345,678.90123 (in American notation) for instance, would be written 12.345.678,90123 in Ido. The 1931 grammar of Volapük by Arie de Jong uses the comma as its decimal mark, and (somewhat unusually) uses the middle dot as the <b>thousands</b> <b>separator</b> (12·345·678,90123).|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the advent}} of printing, most Greek {{punctuation}} was gradually standardized with French: the hypodiastole was fully unified with the comma, the comma serves as the decimal point (and in this use is called the [...] "hypodiastole") and it also functions as a silent letter {{in a handful of}} Greek words, principally distinguishing [...] (ó,ti, [...] "whatever") from [...] (óti, [...] "that"). The full stop serves as the <b>thousands</b> <b>separator,</b> and guillemets (εισαγωγικά) and em-length quotation dashes (παύλα) typically serve to indicate direct speech. The principal difference is the Greek question mark , which developed a shape so similar to the Latinate semicolon [...] that Unicode decomposes its separate code point identically. The ano teleia middot serves as the Greek semicolon but is so uncommon that it has often been left off of Greek keyboards. The Exclamation mark in Modern Greek (Θαυμαστικό) is mostly used like in English. The Hyphen, the Brackets, the Colon (punctuation) the Ellipsis and the Slash (punctuation) are also in use, while the splash has sometimes the function to show common abbreviations like α/φοί for αδελφοί 'brothers'. Instead of the Ampersand the Greek ligature Kai (conjunction) (ϗ) is sometimes in use.|$|E
