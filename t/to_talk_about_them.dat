500|$|In January 2013, The Sunday Mirror {{revealed}} {{that in a}} UKIP members' online forum Gasper had condemned LGBT rights as a [...] "lunatic's charter", while claiming that some homosexuals prefer sex with animals over that with other humans, and reiterating her belief in a link between homosexuality and paedophilia. The newspaper characterised the comments as [...] "extremist and offensive" [...] and noted that the forum contained many homophobic and racist statements from UKIP members. When The Sunday Mirror asked for comment, Gasper stated that [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> It's none of your business." [...] Political commentator Nick Cohen, commenting in The Observer, described Gasper as an advocate of [...] "dumb prejudice".|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} {{consists of}} the repeated {{use of the word}} na. Stefani reaches her highest note of the song, E5, as part of a trichord and her lowest, G3, during this section. After the first chorus, Stefani discusses dreams of wealth and luxury, and she namechecks fashion designers Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano. Stefani commented that the references were not product placement but that she included them [...] "because I think they're rad and want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> [...] I'd give all my money to [...] and buy all her clothes!" [...] A bridge, in which Stefani's voice is overdubbed, precedes the second chorus. During the second verse Stefani discusses her Harajuku Girls, and she then repeats the bridge. Following Eve's rap, Stefani sings the chorus and closes the song with a coda, which, like the introduction, consists of repeating the word na.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, {{a scandal}} broke when she revealed {{in an interview}} that during 1949 she had posed for nude pictures, which were featured in calendars. Fox had learned of the photographs some weeks earlier, and to contain the potentially disastrous effects on her career, the studio and Monroe had decided <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> openly while stressing that she had only posed for the photos while she was in a dire financial situation. The strategy succeeded in getting her public sympathy and increased interest in her films: the following month, she was featured on the cover of Life as [...] "The Talk of Hollywood". Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with other publicity stunts that year, such as wearing a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the Miss America Pageant parade, and by stating to gossip columnist Earl Wilson that she usually wore no underwear.|$|E

500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Getman {{is quite}} clear about his goal: [...] "Some may say that the Gulag is a {{forgotten}} part of history {{and that we do}} not need to be reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma againthis time for good. But the people must be reminded...of one of the harshest acts of political repression in the Soviet Union. My paintings may help achieve this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Ukrainian {{prisoner}} Nikolai Getman {{who spent}} the years 1945–1953 in Kolyma, records his testimony in pictures rather than words. But {{he does have a}} plea: [...] "Some may say that the Gulag is a forgotten part of history and that we {{do not need to be}} reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma again— this time for good. But the people must be reminded... of one of the harshest acts of political repression in the Soviet Union. My paintings may help achieve this." [...] The Jamestown Foundation provides access to all 50 of Getman's paintings together with explanations of their significance.|$|E

2500|$|Watermark {{opens with}} a same-titled {{instrumental}} track with wordless vocals, a tradition that Enya continued on her next three studio albums. Its title derived from a poem Roma was writing {{at the time of}} recording, which inspired her to name the track accordingly. However, the track was kept as an instrumental and the poem was left unused. It was printed {{for the first time in}} the liner notes for Enya's 2002 box set, Only Time – The Collection. During a meeting with Enya, Diana, Princess of Wales revealed that [...] "Watermark" [...] was a favourite of hers. [...] "Cursum Perficio" [...] came about after Enya and the Ryans had seen a documentary on American actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who once wrote the phrase on the tiles on her front doorstep. It means [...] "Your journey ends here" [...] in Latin, and Roma completed a set of Latin lyrics based around the phrase. Enya wanted her vocals to be [...] "bold and up-front" [...] like that of a choral piece, and realised early on that translating its lyrics into English or Gaelic would not complement the music, so Latin was used. [...] "On Your Shore" [...] refers to Magheragallon Beach at Enya's hometown of Gweedore, County Donegal that houses a cemetery where her grandparents are buried. Its emotional and personal connection to her childhood inspired her to write it. She explained, [...] "When the first people lived in Gweedore, there was a sort of shelter for the fishermen ... The sea came in when there was a sermon going on and everybody was wiped out. There are a lot of stories like that, where we would start <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and a song would evolve." [...] It was written as an instrumental at first, but Enya and Nicky found lyrics suited the track better. Numerous [...] "vocal experiments" [...] were tried out for it, but neither suited the music, so it took the more simple form of a single lead vocal with one synthesiser. The clarinet solo was originally sung on its demo, but Nicky suggested a clarinet was the most suitable instrument which suited the vocals she used when singing it.|$|E
