5|$|Nauru {{has used}} its {{position}} {{as a member of}} the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan (ROC) and China (PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with <b>the</b> <b>PRC,</b> accepting $130million from <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> for this action. In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005, and diplomatic ties with <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> were officially severed on 31 May 2005. However, <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> continues to maintain a representative office on Nauru.|$|E

40|$|Forging closer {{economic}} {{relations between the}} People's Republic of China (<b>PRC)</b> and <b>the</b> Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the last 2 decades has contributed to building a stronger ASEAN economy. It is particularly important to know how <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> foreign direct investment responds to ASEAN's economic performance. This study investigates the causal relationship between <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> foreign direct investment and economic growth among the 10 ASEAN member countries from 1995 to 2013. Panel unit root tests, a spatial panel vector autoregressive model, and spatial Granger causality are employed as empirical techniques for spatial panel estimation. The empirical results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> direct investment in ASEAN caused economic growth in ASEAN, and economic growth in ASEAN resulted in <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> direct investment in ASEAN. This finding raises potentially interesting external investment policy implications...|$|R
5|$|Brundage, {{through his}} tenure, slowly {{came around to}} the {{position}} advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that the important thing was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. <b>The</b> <b>PRC</b> again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E

5|$|On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson {{to launch}} a four-week attack on North Vietnam's lines of communications, which would isolate that nation from its {{overland}} sources of supply in <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North's imports came down the northeast railroad from <b>the</b> <b>PRC,</b> while the remaining two-thirds came by sea through Haiphong and other ports.

During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} under <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> State Council {{was announced}} on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E

To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great Wall.|$|E

40|$|We apply {{a direct}} {{approach}} to estimate domestic value added {{embedded in the}} People's Republic of China's (<b>PRC)</b> exports. <b>The</b> estimates suggest that the domestic value added of processing exports and processing high-tech exports gradually increased from 30 % and 25 %, to 44 % and 45 %, respectively, between 1997 and 2012. On the other hand, the domestic content of processing exports with supplied materials fell to 14 % from the peak of 35 %. In 2012, the domestic value added of <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> total exports remained below 77 %. Our estimates {{prove to be the}} upper limits of the corresponding trade in value added. Compared to our estimates, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Trade in Value Added database (TiVA) significantly overestimates the domestic content of <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> exports. TiVA's estimates are also inconsistent {{with the fact that the}} share of processing exports in <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> total exports has decreased steadily. In addition, we show that <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> processing exports demonstrate significant heterogeneity across its trading partners; processing exports account for a large portion of total exports to high income countries but a relatively small portion of exports to low income countries. This heterogeneity implies that the domestic content of <b>the</b> <b>PRC's</b> exports varies significantly by destination...|$|R

China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited {{and she was the}} first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with the British government through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able to reach out to women’s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations {{from other parts of the}} world for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year after he left the FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b>|$|E
