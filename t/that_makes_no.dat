This contrasts to the state highway system <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E

Supposedly, when Plucket's English prisoners from prizes returned to Britain and reported that Jalouse was a 12-gun brig, Wallis was court-martialed and reduced in rank.

Grout, in his History of Western Music, praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: [...] "Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head." [...] Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed to know it by heart; [...] "It is music <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere". By broad consent, Carmen represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of opéra comique.|$|E

Noting conservative Catholics who have dissented from this last teaching, he identifies Mother Teresa as [...] "the most consistently reactionary figure." [...] Hitchens quotes her speech when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979: [...] "Today, abortion is the worst evil, and the greatest enemy of peace." [...] Hitchens goes on to argue that women become empowered when given the right to contraceptives. He writes that giving women control over their fertility and empowering them is the only known cure to poverty.|$|E
2500|$|For each {{transmitted}} message, {{the sending}} operator would follow a standard procedure. From September 1938, {{he would use}} an initial position to encrypt the indicator and send it in clear, followed by the message key that had been enciphered at that setting. If the ground setting (...) was GKX for example, he would then use Enigma with the rotors set to GKX to encrypt the message setting, which he might choose to be RTQ; which might encrypt to LLP. (Before May 1940, the encrypted message setting was repeated, but <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> difference to Herivel's insight.) The operator would then turn his rotors to RTQ and encrypt the actual message. Thus, the preamble to the message would be the unencrypted ground setting (GKX), followed by the encrypted message setting (LLP). A receiving Enigma operator could use the information to recover the message setting and then decrypt the message.|$|E
2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's so much going on that it's starting to feel unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> sense at all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA noted Tezuka's [...] "ability to {{simultaneously}} play with narrative devices and {{the emotions of}} his readers"; the former with how he uses different viewpoints, and the latter with Luster first hating Tomura but later pitying her. Luster concluded that the manga is: [...] "sexy, dark, and ultimately kind of tragic". Carlo Santos of Anime News Network called the story gripping, with Tezuka [...] "creating a massive but memorable network of characters", {{as well as with}} its twists and [...] "twisted psychology". Santos also felt that the manga represented Tezuka at his most serious with the focus on action and the ambitious art, with its [...] "wild metaphors and images jump off the page." [...] However, Santos criticized the exaggerated character designs which clashed with the manga's realistic themes, the misogynistic actions of the male characters, and the pacing at certain points. Katie Skelly complimented the contemporary fashion depicted with the character's clothing. She felt that the manga was Tezuka's response to gekiga, but that the [...] "cartoony" [...] character design diminished some of its seriousness. Skelly could also identify with the [...] start of the manga where Tomura's accomplishments are questioned by the public. Chris Kirby of the Fandom Post found Tomura to be an unsympathetic character, but called her compelling to observe in the manga's [...] "dog-eat-dog world of the 60s and 70s". Kirby also complimented Tezuka's ability to pursue multiple ideas and commentary in the manga without losing focus. Lastly he noted the importance of Tezuka's art style, where he uses [...] "experimentation and expression", and which represents a [...] "personal metamorphosis of Tezuka himself." [...] Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf found herself surprisingly sympathetic towards Tomura, saying that Tezuka [...] "treats her with more respect and even affection" [...] compared to Ayako, and that, while the manga is scathing, an [...] "exuberance to Tezuka's writing [...] keeps it from sinking into real darkness." [...] Tom Spurgeon said that Tomura's [...] "awfulness" [...] was [...] "weirdly enjoyable" [...] because of Tezuka's frank portrayal of her. He also felt that Tezuka's art kept the reader's interest with its variety, saying: [...] "It's another sign of a great artist that they can seemingly do whatever they want and yet what they choose to do remains worthwhile." [...] Steve Bennett of ICv2 described the manga as an [...] "unbelievably bleak, unsentimental indictment of human life <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> attempt to impart anything like a moral", concluding that it is a [...] "compelling work, meant for a genuinely mature audience, skillfully told by [...]" [...] David Brothers of Comics Alliance called Tezuka's art style [...] "eminently readable", with a skillful use of panels and metaphors, and said of Tezuka: [...] "his cartooning is wonderful, his writing relentlessly focused, and his plotting just that right balance of creepy and exciting." [...] Lori Henderson of Manga Village compared Tomura's sociopathic nature to Yuki's from MW, but said that the former is an example of [...] "survival of the fittest", while the latter is a product of his environment. She also calls Tomura inhuman in her ability to evolve and survive, with Mizuno serving as a foil to her and being the only one able to affect her. Henderson concludes that Tomura is a sympathetic character, that the story with Kamaishi was the highlight of the manga, and that the manga is a [...] "great thriller".|$|E
