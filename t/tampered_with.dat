50|$|<b>Tampering</b> <b>with</b> {{evidence}} {{is closely related}} to the legal issue of spoliation of evidence, which is usually the civil law or due process version of the same concept (but may itself be a crime). <b>Tampering</b> <b>with</b> {{evidence is}} also closely related to obstruction of justice and perverting the course of justice, and these two kinds of crimes are often charged together. The goal of <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> evidence is usually to cover up a crime.|$|R

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been <b>tampered</b> <b>with</b> so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2003, Thomas was apprehended by Pakistani {{immigration}} officials {{at an airport}} {{in the city of}} Karachi, and taken into custody. Thomas had with him items including an Australian-issue passport, an airline ticket for travel to Indonesia, and about $ 3,800 in cash. The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been <b>tampered</b> <b>with,</b> for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001. He was blindfolded, and driven to an unknown location, where he was questioned for about two hours by two Pakistani men and two Americans.|$|E

5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was <b>tampered</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{his career}} spanned the {{desegregation}} and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not <b>tampered</b> <b>with</b> by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E

The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. No one {{has been charged with}} Wone's killing. In November 2008, Wone's widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011 for an undisclosed sum and agreement.|$|E

5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are <b>tampered</b> <b>with.</b> If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have drawn}} {{on a range}} of sources on Henry, {{including}} the accounts of chroniclers; other documentary evidence, including early pipe rolls; and surviving buildings and architecture. The three main chroniclers to describe the events of Henry's life were William of Malmesbury, Orderic Vitalis, and Henry of Huntingdon, but each incorporated extensive social and moral commentary into their accounts and borrowed a range of literary devices and stereotypical events from other popular works. Other chroniclers include Eadmer, Hugh the Chanter, Abbot Suger, and the authors of the Welsh Brut. Not all royal documents from the period have survived, but {{there are a number of}} royal acts, charters, writs, and letters, along with some early financial records. Some of these have since been discovered to be forgeries, and others had been subsequently amended or <b>tampered</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E

Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time {{over the next four years}} in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had <b>tampered</b> <b>with</b> her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E

5|$|Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first {{appeared}} in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, André, as {{it was part of}} the Azerbaijan SSR at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the 2009 contest: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument We Are Our Mountains during an introductory video for the Armenian entry. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had <b>tampered</b> <b>with</b> its feed of the broadcast to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security. Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaching the privacy of voters.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, the Autobot penal {{facility}} on Garrus-9 is {{attacked by the}} Combaticons, who escape with the Monstructor component Transformers, forcing a reluctant Fortress Maximus to dispatch Arcee to track them down. Learning of this, Prime pulls Prowl's detachment away from Earth to help contain the problem, though Hot Rod elects to stay to learn Sunstreaker's fate. Nightbeat also suspects someone has <b>tampered</b> <b>with</b> his memory. Elsewhere, Sixshot, having encountered and felt a kinship with the Reapers before, defects to their side, but is taken out by a returned Starscream (revived by the other Decepticons {{to stand up to}} Megatron), leading to a full-scale battle between the Decepticons and Reapers. The Decepticons win, with aid from Galvatron, who escapes with Sixshot's body as the US military locates the Decepticons' base. Scorponok merges with the human Dante into a new body, but is unable to prevent Hunter, now merged with Sunstreaker's mind in a copy of his body, from escaping. In the Dead Universe Nemesis Prime, Jhiaxus, and Galvatron agree the endgame is about to begin.|$|E
5|$|M sends Bond to {{investigate}} Carver after he releases news {{articles about the}} crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it.

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been <b>tampered</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E
