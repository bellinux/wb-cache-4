5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E
25|$|After 1832, when {{registration}} of voters was introduced, a turnout figure is given for contested elections.

To the extent that voters did not use both their votes <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> underestimate of turnout. If the electorate figure is unknown the last known electorate figure is used to provide an estimate of turnout.|$|E

If the matrix entries are real numbers, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> n2-dimensional disconnected manifold. The orthogonal groups, the symmetry groups of the sphere and hyperspheres, are n(n−1)/2 dimensional manifolds, where n−1 is the dimension of the sphere.

On Father’s Day, 2013, Natalie was in Tina Sinatra's Father’s Day Special on Sirius Radio.

25|$|The {{restraint}} koinophilia exerts on {{phenotypic change}} suggests that evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided {{as a result}} of a severe scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in small restricted communities, such as on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, caves, or during periods of glaciation, or following mass extinctions, when sudden bursts of evolution can be expected. Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates severely restricted, but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift and inbreeding cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic composition. Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes. If an isolated population such as this survives its genetic upheavals, and subsequently expands into an unoccupied niche, or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors, a new species, or subspecies, will have come in being. In geological terms <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will, thereafter, result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation.|$|E

Though he initially thinks that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extremely difficult task, he discovers that actual security is appallingly terrible and he easily figures out the password to hack his account after the first try. While trying to transfer all of his excess expenses from his account to Krenshaw, the agent enters the room and holds a gun up to Archer's head. He reveals that he is actually a Russian spy named Kremenski and fears the agency has started {{to realize that he}} is a mole, so he plans on stealing $50,000 from Archer's account and fleeing from the country. Just then, however, Archer's ex-girlfriend—Agent Lana Kane—arrives and pulls a gun on Kremenski. She and Archer begin to argue and the mole is able to escape.|$|E

Expected to be up-and-running by 2010. Other tenants already announced for the park include a corrosion research centre sponsored by General Motors and a diesel engine research lab sponsored by Ford.|$|E
2500|$|While viral vectors are 40% more {{efficient}} in transferring genes, {{they are not}} fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an inflammatory response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild edema or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after intraarticular injection and <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important disadvantage. [...] However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by ex vivo gene delivery method. In Osteoarthritis gene therapy, ex vivo method {{makes it possible to}} transfect not only the cells of the synovial lining of joints but also articular chondrocytes and chondroprogenitor cells in cartilage.|$|E

2500|$|According to the London Sunday Times on March 20, 2005, {{despite their}} {{cultural}} differences:Riza, an Arab feminist who confounds portrayals of Wolfowitz {{as a leader}} of a [...] "Zionist conspiracy" [...] of Jewish neoconservatives in Washington ... works as the bank's senior gender co-ordinator for the Middle East and north Africa ... not only shares Wolfowitz's passion for spreading democracy in the Arab world, but is said to have reinforced his determination to remove Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime.The relationship created further controversy over Wolfowitz's nomination to head the World Bank, because the bank's ethics rules preclude sexual relationships between a manager and a staff member serving under that manager, even if one reports to the other only indirectly through a chain of supervision. Sharon Churcher and Annette Witheridge, in The Daily Mail, quote one World Bank employee's statement that [...] "Unless Riza gives up her job, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> impossible conflict of interest"; the observation of [...] "a Washington insider": [...] "His womanizing has come home to roost ... Paul was a foreign policy hawk long before he met Shaha, but it doesn't look good to be accused of being under the thumb of your mistress"; and Wolfowitz's response: [...] "If a personal relationship presents a potential conflict of interest, I will comply with Bank policies to resolve the issue." ...|$|E
