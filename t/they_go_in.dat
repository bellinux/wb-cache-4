This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where <b>they</b> <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent. Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.|$|E
500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E

2500|$|Hawaiʻi {{is said to}} {{have been}} named after Hawaiʻiloa, the legendary Polynesian {{navigator}} who first discovered it. Other accounts attribute the name to the legendary realm of Hawaiki, a place from which some Polynesian people are said to have originated, the place where <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the afterlife, or the realm of the gods and goddesses. Captain James Cook, the English explorer and navigator who was the captain of the first European expedition that discovered the Hawaiian Islands, called them the [...] "Sandwich Islands" [...] after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich. Cook was killed on the Big Island at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779, in a mêlée which followed the theft of a ship's boat.|$|E

Some, round whose neck big stones are tied, are drowned in deep water. Others again roll about in the Kadambavâlukâ (river) or in burning chaff, and are roasted in it. [...] And {{they come to the}} great impassable hell, full of agony, called Asûrya (i.e. where the sun does not shine), where there is great darkness, where fires, placed above, below, and all around, are blazing. There, as in a cave, being roasted on the fire, he is burned, having lost the reminiscence (of his sins) and {{consciousness}} of everything else; always suffering (he comes) to that miserable hot place that is ever ready (for the punishment of evildoers) There the cruel punishers have lighted four fires, and roast the sinners; they are roasted there like fishes put on the fire alive.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the right}} of the Sacred Tomb in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre is the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, which opens into the tenth-century church of the Apparition of Christ to His Blessed Mother, served by the Franciscan Fathers and {{containing}} their choir. Just off this chapel is the small damp monastery that thirteenth century has been the abode of the Fathers of the Holy Sepulchre. [...] The band is chosen every three months from the community of St. Saviour, to lead the difficult confined life. [...] Nonetheless, they always finds eager volunteers. The convent is accessible only from the basilica, which under Ottoman rule was in charge of Muslim guards. [...] The keys which lock the basilica shut the friars off from the outer world leaving their only means of communication as aperture in the main portal, through which they receive provisions from St. Saviour's. [...] Every afternoon the Fathers conduct a pilgrimage to the sanctuaries of the basilica, and at midnight, while chanting their Office, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> procession to the tomb of the Saviour, where they intone the Benedictus.|$|E

2500|$|In 1716, at a {{play at the}} New Inn, the Pretender was {{cheered and}} the {{audience}} booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king {{were said to be}} [...] "hiss'd at and curst as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the streets," [...] and in 1731 [...] "a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government." [...] But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland. Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in and the vestry of St Peter Mancroft resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, {{it was the end of}} the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the Battle of Culloden.|$|E
