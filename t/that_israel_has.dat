5|$|A limited {{operation}} {{was supported by}} Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. He argued <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available manpower. The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the Jewish population. A prolonged limited defensive war can best capitalize both weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israelâ€™s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

That song, and others by Naomi Shemer have become associated with those in Israel who believe <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> no obligation to forgo territories occupied in 1967.|$|E

25|$|Relations are {{typically}} tense. No Israeli citizens allowed entry following {{the assassination of}} Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh even if entering using a foreign passport. United Arab Emirates does not recognize Israel as a state, and the two countries do not have diplomatic and economic relations.

25|$|Lebanon's claim <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> {{not fully}} {{withdrawn}} (see Shebaa Farms) was explicitly {{rejected by the}} UN's Secretary-General's report which led to Resolution 1583. The Syrian occupation of Lebanon led to UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding the remaining 14,000 (of 50,000 originally) Syrian troop withdrawal and the dismantling of Hezbollah and Palestinian militias. On April 26, 2005, after 29 years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon, {{the last of the}} Syrian troops withdrew in accordance with the resolution.|$|E
25|$|Piper {{teaches that}} God {{has only one}} {{covenant}} people, mostly believing Jews in the Old Testament, and now that people consists of all the followers of Christ, or the Church, whether Jew or Gentile. Piper asserts <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> rights from God to dwell in that land, but {{not because they are}} merely Jewish, and Jews who reject Jesus as Messiah have no divine right of claim on those promises. Piper also believes that all Christians, Jew or Gentile, will inherit the earth, including the land of Israel, when Christ sets up the Millennial Kingdom in the Second Coming.|$|E

25|$|In the book, Manji {{says that}} Arabs {{have made a}} mistake by denying that Jews have a {{historical}} bond with Palestine. Manji writes that the Jews' historical roots stretch back to the land of Israel, and that {{they have a right to}} a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties, that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers, and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also writes <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> a free Arab press, that road signs bear Arabic translations, and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, when Ehud Barak was Israeli Prime Minister, Israel finally {{withdrew from}} the {{security}} zone to behind the Blue Line. Lebanon and Hezbollah continue to claim a small area called Shebaa Farms as Lebanese territory, but Israel insists that it is captured Syrian territory with the same status as the Golan Heights. The United Nations has not determined the final status of Shebaa Farms but has determined <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> complied with UNSC resolution 425. The UN Secretary-General had concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978, bringing closure to the 1982 invasion {{as far as the}} UN was concerned.|$|E
25|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views on}} the peace process held by US officials, citizens and lobbying groups. All recent US Presidents have maintained a policy that Israel must give {{up some of the}} land that it conquered in the 1967 war in order to achieve peace; that the Palestinians must actively prevent terrorism; and <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> an unconditional right to exist. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush publicly supported {{the creation of a new}} Palestinian state out of most of the current Palestinian territories, based on the idea of self-determination for the Palestinian people, and President Obama has continued that policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thought that peace can only be achieved through direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Obama outlined the pursuit of the two-state solution as American policy for achieving Palestinian aspirations, Israeli security, and a measure of stability in the Middle East.|$|E

5000|$|During his 2006 {{confirmation}} hearings before the United States Senate regarding his appointment as George W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates admitted <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>had</b> nuclear weapons. In his 2008 book The Culture of War, Martin van Creveld, {{a professor of}} military history at Israelâ€™s Hebrew University, wrote that since Gates admitted <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>had</b> nuclear weapons, any talk of Israel's nuclear weapons in Israel can lead to [...] "arrest, trial, and imprisonment." [...] Thus Israeli commentators talk about [...] "doomsday weapons" [...] and the Samson Option.|$|R
25|$|In 2006 Palestinian {{legislative}} elections Hamas won {{a majority}} in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority insisting that the Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> no right to exist and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must be wiped out. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish {{religious}} belief defining {{the land as}} where Jewish religious law prevailed and excluding territory where it was not applied, holds that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people based on the Torah, particularly the books of Genesis and Exodus, {{as well as on}} the later Prophets. According to the Book of Genesis, the land was first promised by God to the descendants of Abram; the text is explicit that this is a covenant between God and Abram for his descendants. Abram's name was later changed to Abraham, with the promise refined to pass through his son Isaac and to the Israelites, descendants of Jacob, Abraham's grandson. This belief is not shared by most adherents of replacement theology (or supersessionism), who hold the view that the Old Testament prophecies were superseded by the coming of Jesus, a view often repudiated by Christian Zionists as a theological error. Evangelical Zionists variously claim <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> title to the land by divine right, or by a theological, historical and moral grounding of attachment to the land unique to Jews (James Parkes), The idea that ancient religious texts can be warrant or divine right for a modern claim has often been challenged, and Israeli courts have rejected land claims based on religious motivations.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein {{claims that}} an {{equivalence}} exists between Hamas {{and the state}} of Israel in regards to the military policy of targeted killings during the Second Intifada. According to Finkelstein [...] "the record shows <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> routinely targeted civilians for killing" [...] and [...] "Israel indiscriminately kills civilians". He concludes that [...] "the argument, among human rights organizations at any rate is that ... in effect, thereâ€™s no difference between indiscriminately killing civilians and targeting civilians." ...|$|E
