5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> how {{embryonic}} {{development was}} controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E

5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. <b>The</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. <b>The</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E

25|$|The proton–neutron model {{explained}} <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> dinitrogen noticed independently by Ralph Kronig and Franco Rasetti. When 14N {{was proposed}} {{to consist of}} 3 pairs each of protons and neutrons, with an additional unpaired neutron and proton each contributing a spin of ħ {{in the same direction}} for a total spin of 1ħ, the model became viable. Soon, neutrons were used to naturally explain spin differences in many different nuclides in the same way.|$|E

25|$|With all {{of these}} pieces {{available}} by the 1930s, Gustav Embden proposed a detailed, step-by-step outline of that pathway we now know as glycolysis. The biggest difficulties in determining {{the intricacies of the}} pathway were due to the very short lifetime and low steady-state concentrations of the intermediates of the fast glycolytic reactions. By the 1940s, Meyerhof, Embden and many other biochemists had finally completed <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> glycolysis. The understanding of the isolated pathway has been expanded in the subsequent decades, to include further details of its regulation and integration with other metabolic pathways.|$|E
25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> motivation.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to the end}} of the Cold War, the {{consensus}} among students of large-scale violence was that ethnic groups should be considered irrational actors, or semi-rational at best. If true, general explanations of ethnic violence would be impossible. In the years since, however, scholarly consensus has shifted to consider that ethnic groups may in fact be counted as rational actors, and <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>of</b> their apparently irrational actions (for example, fighting over territory of little or no intrinsic worth) must therefore be explained in some other way. As a result, the possibility of a general explanation of ethnic violence has grown, and collaboration between comparativist and international-relations sub-fields has resulted in increasingly useful theories of ethnic conflict.|$|E
