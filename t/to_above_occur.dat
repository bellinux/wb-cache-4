40|$|On 20 January 2005, a solar {{energetic}} particle (SEP) event {{caused the}} largest recorded solar proton ground level event since 1956. Serendipitously, a balloon-borne experiment intended to measure effects of relativistic electron precipitation was aloft over Antarctica (∼ 32 km; near 70 °S, 345 °E geographic) throughout {{the duration of the}} SEP event, including the fast (∼ 6 min) onset. The balloon instrumentation included dc electric field and scalar electrical conductivity sensors. The observed conductivity increased by nearly a factor of 20 above ambient with the SEP event onset and returned to within a factor of two above normal levels within 17 h. Results from a newly developed, globally applicable atmosphere–ionosphere conductivity model based on the Sodankylä Ion and Neutral Chemistry (SIC) model suggest that proton-induced ionization was directly responsible for the observed conductivity increase at the balloon. Model input for this event included estimates of ionization from energetic particle precipitation and rigidity cutoffs. Altitudes between 20 and 150 km were considered during model runs. The results show a maximum conductivity increase near 60 km of more than 600 -fold directly after SEP event onset. Relatively small conductivity enhancements (two- to fivefold) are suggested <b>to</b> have <b>occurred</b> <b>above</b> 70 km as a result of SEP ionization, while almost no enhancement is thought <b>to</b> have <b>occurred</b> <b>above</b> 95 km.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{detachment}} {{a structure}} of strongly enhanced density develops close to the inner target. Its dynamics is approximated by those of radiative fluctuations appearing at a similar position and studied {{by means of a}} time-delay-estimation technique in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. Compared to theory the dynamics can be described as follows: at increasing density the ionization front moves upstream to reduce ionization radiation in order to balance the increased recombination radiation. The recombination zone stays close to the target strike point. The parallel motion of the ionization front is determined by the perpendicular neutral motion. The divertor nose constitutes an obstacle for the perpendicular neutral flux from the target <b>to</b> the region <b>above</b> the X-point. Passing into this shadow the neutral flux above the X-point is strongly reduced, the ionization front fades away and the heat flux from upstream can increase the temperature in the recombination region, subsequently reducing recombination and reforming an ionization front below the X-point. A cyclic reformation of the ionization front propagating from below <b>to</b> <b>above</b> the X-point <b>occurs</b> leading to a fluctuation as observed in the experiment...|$|R
