25|$|A queen {{is capable}} of mating {{starting}} 48 hours after emerging from the pupal stage. To find a male, queens fly to trees and bushes where males form aggregations. Males frequently groom their legs, antennae, and gasters throughout courtship, mating, and after contact with a queen. The queens have also been seen to groom the face and antennae, but only briefly. At the end of copulation, a queen is able to produce an olfactory or contact pheromone to signal release to the male. The queen also begins <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> the dorsal surface of the male’s gaster to further signal the end of copulation. Since both queens and males can mate multiple times, the queen’s signals are advantageous if her spermatheca is full, thereby preventing the waste of resources and time. Male having strong genitalic locks for mating is also advantageous, due to male-male competition, but can cause problems during disengagement. In the laboratory, both females and males have died during disengagement, sometimes leaving reproductive ends attached to the opposite sex.|$|E
2500|$|Tirggel {{are also}} very durable. Swiss writer Emanuel Stickelberger {{reported}} in 1939 that [...] "the tirggel has the admirable quality of not becoming stale, and the harder it gets, the more enjoyable is it <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> on." [...] On account of their elaborate ornamentation, traditionally manufactured tirggel are often not eaten at all for months or years and are kept as decorations instead.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} scene, a still-incensed Jerry stands {{with a wooden}} meat {{tenderizer}} over a bruised and injured Tom {{to keep him in}} line under a threat of getting hit, wanting him <b>to</b> spoon-feed <b>Nibbles</b> his milk. Tom timidly spoon-feeds milk <b>to</b> <b>Nibbles,</b> not <b>to</b> let one drop spill or else...! ...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{the trailer}} for the Masking Agents movie was uploaded, {{featuring}} the aforementioned Clifford Campbell and Cheque Records. The Drugs were signed <b>to</b> <b>Nibbles</b> Music soon after. In 2011, Masking Agents was released and was screened in Sydney and Melbourne.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{depends upon}} taste, as the monkey remarked when it took <b>to</b> <b>nibbling</b> {{the end of}} its own tail! If you like a thing, you take one view of it; if you don't like it, you take another view. Either view, if detailed, would be totally irreconcilable with the other.|$|R

6000|$|... "Thar is two kinds," [...] {{said the}} {{diplomatic}} Joe cheerfully, {{as he began}} <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> his, sideways, like a squirrel, [...] "light and heavy; some likes 'em one way, and some another." ...|$|E
6000|$|He plucked {{and began}} <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> {{a blade of}} grass. It was really not so much lying as his quick {{imagination}} that prompted him to add, [...] "In Papers, you know, and all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{impatient}} {{some little}} folks {{are and how}} fearful that their curiosity will not be satisfied" [...] remarked Old Mother Nature. [...] "As I was saying, {{this is all about}} our native Mice; that is, the Mice who belong to this country. And now we come <b>to</b> <b>Nibbler</b> the House Mouse, who, like Robber the Brown Rat, has no business here at all, but who has followed man {{all over the world and}} like Robber has become a pest to man." ...|$|R
50|$|Jerry then {{wipes his}} hands {{together}} and heads over <b>to</b> <b>Nibbles</b> and his noisemakers while Nibbles lights one more firecracker. With nowhere else to hide it, he stashes it into Jerry's noisemaker. Jerry pats Nibbles {{on the head and}} proceeds to blow his noisemaker. Knowing the consequences, <b>Nibbles</b> attempts <b>to</b> stop Jerry from doing so, but Jerry just pats him on the head again, then blows his noisemaker and the firecracker inside it explodes, giving him a blackface appearance. Jerry looks at Nibbles, annoyed, and Nibbles smiles innocently and plays with his noisemakers.|$|R
50|$|Some sheep scratch {{excessively}} {{and show}} patches of wool loss and lesions on the skin. Scratching sheep over the rump area may lead <b>to</b> a <b>nibbling</b> reflex, which is characteristic for the condition.|$|R

60|$|And then we drifted, {{like two}} trout, {{out of our}} cool pool in the great hotel and began <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of Broadway. And our {{question}} of dramatic art was unsettled.|$|E
50|$|Tom and Jerry {{comic books}} {{have been out of}} print in the United States since 1991. Not surprisingly, as time passes, fewer English-speaking staffers working on modern Tom and Jerry {{products}} remember the comics and the continuity they introduced. For this reason, the character's name has sometimes changed back <b>to</b> <b>Nibbles</b> in new product, notably the Tom and Jerry movies, Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring, and the new TV series, Tom and Jerry Tales. The reference books Hanna-Barbera Cartoons by Michael Mallory and The Hanna-Barbera Treasury by Jerry Beck refer to the character only as Nibbles, without mentioning his alternate name at all.|$|R

60|$|Then {{there was}} the fishing. One {{did not have to}} go in search of it, for it was there at the rail. A three-inch steel hook, {{on the end of a}} stout line, with a piece of white rag for bait, was all that was {{necessary}} to catch bonitas weighing from ten to twenty-five pounds. Bonitas feed on flying-fish, wherefore they are unaccustomed <b>to</b> <b>nibbling</b> at the hook. They strike as gamely as the gamest fish in the sea, and their first run is something that no man who has ever caught them will forget. Also, bonitas are the veriest cannibals. The instant one is hooked he is attacked by his fellows. Often and often we hauled them on board with fresh, clean-bitten holes in them the size of teacups.|$|R
5000|$|Nibbles {{arrives at}} Jerry's mousehole, {{and as he}} tries to snatch cheese from a trap, Jerry discovers he has been asked <b>to</b> have <b>Nibbles</b> as a guest for Thanksgiving, with a note {{attached}} saying [...] "he's always hungry." [...] Jerry's cupboards are empty, so he leads <b>Nibbles</b> <b>to</b> a bowl of cream where Tom is sleeping. After Nibbles sips the cream, Mammy Two Shoes places a turkey on the table. <b>Nibbles</b> proceeds <b>to</b> eat certain foods from the table, while Jerry dresses him and Nibbles as pilgrims, but after Nibbles swallows an orange and inflates, Jerry hits Nibbles with a knife and the orange flies into Tom's mouth, waking him up.|$|R
60|$|Crouching {{beside the}} brook, I waited {{until one of}} the {{diminutive}} purple whales rose <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> at the long grasses which overhung the water, and then, like the beast of prey that man really is, I sprang upon my victim, appeasing my hunger while he yet wriggled to escape.|$|E
60|$|When {{the stillness}} was once more perfect, Alan {{shouldered}} the portmanteau, carried it in, and shut {{and locked the}} garden door; and then, once more, abstraction seemed to fall upon him, and he stood {{with his hand on}} the key, until the cold began <b>to</b> <b>nibble</b> at John's fingers.|$|E
60|$|With {{these words}} the Ork squatted down beside them. Very reluctantly Cap'n Bill drew another biscuit {{from his pocket}} and held it out.

60|$|Having paddled {{down three}} {{quarters}} of the lake, we came to a standstill while my companion let down for fish. In the midst of our dreams of giant lake trout, even then supposed <b>to</b> be <b>nibbling,</b> our fisherman drew up a diminutive red perch, and we took up our paddles.|$|R
