5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, the {{formation}} of the Commando unit was changed. Each Commando now consisted of a small headquarters group, five fighting troops, a heavy weapons troop, and a signals platoon.

Their transport now consisted of the commanding officer's car, 15 motorcycles (six with side cars), ten 15 cwt trucks, and three 3-ton trucks. <b>The</b> <b>heavy</b> weapons troop had seven Jeeps and trailers and one Jeep for each of the fighting troops and the headquarters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the kinematics of the throw with the competition hammer (7. 26 kg) and <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer (8. 0 kg). Sixteen male hammer throwers threw hammers of both weights at maximum effort. Utilizing 3 high-speed video cameras (300 fps), three-dimensional coordinates of the hammer head and 25 landmarks on the body were obtained by the direct linear transformation method. Hammer head velocity and distance thrown with <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer were significantly lower than for the throw with the competition hammer. Durations of the turn and double support phase (DSP) in the throw with <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer were significantly longer than with the competition hammer. Focusing on changes in the velocity of the hammer head, the duration of acceleration with <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer during <b>the</b> 1 st and 2 nd turns was longer than for the competition hammer. The Y component of displacement of the center of gravity for <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer was longer in every phase than for the competition hammer. These results suggest that the throw with <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer can be an effective training method for acquiring a longer movement of the center of gravity toward the throwing direction during the DSP and longer acceleration of the hammer head...|$|R
