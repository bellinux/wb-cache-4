Since the independence in 2008, the economy has grown every year. Despite declining foreign assistance, growth of GDP averaged over 5% a year. This was despite the Global financial crisis of 2009 and the subsequent Eurozone crisis. Additionally, the inflation rate was low.

Additionally, <b>transition</b> <b>economies</b> with currency boards experience higher real GDP per-capita growth compared to both pegged and floating regimes.
