40|$|The {{results of}} five {{experimental}} investigations on the initiation, propagation and <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> {{have shown that}} the wave behavior depends on the relative rates of gasdynamic expansion and chemical energy release occurring within the cellular detonation front. The former rate is controlled by the "boundary conditions" defined by the physical system, while the latter rate depends on the chemical and physical properties of the combustible mixture. The fractional increase (xi) {{in the area of the}} post-shock "stream tube", evaluated over a chemical kinetic distance equal to the cell length, has been identified as a parameter which satisfactorily characterizes the competition between these two rate processes. For (xi) less than about 20 %, the chemical processes survive the gasdynamic expansion and self-sustained propagation is possible. However, under these "supercritical" conditions, the wave propagates with a velocity deficit which appears to be a universal and theoretically predictable function of (xi). For (xi) greater than 20 %, the shock/reaction zone coupling breaks down, resulting in failure of the wave. The "critical" conditions for the propagation of detonation waves subjects to a wide range of expansion inducing mechanisms, including viscous boundary layers, compressible boundary gases and yielding walls, are all found to be consistent with the 20 % criterion. However, the criterion becomes inapplicable as the cell size approaches the characteristic transverse dimension of the geometry. In the case of direct initiation or <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> from one geometry to another, the critical conditions are shown to be linked to the requirement for the diverging wave to exceed some minimum radius of curvature. Such radius is geometry dependent and satisfies the stream tube criterion. The role of the "initial conditions" in this type of problem is to guarantee survival of the wave until it achieves the minimum radius for which shock/reaction zone coupling, and hence self-substance, are possible...|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{reliable}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> {{waves to}} a pulse detonation engine combustor (detonation chamber), the authors propose a pulse detonation engine initiator {{that uses a}} cylindrical reflector downstream of a predetonator exit. The detonation wave propagates around the reflector to change the wave shape in three transition stages: from a planar detonation wave in the predetonator to an expanding cylindrical detonation wave, from the cylindrical wave to a planar toroidal detonation wave, and from the toroidal wave to a planar detonation wave in the detonation chamber. The cylindrical wave propagates along a cylindrical path between the reflector and front wall of the detonation chamber, and the toroidal wave propagates along an annular path between the reflector and sidewall of the detonation chamber. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the influence of the gap width L of the annular path on the transition stages from cylindrical to toroidal and from toroidal to planar. A series of experiments that filled the entire test section with the driver gas mixture (stoichiometric hydrogen oxygen mixture) showed that the expanding cylindrical detonation wave was sufficiently strong to survive the rarefaction waves from the corners of the reflector at all of the investigated annular gap widths (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm) and was transmitted to the planar toroidal wave successfully in all cases. When the strength of the cylindrical detonation wave was under a supercritical condition for diffraction at the reflector corner, the necessary filling distance for the driver gas was predicted well by the Whitham theory. A second series of experiments showed the influence of the annular gap width on the detonation transition from the planar toroidal detonation wave to the planar detonation wave. Two different types of detonation transitions termed "continuous transition" and "temporal quenching" were observed. The threshold value of L/lambda for continuous transition is approximately four...|$|E

40|$|Detonation {{diffraction}} has been, and remains, {{an active}} area <b>of</b> research. However, <b>detonation</b> diffraction into a confined volume, and specifically the transformation <b>of</b> a planar <b>detonation</b> into a cylindrical detonation, {{is an area}} which has received little attention. Experimental work needs to be conducted on detonation diffraction into a confined volume to better understand how {{the interaction of the}} diffracted shock wave with a confining wall impacts the detonation diffraction process. Therefore, a facility was constructed to study this problem, and experiments were conducted to determine under what conditions a planar detonation could be successfully transformed into a cylindrical detonation. Four different fuel-oxidizer mixtures, C?H?+ 2. 5 O?, C?H?+ 4 O?, C?H?+ 3 O? and H?+ 0. 5 O?, were tested in this study using a combination of pressure transducers and soot foil records as diagnostics. Three different regimes of successful transmission; spontaneous re-ignition, continuous reflected re-initiation, and discontinuous reflected re-initiation, were identified. The detonation cell size and the distance from the tube exit to the confining wall, or gap size, were determined {{to be the most important}} parameters in the transmission process and a linear correlation for determining whether or not transmission will be successful for a given set of initial conditions was developed for gap sizes between 10 and 35 mm. For gap sizes smaller than 10 mm or gap size larger than 35 mm the linear correlation does not apply. Finally, the results of this study are compared to results on detonation diffraction into a confined volume available in the literature and explanations for any disagreements are given. This study showed that when compared to <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a <b>detonation</b> into an unconfined volume, the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a <b>detonation</b> into a confined volume, for the majority of gap sizes, is possible for a wider range of conditions.

From our point of view, these microscopic processes underlie the more complex interactions which cannot be described through thermodynamic and macroscopic studies alone. It is our belief that the molecules of energetic materials are structurally different from those related but non-explosive materials.

40|$|When a plane {{detonation}} propagating {{through an}} explosive comes {{into contact with}} a bounding explosive, different types of diffraction patterns, which may result in the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a <b>detonation</b> into the bounding mixture, are observed. The nature of these diffraction patterns and the mode <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> <b>transmission</b> depend on {{the properties of the}} primary and bounding explosives. An experimental and analytical study of such diffractions, which are fundamental to many explosive applications, has been conducted in a two channel shock tube, using H 2 -O 2 mixtures of different equivalence ratios as the primary and bounding or secondary explosive. The combination of mixtures was varied from rich primary / lean secondary to lean primary / rich secondary since the nature of the diffraction was found to depend on whether the Chapman-Jouguet velocity of the primary mixture, D p, was greater than or less than that of the secondary mixture, D s. Schlieren framing photographs of the different diffraction patterns were obtained and used to measure shock and oblique detonation wave angles and velocities for the different diffraction patterns, and these were compared with the results of a steady-state shock-polar solution of the diffraction problem. Two basic types of diffraction and modes <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> reinitiation were observed. When D p > D s, an oblique shock connecting the primary detonation to an oblique detonation in the secondary mixture was observed. With D p D s.

40|$|A device {{has been}} {{developed}} which uses shock focusing to enhance the <b>transmission</b> e±ciency <b>of</b> an initiator tube when used with pulse detonation engines. The initiator is capable <b>of</b> initiating <b>detonations</b> in ethylene-air and propane-air mixtures using less initiator fuel than is used in a conventional initiator tube. This toroidal initiator uses a single spark {{and an array of}} small-diameter channels to generate and merge many detonation waves to create a single detonation wave with a toroidal front. The collapsing front generates a high-temperature and pressure focal region. This region of high energy density is used to facilitate more e±cient <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> wave from the initiator into the fuel-air mixture. The development of this device was detailed in previous work (Jackson, S. I. and Shepherd, J. E., Systems for Pulse Detonation Engines, " AIAA Paper 2002 3627, July 2002).

Results presented include temporal history of pressure near the focus of the collapsing torus and images of the front luminosity. The critical amount of initiator gas required to detonate propane-air and ethylene-air mixtures is then discussed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{diverging}} spherical {{detonation wave}} in gaseous explosives is obtained either with a point source of explosion of energy E {{or through the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a plane <b>detonation</b> from a cylindrical tube of diameter d into a large volume. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> initiation in both cases {{is based on the}} shock to detonation transition. The experimental critical conditions lead to an initiation criterion for detonation resulting from the competition between the expansion behind the leading shock wave on one hand and the shock-induced chemical heat release on the other. Whatever the type of ignition source, the detonation is obtained when the radius of curvature of the wave overcomes a particular critical value & whose size includes a constant and large number of cell width hcj (R, 20 hcj) and then can be considered as intrinsic to the detonative mixture used. kj, which is the mean size of the cellular structure <b>of</b> a CJ <b>detonation,</b> is proportional to the global chemical induction length Li, calculated in the ZND scheme, by also a large factor (generally more than 10).

40|$|Initiation <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the {{cylindrical}} geometry {{is important}} in validating a general theory of initiation, and has particular significance to the interaction of high velocity projectiles with combustible gas. In the present study, an experimental investigation of the direct initiation <b>of</b> gaseous <b>detonations</b> by a line source of condensed explosives (detonating cord) is presented. Due to the high velocity <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the condensed explosive cord (6 [...] 7 km/s), the rapid chemical energy release along its length generates a quasi-cylindrical blast wave in the surrounding combustible mixture. For a sufficiently strong detonating cord, the generated blast wave is observed to decay to a stable Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conical detonation. Below a certain critical energy, the blast wave decays to low velocities without initiating detonation. In the critical regime of initiation, measurements of the combustion front velocity and direct flow visualization indicate that the blast wave decays to sub-CJ velocities before the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation.</b> The onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> is associated with discrete explosion centers. This phenomenon is similar {{to what has been}} previously observed for spherical initiation, suggesting a universal mechanism <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> initiation. The critical shock radius at which the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> occurs is correlated to the detonation cell size (lambda) of the mixture, consistently yielding a radius of 4 to 8 lambda.
