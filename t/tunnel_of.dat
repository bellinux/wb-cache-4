The station opened on 20 August 2003, {{as part of the}} first section of the Ring Line to Storo. The station is served by lines 4, 5 and 6 of the metro, as well as several local bus services. Artistic effort was put into the {{construction}} of the station, and the escalators were built into the <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> Light exhibition.

In 2005, BI, with 8000 students and faculty, {{moved into a new}} campus across the street from Nydalen Station. Nydalen is the only underground station on the Ring Line. The escalators leading down to the platform features The <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> Light, an artistic presentation of sound and colour around the passengers as they ascend from or to descend to the station. The artwork contains 1800 lights and 44 speakers. Nydalen also serves as a bus hub.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Fair, the park's owner, {{acquired}} Knott's Berry Farm—the first {{park with}} a Halloween Haunt—in 1997, and implemented the event throughout the chain, starting with Cedar Point. At its debut, {{there were only}} two haunt attractions, Eerie Manor and Cedar Point Cemetery. Guests could travel on the Cedar Point Spooky Express through haunted lagoons and graveyards. The first new attraction, Toxic <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> Terror, was introduced in 1998. Camp Spooky debuted a year later with children's activities in Camp Snoopy. In 2000, Cedar Point Cemetery was re-themed into Pharaoh's Secret. The park added three attractions in 2001, Eerie Manor was re-themed into Undertaker U., and Fright Zone and Magical House on Boo Hill were added.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place {{at the peak of the}} February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included a line in the script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{called the}} Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo, the award was first {{presented}} to Bruce Springsteen in 1988 for the album <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> Love. Since then, the award {{was presented in}} 1992 and 1994, and has been awarded each year since 2005. Beginning with the 2005 ceremony, {{the name of the}} award was changed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For these years, the award combined and replaced the gender-specific awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. This fusion has been criticized, especially when females are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E

The <b>Tunnel</b> <b>of</b> Pride was next formed for the 1995 Notre Dame game, which the Buckeyes also won. In each home game against Michigan since, the tradition has been repeated.|$|E
