25|$|The {{government}} broadened {{land ownership}} by returning land {{that had been}} sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax. <b>To</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> more incentives {{to participate in the}} market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers. The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants. A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. These restrictions on domestic resource exploration, as well as on foreign trade, are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence, by which the Western world overtook China economically.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside the feeling of being connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow people down and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E

500|$|The {{earthquake}} made Yamaguchi rethink {{his reasons}} why Sakanaction make music. The {{meaning of a}} documentary-themed album changed after the earthquake, as the band {{felt as if they}} did not have a heavy album that reflected these events, then it could not truly be a documentary. Yamaguchi wrote the songs [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] and [...] "Years" [...] directly after the earthquake, as therapy for himself. Realizing that rock bands were no longer a staple of Japanese charts in the early 2010s, Yamaguchi wanted to create a Sakanaction-style pop song that would resonate with a general pop audience, one that listened to idol groups such as Girls' Generation, TVXQ and AKB48. As rock music was no longer so prominent in Japan, Yamaguchi felt that the reasons for people listening to music had changed over time, and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment-focused music in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>people</b> music that they look for.|$|E

[...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view.
