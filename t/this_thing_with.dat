It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> these moths in it, so I guess I {{have to deal with}} it. They're furry and they carry dust. I found out in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E
500|$|In a June 2011 Kerrang! interview, Lee {{said that}} the album would be self-titled and was [...] "about the band; it's more of a band record." [...] Lee {{explained}} that the concept [...] "to me is about falling back in love with <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> Evanescence, with what I've obsessed over for a decade, longer than that." [...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, {{it was just the}} only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love with this thing in a major way." [...] In an MTV News interview, she said that 16 songs had been recorded but not all would be included on the album. It was later decided to release two versions of the album: a deluxe edition with all 16 songs and a standard edition with 12.|$|E

It would reflect upon her, she thought, {{if the truth}} came out, so I acquiesced, I left the house unseen. All these days I have had to carry the burden of <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> me.

6000|$|As {{the carved}} beauty of great buildings, {{so is the}} graven beauty of death, the unimaginable wonder of the {{abandoned}} thing lying so quiet, marvelling at its resemblance to what once lived! How strange this thing, still stamped by all that it had felt, wanted, loved, and hated, by all its dumb, hard, commonplace existence! <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the calm, pathetic look of one who asks of his own fled spirit: Why have you abandoned me? ...|$|E

You are judging <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> your mind on the past. You're not considering the rough wild raw life we cowboys have lived.

6000|$|Lord Henry {{sat back}} in his chair, and tugged gently at his ashen tuft of beard, his florid face {{overcast}} and thoughtful. There was something here he did not understand at all. [...] "Mistress Rosamund," [...] he said quietly, [...] "let me exhort you to consider the gravity of your words. You are virtually accusing one who is no longer able to defend himself; if your story is established, infamy will rest for ever upon the memory of Lionel Tressilian.

Did Lionel Tressilian admit the truth of <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> which you say that the prisoner charged him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Marjorie's {{feelings}} {{for the rest}} of the day are only to be accounted for on the supposition that she was overwrought. She had a preposterous reaction. She had done <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> her eyes open after days of deliberation, and now she felt as though she was caught in a trap. The clearest thing in her mind was that Mr. Magnet had taken hold of her and kissed her, kissed her on the lips, and that presently he would do it again. And also she was asking herself with futile reiteration why she had got into debt at Oxbridge? Why she had got into debt? For such silly little things too! ...|$|E
60|$|So absorbed was I in my {{own safety}} and {{progress}} that I did not pause to think (as I have often thought since) of the full meaning of this, though I had marked it for many years. The support given to Wilkinson's plots, to Clark's expedition, was merely the outward and visible sign of the onward sweep of a resistless race. In spite of untold privations and hardships, of cruel warfare and massacre, these people had toiled over the mountains into this land, and impatient of check or hindrance would, even as Clark had predicted, when their numbers were sufficient leap the Mississippi. Night or day, drunk or sober, they spoke of <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> an ever increasing vehemence, and no man of reflection who had read their history could say {{that they would be}} thwarted. One day Louisiana would be theirs and their children's for the generations to come. One day Louisiana would be American.|$|E

60|$|In truth {{the mastery}} of flying {{was the work of}} {{thousands}} of men--this man a suggestion and that an experiment, until at last only one vigorous intellectual effort was needed to finish the work. But the inexorable injustice of the popular mind has decided that of all these thousands, one man, and that a man who never flew, should be chosen as the discoverer, just as it has chosen to honour Watt as the discoverer of steam and Stephenson of the steam-engine. And surely of all honoured names none is so grotesquely and tragically honoured as poor Filmer's, the timid, intellectual creature who solved the problem over which the world had hung perplexed and a little fearful for so many generations, the man who pressed the button that has changed peace and warfare and well-nigh every condition of human life and happiness. Never has that recurring wonder of the littleness of the scientific man {{in the face of the}} greatness of his science found such an amazing exemplification. Much concerning Filmer is, and must remain, profoundly obscure--Filmers attract no Boswells--but the essential facts and the concluding scene are clear enough, and there are letters, and notes, and casual allusions to piece the whole together. And this is the story one makes, putting <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> that, of Filmer's life and death.|$|E
6000|$|Though the {{conviction}} that he must never disclose his secret to his mother was originally an unmeditated, and as it were, an inspired one; yet now he was almost pains-taking in scrutinizing the entire circumstances of the matter, in order that nothing might be overlooked. For already he vaguely felt, that upon the concealment, or the disclosure of <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> reference to his mother, hinged his whole future course of conduct, his whole earthly weal, and Isabel's. But the more and the more that he pondered upon it, the more and the more fixed became his original conviction. He considered {{that in the case}} of a disclosure, all human probability pointed to his mother's scornful rejection of his suit as a pleader for Isabel's honorable admission into the honorable mansion of the Glendinnings. Then in that case, unconsciously thought Pierre, I shall have given the deep poison of a miserable truth to my mother, without benefit to any, and positive harm to all. And through Pierre's mind there then darted a baleful thought; how that the truth should not always be paraded; how that sometimes a lie is heavenly, and truth infernal. Filially infernal, truly, thought Pierre, if I should by one vile breath of truth, blast my father's blessed memory in the bosom of my mother, and plant the sharpest dagger of grief in her soul. I will not do it! ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{entered the}} gateway together, and before us lay {{the square of}} the farm, strewn with litter, and from within the byre we heard the milk ring in the pails, for the women were milking the cows. And there we both stood astonished, for we saw the Maid as never yet I had seen her. She was bareheaded, but wore the rest of her harness, holding in her hand a measure of corn. All the fowls of the air seemed to be about her, expecting their meat. But she was not {{throwing}} the grain among them, for she stood as still as a graven image, and, wonderful to tell, a dove was perched on her shoulder, and a mavis was nestling in her breast, while many birds flew round her, chiefly doves with burnished plumage, flitting as it were lovingly, and softly brushing her now and again with their wings. Many a time had I heard it said that, while she was yet a child, the wild birds would come and nestle in the bosom of the Maid, but I had never believed the tale. Yet now I saw <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> mine own eyes, a fair sight and a marvellous, so beautiful she looked, with head unhelmeted, and the wild fowl and tame flitting about her and above her, the doves crooning sweetly in their soft voices. Then her lips moved, and she spoke-- ...|$|E

60|$|We {{had already}} risen to go, and the vestiaire {{was on his}} way towards us, bearing my hat and coat, when Monsieur Carvin, who had hurried out a moment before, reappeared, {{ushering}} in a new arrival. The events that followed have always seemed a little confused to me. My first thought was that this was indeed a nightmare into which I had wandered. The slight unreality which had hung like a cloud over the whole of the evening, the strangeness of my being there with such a companion, the curious atmosphere of the place, which so far had completely puzzled me,--these things may all have served to heighten the illusion. Yet it seemed to me then that, dreaming or waking, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> which I was confronted was the last impossibility. I suppose that I must have stared at him like some wild creature, for the conversation around us suddenly stopped. Standing upon the threshold, looking around him with the happy air of an habitue, I saw this man to whom I owed my presence in Paris, this man concerning whom I had sworn that if ever I should meet him face to face my hand should be upon his throat. I remember nothing of my progress, but I know that I stood before him before he was conscious even of my presence. I addressed him by name. I believe that even my voice was not upraised.|$|E

"Owing {{it as we}} do," [...] he said, [...] "very, very {{largely to}} our friend Gosse, to that peculiar, that honest but restless and, as it were, at times almost malignantly ambitious {{organizing}} energy of our friend, I cannot altogether--altogether, even if in any case I should have taken so extreme, so devastatingly isolating a step as, to put it violently, stand out; yet I must confess to a considerable anxiety, a kind of distress, an apprehension, the terror, so to speak, of the kerbstone, at all this stream of intellectual trafficking, of going to and fro, in a superb and towering manner enough no doubt, but still essentially going to and fro rather than {{in any of the}} completed senses of the word getting there, that does so largely constitute the aggregations and activities we are invited to traverse. My poor head, such as it is and as much as it can and upon such legs--save the mark!--as it can claim, must, I suppose, play its inconsiderable part among the wheels and the rearings and the toots and the whistles and all this uproar, this--Mm, Mm!--let us say, this infernal uproar, of the occasion; and if at times one has one's doubts before plunging in, whether after all, after the plunging and the dodging and the close shaves and narrow squeaks, one does begin to feel that one is getting through, whether after all one will get through, and whether indeed there is any getting through, whether, to deepen and enlarge and display one's doubt quite openly, there is in truth any sort of ostensible and recognizable other side attainable and definable at all, whether to put <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> a lucidity that verges on the brutal, whether our amiable and in most respects our adorable Gosse isn't indeed preparing here and now, not the gathering together of a conference but the assembling, the meet, so to speak, of a wild-goose chase of an entirely desperate and hopeless description." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{have been}} pretty much every where in our gondola. We have bought beads and {{photographs}} in the stores, and wax matches in the Great Square of St. Mark. The last remark suggests a digression. Every body goes to this vast square in the evening. The military bands play in the centre of it and countless couples of ladies and gentlemen promenade {{up and down on}} either side, and platoons of them are constantly drifting away toward the old Cathedral, and by the venerable column with the Winged Lion of St. Mark on its top, and out to where the boats lie moored; and other platoons are as constantly arriving from the gondolas and joining the great throng. Between the promenaders and the side-walks are seated hundreds and hundreds of people at small tables, smoking and taking granita, (a first cousin to ice-cream;) on the side-walks are more employing themselves in the same way. The shops in {{the first floor of the}} tall rows of buildings that wall in three sides of the square are brilliantly lighted, the air is filled with music and merry voices, and altogether the scene is as bright and spirited and full of cheerfulness as any man could desire. We enjoy it thoroughly. Very many of the young women are exceedingly pretty and dress with rare good taste. We are gradually and laboriously learning the ill-manners of staring them unflinchingly in the face--not because such conduct is agreeable to us, but because it is the custom of the country and they say the girls like it. We wish to learn all the curious, outlandish ways of all the different countries, so that we can [...] "show off" [...] and astonish people when we get home. We wish to excite the envy of our untraveled friends with our strange foreign fashions which we can't shake off. All our passengers are paying strict attention to <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> the end in view which I have mentioned. The gentle reader will never, never know what a consummate ass he can become, until he goes abroad. I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass. If the case be otherwise, I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and call him brother. I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own heart when I shall have finished my travels.|$|E
