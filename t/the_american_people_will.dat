60|$|If I {{be wrong}} on this {{question}} of constitutional power, my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not be constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is not in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety {{as it is in}} times of profound peace and public security. The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I can no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take no strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one.

60|$|Then as {{to their}} power of paying the bill! We are told that the wealth of a nation {{consists}} in its labor, and that that nation is the most wealthy which can turn out of hand {{the greatest amount of}} work. If this be so, the American States must form a very wealthy nation, and as such be able to support a very heavy burden. No one, I presume, doubts that that nation which works the most, or works rather to the best effect, is the richest. On this account England is richer than other countries, and is able to bear, almost without the sign of an effort, a burden which would crush any other land. But of this wealth the States own almost as much as Great Britain owns. The population of the Northern States is industrious, ambitious of wealth, and capable of work as is our population. It possesses, or is possessed by, that restless longing for labor which creates wealth almost unconsciously. Whether this man be rich or be a bankrupt, whether the bankers of that city fail or make their millions, the creative energies of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> not become dull. Idleness is impossible to them, and therefore poverty is impossible. Industry and intellect together will always produce wealth; and neither industry nor intellect is ever wanting to an American. They are the two gifts with which the fairy has endowed him. When she shall have added honesty as a third, the tax-gatherer can desire no better country in which to exercise his calling.|$|E
60|$|I {{will leave}} it to Americans {{themselves}} to say whether that disintegration of the States will, should it ever be realized, imply that they have failed in their political undertaking. If they do not protest that it argues failure, I {{do not think that}} their feelings will be hurt by such protestations on the part of others. I have said that the blunder made by the founders of the nation with regard to slavery has brought with it this secession as its punishment. But such punishments come generally upon nations as great mercies. Ireland's famine was the punishment of her imprudence and idleness, but it has given to her prosperity and progress. And indeed, to speak with more logical correctness, the famine was no punishment to Ireland, nor will secession be a punishment to the Northern States. In the long result, step will have gone on after step, and effect will have followed cause, till <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> at last acknowledge that all these matters have been arranged for their advantage and promotion. It may be that a nation now and then goes to the wall, and that things go from bad to worse with a large people. It has been so with various nations, and with many people since history was first written. But when it has been so, the people thus punished have been idle and bad. They have not only done evil in their generation, but have done more evil than good, and have contributed their power to the injury rather than to the improvement of mankind. It may be that this or that national fault may produce or seem to produce some consequent calamity. But the balance of good or evil things which fall to a people's share will indicate with certainty their average conduct as a nation. The one will be the certain sequence of the other. If it be that the Americans of the Northern States have done well in their time, that they have assisted in the progress of the world, and made things better for mankind rather than worse, then they will come out of this trouble without eventual injury. That which came in the guise of punishment for a special fault, will {{be a part of the}} reward resulting from good conduct in the general. And as to this matter of slavery, in which I think that they have blundered both politically and morally, has it not been found impossible hitherto for them to cleanse their hands of that taint? But that which they could not do for themselves the course of events is doing for them. If secession establish herself, though it be only secession of the Gulf States, the people of the United States will soon be free from slavery.|$|E

50|$|The Tet {{offensive}} {{is widely}} viewed as {{a turning point in}} the war despite the high cost to the communists (approximately 32,000 killed and about 5,800 captured) for what appeared at the time to be small gains. Although they managed to retain control of some of the rural areas, the communists were forced out of all of the towns and cities, except Huế, within a few weeks. Nevertheless, the offensive emphasized to the Johnson administration that victory in Vietnam would require a greater commitment of men and resources than <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> were <b>willing</b> to invest. What shocked and dismayed <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public was <b>the</b> realization that either it had been lied to or that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> military command had been dangerously overoptimistic in its appraisal of the situation in Vietnam.

5000|$|Bush {{has stated}} that [...] "We do not torture." [...] Yet, many people and governments and {{non-governmental}} organizations disagree and have staged several protests. [...] These sentiments are partly {{a result of the}} Pentagon's suggestion that the president can decide whether normal strictures on torture still apply if it outweighs the security of the nation, and because the Bush administration has repeatedly acted against attempts to restrict controversial interrogation techniques, including signing statements by Bush to exclude himself from the laws created by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 as well as vetoing legislation that would have made waterboarding and other coercive interrogation methods illegal. Furthermore, some are concerned by the Bush Administration's use of Extraordinary rendition, where individuals are sent to other countries where torture can easily occur without any form of oversight. Bush defends this practice on the basis that: ... the United States government has an obligation to protect <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> It's in our country's interests to find those who would do harm to us and get them out of harm's way. And we will do so within the law, and we will do so in honoring our commitment not to torture people. And we expect the countries where we send somebody to, not to torture, as well.

25|$|In June 2017, the Senate voted 98 to 2 for a {{bill that}} had been {{initially}} drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia′s continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the 2016 election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as Iran, and North Korea; the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law. An identical bill was introduced by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in July and passed in the house on July 25, with 419 votes in favor and 3 against. On July 27, the bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate, which provoked Russia′s president Putin into pledging response to ″this kind of insolence towards our country″. On August 2, president Donald Trump signed the bill into law (the ″Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act″). Simultaneously, the president issued two separate, simultaneous statements. One of those said, ″While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions″. The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress, giving them time to reverse such a move. It targets Russia's defense industry by harming Russia's ability to export weapon, and allows the U.S. to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources. One of Trump′s statements noted that ″by limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill {{makes it harder for}} the United States to strike good deals for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people,</b> and <b>will</b> drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.″ The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of retaliatory measure {{on the part of the}} European Union.|$|R

40|$|The decades {{immediately}} following World War II were prosperous but filled with great inequalities. Many social change movements, including the War on Poverty, attempted to eliminate these inequalities. Yet, programs as large and far reaching as these required many {{changes to the}} society itself. President Lyndon Johnson and Dr. Julius Richmond, director of Head Start, agreed that certain societal factors were necessary before social change could occur. Johnson felt that these conditions were 2 ̆ 2 a recognition of need, a willingness to act, and someone to lead the effort 2 ̆ 2 (Johnson The Vantage Point 70). The widespread existence of poverty in Post World War II America 2 ̆ 7 s affluence helped America recognize the need that existed among its poor. Books such as John Kenneth Galbraith 2 ̆ 7 s The Affluent Society, Harry Caudill Night Comes to the Cumberlands, and the most influential of all, Michael Harrington 2 ̆ 7 s The Other America showed the affluent society the existence and the need of their poor counterparts. Many changes had to occur before <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> were <b>willing</b> to help the poor. These changes began in the 1930 s with the programs of the New Deal. The acceptance {{of the concept of}} structural poverty, poverty that was intertwined within the system and not the fault of the individual, increased the public 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to help the underprivileged. The inequalities brought to light by the Civil Rights movement raised social consciousness about many oppressed groups, including the poor. Finally, President John F. Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s assassination touched the hearts of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> and made them more willing to help their fellows. Lyndon Johnson saw himself in the role of strong leader, his final requirement. He felt that his poor background and work with poverty-stricken children helped qualify him for this task. His work with the National Youth Administration also prepared him to fight poverty. Gallup polls showed that before the War on Poverty began many people favored fighting poverty over balancing the budget (Schwarz 159). As the programs expanded, support for them grew. Statistics show that these programs significantly reduced poverty in America...|$|R
