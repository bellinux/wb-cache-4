5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|On the day Alexander was born, Philip was {{preparing}} a siege {{on the city}} of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, {{to show that he}} was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.|$|E

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
25|$|A {{complimentary}} {{definition of}} principal root (though not formally defined or universally accepted) is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is always the}} complex root that has the least value of the argument among all roots; here “argument” means the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive real axis and the line joining the complex number to the origin.|$|E

25|$|On September 26, 2008, Army Colonel Lawrence Morris, Guantanamo's Chief Prosecutor, {{asked for}} a new {{sentencing}} hearing for Hamdan. He asked that Hamdan not be granted credit for time served, and serve an additional six years. Defense continued <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could continue to hold enemy combatant captives as detainees after they served their sentences assigned by the Military Commissions.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{sense in}} which this kind of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes so far as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E
25|$|On 24 February 2012, {{the court}} {{heard from a}} {{forensic}} imagery expert, Jacqueline Butterwick, who had analysed footage on behalf of police. She told the court that the CCTV footage of a person on Thistle Street bore enough similarities to other CCTV images of Suzanne Pilley taken that day, for her <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> definitely was Ms Pilley. She was 20 metres from the entrance to her work.|$|E

25|$|Fielding for a fast bowler {{is usually}} aggressive, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is set up}} for the purpose of getting a wicket rather than {{preventing}} the flow of runs. On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required. As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling – that task is better suited to spin bowlers.|$|E
25|$|In response, many {{communities}} began passing ordinances that either restricted or prohibited their sale outright. The head shops and other sellers of paraphernalia challenged them in court. While some surivived, many early ones were overturned by courts as vague {{due to their}} drafters' lack of familiarity with the targeted items {{and the fact that}} most smoking equipment {{can also be used to}} smoke tobacco and other legal substances, therefore making it hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is intended and sold only with illegal use in mind.|$|E
25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it. That is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E
50|$|In ring theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a semisimple algebra is an {{associative}} artinian algebra over a field which has trivial Jacobson radical (only the zero element of the algebra is in the Jacobson radical). If the algebra is finite-dimensional this is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can be expressed as a Cartesian product of simple subalgebras.|$|R

50|$|Using Ecore as a {{foundational}} meta-model {{allows a}} modeler {{to take advantage}} of the entire EMF ecosystem and tooling - in as much as it's then reasonably easy to map application-level models back to Ecore. This isn't <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> best practice for applications to directly leverage Ecore as their metamodel; rather they might consider defining their own metamodels based on Ecore.|$|R
25|$|As a {{young man}} Winwaloe {{conceived}} a wish to visit Ireland to see the remains of Saint Patrick, who had just died. However, the saint appeared {{to him in a}} dream <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be better to remain in Brittany and found an abbey. So, with eleven of Budoc's other disciples, he set up a small monastery on the Île de Tibidy, {{at the mouth of the}} Faou. However it was so inhospitable that after three years, he miraculously opened a passage through the sea to found another abbey on the opposite bank of the Landévennec estuary.|$|E
25|$|Under this scheme, {{the foreign}} partner {{that makes the}} initial {{investment}} can repatriate the return on the investment (at a pre-agreed fixed rate) through goods and services produced by the project. While many foreign companies believe that this method is a mere financing instrument for Iran, it is more accurate <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a compromise formula for foreign investment in the short-run. In the medium to long-term, more appropriate laws and regulations will probably replace the buy-back scheme. In other words, once the constitutional concerns have been dealt with, the foreign partners of buy-back agreements can take over the projects that they are involved in, or they can enter into {{a joint venture with}} an Iranian partner.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the diverse}} range of artists I couldn’t say there was a {{particular}} flavour to the album. Perhaps the only continuity people will find on the album is the beats. As far as the content goes I’d have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> an album <b>that</b> Australian listeners can appreciate. You won’t find tracks on the album geared at trying to entice a US or European market.|$|R
50|$|Over a field, its dual line bundle is {{the line}} bundle {{associated}} to the hyperplane divisor H, whose global sections are the linear forms. Its Chern class is −H. This {{is an example of}} an anti-ample line bundle. Over C, this is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a negative line bundle, meaning that minus its Chern class is the de Rham class of the standard Kähler form.|$|R
25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 {{kilometers}} away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is safe <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place {{is considered one of the}} richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.|$|E
