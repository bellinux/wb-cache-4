The results of the third <b>topic</b> of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of the study to determine the Solar System's position and velocity in the galaxy. The final <b>topic</b> dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{evaluation}} of information retrieval systems involves {{the creation of}} potential user needs for which systems try to find relevant documents. The difficulty of these <b>topics</b> differs greatly and final scores for systems are typically based on the mean average. However, the <b>topics</b> which are relatively easy to solve, have a much larger impact on the final system ranking than hard <b>topics.</b> This paper presents a novel methodology to measure that effect. The results of a large evaluation experiment with 100 <b>topics</b> from the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) allow a split of the <b>topics</b> into four groups according to difficulty. The easy <b>topics</b> have a larger impact especially for multilingual retrieval. Nevertheless the internal test reliability as measured by Cronbach’s Alpha is higher for more difficult <b>topics.</b> We can show how alternative, robust measures like the geometric average distribute {{the effect of the}} <b>topics</b> more evenly. ...|$|R

Engineering educators also express concerns that they lack both preparation and ability to teach these <b>topics.</b> Software engineering educators have an even greater problem. More soft <b>topics</b> need {{to be included in}} a good software engineering program. Furthermore, software engineering instructors need to remain current with nonsocial best practices, which can leave little time to study techniques to incorporate soft <b>topics</b> into the curriculum.

We organize the soft <b>topics</b> necessary for a good software engineering program; present exercises to include them in software engineering courses so that students develop needed abilities and understand their importance; and describe effective ways to evaluate student performance...|$|R
