5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

I don’t know {{the game that}} well, so my mind drifted and I started writing.” Initially, Twain thought that [...] "From This Moment On" [...] would be perfect for singer Celine Dion; however, as Twain and Lange {{developed}} the song, they concluded that it would work best as a duet. While their first choice for the duet was Elton John, they chose country singer Bryan White. Twain later described White as [...] "the best male voice in country music. Beyond country music! He's an excellent singer. So he needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> record, because the song soars. It demands that. It demands dynamics." [...] White explained that, {{by the time he}} went to the recording, the song was mostly finalized, and described it as 'extremely challenging' vocally.|$|E

I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E

[...] The two artists performed the song on Saturday Night Live during December18,2010 in Lil Wayne's first major television appearance since his release from prison.

As worded by Mawuse Ziegbe from MTV, [...] " [...] spit the first verse with his signature unhinged energy, asserting {{his return to the}} live-television circuit. Em helmed the rest of the song, nimbly dropping his lyrics with abandon." [...] Eminem wore a black jacket and a cap, while Lil Wayne wore a white T-shirt. The performance also included other songs by each of the artists, such as [...] "6 Foot 7 Foot" [...] performed by Lil Wayne and [...] "Won't Back Down" [...] performed by Eminem.
