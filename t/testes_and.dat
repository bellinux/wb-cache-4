5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E

5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or <b>testes),</b> <b>and</b> build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{question}} remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures have internal <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> did not evolve external testes.

25|$|Parthenogenesis in turkeys {{appears to}} result from a {{conversion}} of haploid cells to diploid; most embryos produced in this way die early in development.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of cadmium (Cd), {{incorporated}} in radish bulbs, on malondialdehyde and glutathione levels and on superoxide dismutase activity in the liver, kidneys <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> of male rats. The control animals were given diet containing ordinary radish bulbs for 4, 8 and 12 weeks, while contaminated animals were given diet containing Cd-polluted rad-ish bulbs (1. 1 mg Cd/g of diet) for the same periods as in the controls. At each time point, rats were euthanized and the liver, kidneys <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> were removed. The results indicated that the body weight gain of contaminated rats was identical to that of the control rats. Cd concentrations in the liver, kidneys <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> increased significantly <b>and</b> gradually from the 4 th to 12 th week of treatment. Malo-ndialdehyde concentrations decreased significantly in the liver and increased significantly in the kidneys <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> after 12 weeks of treatment, while glutathione levels increased significantly in the liver, and decreased significantly in the kidneys <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> at the same time. No changes were observed in SOD activity in the liver, while in the kidneys <b>and</b> <b>testes,</b> this activity was increased after 12 weeks of treatment as compared with the control rats.

25|$|LH (luteinizing hormone) is {{a larger}} protein hormone {{secreted}} into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The main target cells of LH are the Leydig cells of <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> the theca cells of the ovaries. LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH, as LH levels increase about 25-fold {{with the onset of}} puberty, compared with the 2.5-fold increase of FSH.|$|E
25|$|DHT is {{synthesized}} irreversibly from testosterone by {{the enzyme}} 5α-reductase. This occurs in various tissues including the genitals (penis, scrotum, clitoris, labia majora), prostate gland, skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. Around 5 to 7% of testosterone undergoes 5α-reduction into DHT, and approximately 200 to 300μg of DHT is synthesized {{in the body}} per day. Most DHT is produced in peripheral tissues like the skin and liver, whereas most circulating DHT originates specifically from the liver. The <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> prostate gland contribute relatively little to concentrations of DHT in circulation.|$|E
25|$|During {{mammalian}} development, the gonads are {{at first}} capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. In humans, starting at about week 4, the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm {{adjacent to the}} developing kidneys. At about week 6, epithelial sex cords develop within the forming <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> incorporate the germ cells as they migrate into the gonads. In males, certain Y chromosome genes, particularly SRY, control development of the male phenotype, including conversion of the early bipotential gonad into testes. In males, the sex cords fully invade the developing gonads.|$|E

25|$|The testes of the non-boreotherian mammals, {{such as the}} monotremes, armadillos, sloths, and elephants, {{remain within}} the abdomen. There are also some {{marsupials}} with external <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> Boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. Cetaceans such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. As external testes would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{arguments}} for early orchiopexy is {{reducing the risk of}} testicular cancer. About 1 in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develops testicular cancer, roughly a 4 to 40 fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The risk is higher for intra-abdominal <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended testis of a man whose other testis was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those of other men.|$|E
25|$|The basal {{condition}} for mammals {{is to have}} internal testes.

40|$|Testes {{asymmetry}} theory {{predicts that}} males {{in good condition}} or mature age {{may be able to}} develop larger degrees of directional asymmetry than males in poor condition or younger age. In this study, we tested the testes asymmetry theory in the Bufo gargarizans. We found that B. gargarizans has a significant directional asymmetry in testes mass, with left testis being significantly larger than right testis. Male body condition was correlated with relative <b>testes</b> mass <b>and</b> absolute <b>testes</b> asymmetry, but not correlated with relative testes asymmetry. Therefore, we suggested that males in good body condition have the higher ability of sperm competition than males in poor body condition. Additionally, male age was correlated with absolute testes asymmetry, but not correlated with relative <b>testes</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> asymmetry, thus not supporting the hypothesis that males with a higher degree of directional asymmetry survive better. </p...|$|R
40|$|Male {{chickens}} {{belonging to}} three Italian purebreds – Ermellinata di Rovigo (ER), Robusta lionata (RL) and Robusta maculata (RM) – were studied. All {{the birds were}} reared under the same rearing conditions (from May until autumn). Chickens were reared under infra-red lamps from birth until 4 weeks of age with a 24 L: 0 D photoperiod. Then they were kept outdoor: the photoperiod changed according to the season (from 16 L: 8 D to 12 L: 12 D). At 138 and 168 days of age 20 birds/breed were weighed and then slaughtered. Testicular samples were collected, after evisceration, processed and embedded in paraffine wax. Sections were stained for morphological observations, observed with light microscope, and then classified according to the testis maturation stage. Ermellinata di Rovigo chickens showed the lowest (P< 0. 01) body weight and the highest (P< 0. 01) testes weight; testes maturity was higher (P< 0. 01) in ER than in RL, whereas RM was intermediate. For each genotype <b>testes</b> weight <b>and</b> <b>testes</b> maturity did not significantly differ with aging. Correlations between <b>testes</b> weight <b>and</b> body, comb, and wattles weight, according to the breed, were calculated at 168 days of age. For ER no significant correlation was found, whereas RL showed a significant (P< 0. 01) positive relationship between <b>testes</b> weight <b>and</b> body weight, and sexual secondary characters. Robusta maculata showed a significant correlation between <b>testes</b> weight <b>and</b> comb (P< 0. 01) and wattles weight (P< 0. 10).

25|$|Primary sex {{characteristics}} are those {{directly related to}} the sex organs. In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> scrotum, followed by growth of the penis. At the time that the penis develops, the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral gland also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation. Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{diagnostic}} dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile testis from a testis {{that will not}} descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended <b>testes</b> <b>and</b> {{do not need to}} be operated on. In normal males, as the cremaster muscle relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the scrotum. This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though there are various maneuvers used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} among testes mass, sperm size (as indicated by sperm tail length), and body mass of Old World {{rats and mice}} were investigated. A near isometric relationship between <b>testes</b> mass <b>and</b> body mass was found but not between body mass and sperm size. In a few lineages, testes mass deviated considerably from the regression line with relatively very small testes occurring in Bunomysfratrorum, Bandicota indica, and B. savilei of Asia, Aethomys ineptus of Africa, some Pseudomys, and all Notomys of Australia. By contrast, relatively large testes mass occurred in Apodemus, Berylmys, and Maxomys bartelsii of Asia, Pogonomys of New Guinea, and some Australasian Rattus, Melomys, and Mastaco-mys. Considerable variability in sperm size was also evident; some species that had rela-tively small testes also had relatively small spermatozoa.
