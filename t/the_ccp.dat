5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. <b>The</b> <b>CCP</b> also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> {{entered the}} First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the United Front {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the gender role espoused by <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E
5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary assessments of <b>the</b> <b>CCP,</b> citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed. Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>CCP</b> {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th Party Congress in 1997, Bo Xilai's family {{launched}} an unsuccessful campaign to secure his promotion {{to become a}} member of the Central Committee of <b>the</b> <b>CCP.</b> Although nepotism was generally frowned upon in China, Bo Yibo's ambitions for his son were well-known. Bo Yibo advanced the idea that revolutionary elders should 'nominate' their children to become high officials, and Bo Xilai was selected as his family's 'representative' over his older brother Bo Xicheng, ostensibly because of Xilai's superior academic credentials, which included attendance at the elite Peking University and a master's degree.|$|E
5|$|For {{the inauguration}} of <b>the</b> <b>CCP,</b> a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of {{a story about the}} {{prehistory}} of the Philippines, occurred on September 8, 1969. The United States of America's President Nixon was invited but instead Ronald Reagan, California's Governor, along with his wife, flew to the country using the Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities through getting them tickets to ride the Air Force one but she was denied of this luxury by President Nixon. Accounts have also mentioned that this trip of the then California's Governor and wife led to the closeness of the Reagans and Marcoses.|$|E

5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP case. He then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then solved the CPP case (a circle and two points) and <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a CCP case.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{had been}} an {{alternate}} member of the Central Committee since 1934, a full member since 1938, {{and a member of}} the Politburo since 1945, but it was not until he became the leader of the PLA and moved permanently to Beijing, in November 1953, that Peng was able to attend regular political meetings and became active in domestic politics. Peng had been loyal to Mao's leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference, and continued to support Mao for several years after moving to Beijing. Peng (like Lin Biao) was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang's effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953, but then opposed Gao in 1954, once Mao made his own opposition clear. Mao did not take any action against Peng (or Lin), but Peng's involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu's supporters. In 1955 Peng supported Mao's efforts to collectivize agriculture. Along with Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Lin Boqu, and Luo Ronghuan, Peng opposed Mao's attempt to liberalize China's culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign, but then supported Mao's efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> later that year.|$|E
40|$|Three {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) {{composite}} cross populations (CCPs) {{that had been}} maintained in repeated parallel populations under organic and conventional conditions from the F 5 to the F 10 were compared in a two-year replicated field trial under organic conditions. The populations were compared to each other, to a mixture of the parental varieties used to establish <b>the</b> <b>CCPs,</b> and to three winter wheat varieties currently popular in organic farming. Foot and foliar diseases, straw length, ear length, yield parameters, and baking quality parameters were assessed. The overall performance of <b>the</b> <b>CCPs</b> differed clearly from each other {{due to differences in}} their parental genetics and not because of their conventional or organic history. <b>The</b> <b>CCPs</b> with high yielding background (YCCPs) also yielded higher than <b>the</b> <b>CCPs</b> with a high baking quality background (QCCPs; in the absence of extreme winter stress). The QCCPs performed equally well in comparison to the reference varieties, which were also of high baking quality. Compared to the parental mixture <b>the</b> <b>CCPs</b> proved to be highly resilient, recovering much better from winter kill in winter 2011 / 12. Nevertheless, they were out yielded by the references in that year. No such differences were seen in 2013, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>CCPs</b> are comparable with modern cultivars in yielding ability under organic conditions. We conclude that—especially when focusing on traits that are not directly influenced by natural selection (e. g. quality traits) —the choice of parents to establish a CCP is crucial. In the case of the QCCPs the establishment of a reliable high-quality population worked very well and quality traits were successfully maintained over time. However, in the YCCPs lack of winter hardiness in the YCCP parents also became clearly visible under relevant winter conditions. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Xiang officially ran the {{headquarters}} of <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> after September 1928. There were several notable events under his direction. First, he sacked Cai's membership in the politburo for Cai's extremism towards the Sunzi Division of <b>the</b> <b>CCP,</b> which resulted in severe discontent at <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> center. Second, Xiang issued the Paper of the Central Committee of <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> to all CCP members, in which he emphasized that incorrect ideas in the revolution should be corrected, and that <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> should fight against dangers of bourgeois thoughts and actions. Third, Xiang proposed a series reforms of CCP organs, such as a merger of the labor union with the worker committee, of the propaganda department with the peasant committee, {{and the establishment of}} a military committee in the politburo. The boldest proposed reform involved <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> headquarters taking over the work of the Jiangsu Division of <b>the</b> <b>CCP,</b> which was very near Shanghai. But this last proposal was objected to by Zhou Enlai, who won support from other leaders. In the end, Xiang had to give up this proposal.|$|E
25|$|As a result, at the August 7, 1927 Conference of <b>the</b> <b>CCP,</b> <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> fired Chen Duxiu and {{selected}} Su and Xiang as interim {{members of the}} politburo of <b>the</b> <b>CCP.</b> Even so, the CCC's new leadership of Qu Qiubai and Li Weihan was still dominated by intellectuals, contrary to the Comintern's ideals.|$|E

25|$|Once Xiang {{was elected}} {{paramount}} leader of <b>the</b> <b>CCP,</b> it was inappropriate {{for him to}} stay in Moscow any longer.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{extremism}} and blindness of the Li Lisan line, <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> suffered great losses.

Xiang and Li still didn’t realize the clear and present danger and criticized these young, immature students heavily. Then the Comintern sent a telegram recalling Li to Moscow to account for his policies. Pavel Mif went to Shanghai as an envoy of the Comintern too. Under Mif’s direction, the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of <b>the</b> <b>CCP</b> was held, Li was replaced by Mif’s protégé Wang Ming, and his associates Bolsheviks took other important jobs.
