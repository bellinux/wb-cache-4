5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. <b>To</b> <b>safeguard</b> Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Strategic risk {{posed by}} German {{control of the}} Belgian and {{ultimately}} French coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war behaviour were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian neutrality. However, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own <b>to</b> <b>safeguard</b> Belgium's neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) {{in the event of}} war with Germany.|$|E
5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital.

However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the Australian military fought on the Western Front in France during World WarI, relatively few Australians fought in Europe during World WarII. The RAAF, including thousands of Australians posted to British units, made a significant contribution to the strategic bombing of Germany and efforts <b>to</b> <b>safeguard</b> Allied shipping in the Atlantic. The other services made smaller contributions, with two Army brigades being briefly based in Britain in late 1940 and several of the RAN's warships serving in the Atlantic.|$|E

Surya is aware of Bhardwaj's intentions. <b>To</b> <b>safeguard</b> himself, he traps Bhardwaj's daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts.

5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action.

5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897, under command of Admiral Otto von Diederichs. The two ships were sent <b>to</b> <b>safeguard</b> German interests in the Philippines after the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. There, Irenes presence caused tensions with the American squadron occupying the islands. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the century, and remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced to secondary roles—Irene was used as a submarine tender and Prinzess Wilhelm was hulked—and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During the First Balkan War, which {{broke out}} in the closing weeks of the Italo-Turkish War, Coatit and an {{international}} fleet was sent <b>to</b> <b>safeguard</b> foreign nationals in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople, which was threatened by a Bulgarian offensive. Neither ship saw action during World War I, though Agordat was involved in the occupation of Constantinople following the Ottoman defeat in November 1918. Both ships were reduced to secondary duties after the war, with Coatit being converted into a minelayer in 1919 and Agordat being reduced to a gunboat in 1921. Neither ship served for long in these new roles; Coatit was scrapped in 1920 and Agordat was sold to ship breakers in 1923.|$|E
