5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E
25|$|By chance, at a {{reception}} Asad met Pola, an American of Polish origin who {{was destined to}} become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He {{fell in love with}} her and when he came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-Pakistani national. He applied through the proper channels but the Governor-General rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, he sat down and wrote his extraordinary The Road to Mecca.|$|E
25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb to the {{darkness}} again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E

After spotting Kapoor at a party organised by Bombay Times, Karan decided to cast her immediately {{for the role of}} the glamorous diva, Poo. Kapoor stated that in her opinion, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was primarily Kajol's film, and that her own character was a supporting one. In order to prepare for her role, she worked hard on her dancing skills, as she did not want audiences <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not dance well.|$|E
500|$|At his home, Rusty discovers a small hatchet {{covered with}} Carolyn's blood and hair on it.

She expresses that she had left enough {{evidence}} for Rusty <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> committed the crime, but did not anticipate him being charged with the murder. In a voice-over, Rusty explains that Carolyn's murder has been written off as unsolved, since trying two people for the same crime is [...] "a practical impossibility" [...] and he cannot leave his son without a mother even if she could be tried. Rusty regrets {{that it was his}} own lust that caused his wife to commit murder.|$|E

While staying there, Shiva and his comrades, [...] Nandi and Veerbhadra, {{encounter}} a beautiful and mysterious woman, who has a look of penance on her face. They later come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is Princess Sati, the daughter of Daksha and is a Vikarma, an untouchable in this life due to sins committed in her previous births. Shiva tries to court her, but she rejects his advances. Ultimately Shiva wins her heart and they decide to get married, even though the Vikarma rule prohibits them from doing so. Enraged by the so-called obsolete law, Shiva declares himself as the Neelkanth and swears to dissolve the Vikarma law. Daksha allows Sati to get married to Shiva, amid much joy and happiness.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story {{collection}} to Vishal Bhardwaj. He {{was intrigued by}} a four-page story's title named [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, [...] "I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It {{reminded me of a}} very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} been much less forgiving; common critiques have derided the princess as a spoiled, shallow, bland and overly sexualized character. Common Sense Media criticized Jasmine for lacking an {{original}} predicament and premise, while Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson described the character as a [...] "liberated" [...] but [...] "stiff" [...] heroine. Janet Maslin of The New York Times panned Jasmine: [...] "the sloe-eyed Princess Jasmine... a nymph in harem pants, use words like 'fabulous' and 'amazing' to express unremarkable thoughts", concluding, [...] "Luckily, [...] surrounded by an overpowering array of secondary characters who make the film's sidelines much more interesting than its supposed center." [...] Time Out called the character disappointing, and TV Guide described her as [...] "bland". Film critic Roger Ebert cited Jasmine among the film's weaknesses, dismissing the relationship between her and Aladdin as [...] "pale and routine" [...] in comparison to Belle and the Beast's. Additionally, Ebert wrote that the characters [...] "look unformed, as if even the filmmakers didn't see them as real individuals." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine derided the character as [...] "another 'free-spirited' type in the Barbie-doll tradition, a faux feminist who wants everyone <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can do everything the boys can". Orange Coasts Henry A. Giroux dismissed Jasmine {{as little more than}} [...] "an object of 's immediate desire" [...] and [...] "stepping stone to social mobility." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{author of}} , gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} performance saying that [...] "defiance being a rock attitude, and one embraced by Madonna, she didn't hesitate in wanting her public <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> hasn't mellowed over the years", evident by her unsmiling facial expressions. Casper Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph felt that {{with the performance of}} the song, the Drowned World show [...] "picked up pace." [...] In a review in Los Angeles Times, critic Greg Kot said that the [...] "ballistic" [...] response of the audience to the performance of [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] and another song [...] "Candy Perfume Girl" [...] confirmed the crowd's satisfaction regarding the show. A similar review was given by Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani, who described the performance as a [...] "virulent and possessive dance routine", and felt it {{set the tone for the}} whole show. Alex Needham from NME compared the performance with those by The Royal Ballet, suggesting that if the group performed in rubber-fetish, they would be similar to Madonna's theatrics. Todd Ramlow from PopMatters criticized Madonna's vocals during the performance, saying that she sounded flat during the lower notes of the song. The electronic effects used in the song was received negatively by Ramlow, who felt that Madonna should have opted for the addition of backing vocalists. The performance of the song on August 26, 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, outside of Madonna's hometown of Detroit was recorded and released in the live video album, Drowned World Tour 2001 on November 13, 2001.|$|E

Wolfe has written, [...] "Willis, the {{erstwhile}} stand-up superstar of SF conventions - {{having her}} as your MC is like getting Billy Crystal back {{as host of}} the Oscars - {{and the author of}} some of the field's funniest stories, is a woman of considerably greater complexity and gravity than her personal popularity reflects, and for all her facility at screwball comedy knock-offs and snappy parody, <b>she</b> wants us <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> a writer of some gravity as well." ...|$|R
500|$|The video {{opens with}} two men {{watching}} a rush in the screening rooms of a Hollywood studio. On the screen, an actress played by Madonna sings and dances to [...] "Material Girl", dressed like Monroe from [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". One of the men, played by Carradine, is a director or a producer and is immensely rich. He {{falls in love with}} the actress and wants to express his passion for her. He tells his employee, played by Wuhl: [...] "She's [...] fantastic. She could become a star." [...] The employee answered: [...] "She could be. She could be great. She could be a major star." [...] The former then concludes by saying: [...] "She is a star, George." [...] Madonna is in a pink strapless gown and has her hair in blond locks ala Monroe. The background is a reconstruction of the Monroe video, complete with staircase, chandeliers and a number of tuxedo clad chorus boys. Madonna dances and sings the song, while she is showered with cash, expensive jewellery, furs and is carried by the men over the stairs. At one time, she alludes herself from the men, by dismissing them with her fan. As the producer tries to impress Madonna, he comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does not like material things, but rather prefers simple romance. He pretends to be penniless, and brings her hand-cut flowers while paying a poor man a large amount to borrow (or possibly buy) his dirty truck to take her on a date. His plan seems to work, because the final scene shows him and Madonna kissing in the truck in an intimate position.|$|E

And she {{lost a lot}} of weight so that if you looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. But to say that she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment" [...] Bradstreet {{writes a}} letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to {{describe}} her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer {{can be seen as}} a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. [...] "Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn." [...] She wants her husband <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. [...] "Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence." [...] One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of 2002, Nina {{released}} her debut album under Warner Music, entitled Heaven, alongside her first single of the same title. The album is inspired by contemporary R and pop music, and it was well received by critics, with The Philippine Star stating [...] "Heaven is quite a package. Production is sleek and Nina’s delivery, smooth [...] it is never heavy nor frenetic. It is instead used as a stable base for Nina’s sweet but definitely multi-octave singing voice. This is surely her strongest point and it is really a blessing <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can skillfully wield her vocals to conform to the demands of every song." [...] The lead single, [...] "Heaven", did not really become a commercial hit despite peaking inside the top ten of Philippine charts. In December 2002, [...] "2nd Floor" [...] was released as a radio-only single. Even though the song was not commercially released, it charted inside the top ten and won her the Best R Song award on the 16th Annual Awit Awards in 2003. [...] "Jealous" [...] was released as the second official single and it became Nina's first number one hit, topping various Philippine charts for three weeks. It also allowed her to grab the Best New Artist award on both Awit Awards and MTV Pilipinas Music Awards in 2003. The third commercial single is her acoustic version of Steve Perry's [...] "Foolish Heart", which became her second number one single as it charted even better than her previous releases. The song was a critical acclaim, being described by critics as [...] "proof of Nina's musicality." [...] "Loving You", a Ric Segreto original, became the last commercial single from Heaven. It did not top the local charts, but peaked inside the top five. In October 2003, the album was re-released when it reached the double platinum mark.|$|E
