International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether a refined assessment {{of exposure to}} bitumen fume among workers in the European asphalt industry within a nested case-control study resulted in a different interpretation pertaining to risk of lung cancer mortality compared with the cohort study. METHODS: Pearson correlation coefficients between refined and original estimates were calculated. Logistic regression and generalised additive models (penalised splines) were fitted to estimate ORs for exposure to bitumen fume using the refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates, respectively, while adjusting for potential confounding. RESULTS: 1555 subjects included in the nested case-control study had both refined and <b>original</b> estimates for <b>exposure</b> to bitumen fume. Exposure assessment in the nested case-control study (compared with the cohort phase) {{increased the number of}} subjects never-exposed to bitumen fume from 18 % to 32 %. From the 1282 subjects originally considered exposed in the cohort phase, 309 (24 %) became unexposed after the nested case-control exposure assessment. From the 273 subjects originally considered non-exposed in the cohort phase, 87 (32 %) became exposed in the nested case-control study. The majority (75 %) of subjects however did not change exposure status and changes were similar among cases and controls. Correlation coefficients between refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates were moderate overall (range 0. 42 - 0. 46), but varied considerably among countries. The ORs and exposure-response curves for exposure to bitumen fume were not meaningfully different between analyses that used refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates. Adjustment for tobacco smoking and exposure to coal tar did not change these patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that more detailed data collection and exposure assessment in the nested case-control study compared with the cohort study did change exposure status of many subjects, but did not alter results of the exposure-response analysis. Adjustment for tobacco smoking did not have a noticeable effect on risk estimates either...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{detailed}} study of time-dependent or viscous remanence (VRM), thermoremanence (TRM) and magnetic granulometry of soil breccia 14313, single-domain particles of iron 100 to 200 A in size are proposed as the major carriers of natural remanence (NRM) in this rock. The VRM of 14313 is unusually intense and exhibits a logarithmic time decrease of VRM which ceases fairly abruptly after a time about equal to the <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> to the field. The partial TRM spectrum reveals both a high-blocking-temperature fraction, scarcely affected by AF demagnetization to 1000 Oe, and an unusual concentration of blocking temperatures just above room temperature. The former fraction would contribute a very hard and stable component to any NRM of lunar origin, but the latter fraction, which accounts for the pronounced VRM of 14313 and undoubtedly has imparted a large viscous NRM component in the earth's field, is also surprisingly hard. A substantial portion (20 to 40 %) is not demagnetized by an 800 -Oe field...|$|R
