5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents.

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, {{hoped to be}} the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortlist}} of nominees {{is published}} in April {{and the winner}} of the award, along with the winners of the PFA's other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in London a few days later.

5|$|A {{supported}} {{lipid bilayer}} (SLB) {{as described above}} has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs.

50|$|High {{levels of}} many {{transcription}} factors and co-factors are seen at super-enhancers (e.g., CDK7, BRD4, and Mediator).This {{high concentration of}} transcription-regulating proteins suggests why their target genes tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>highly</b> expressed than other classes of genes. However, housekeeping genes tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>highly</b> expressed than super-enhancer—associated genes.|$|R

5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the document and that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted that the work seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E
5|$|In early 1987 Djajakusuma's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} heart disease, which led Djajakusuma to begin dieting and stop smoking. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> respected in Indonesian film circles, but was displeased {{with the condition}} of the country's film industry, which he considered {{to be on the verge}} of collapse. This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity.|$|E

5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, it tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E
5|$|Louisiana {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} law that would exempt fantasy sports from its anti-online gambling laws, but the bill was defeated as the result of lobbying by both the Louisiana Family Forum (which showed concerns that players could develop an addiction to daily fantasy games), and the Louisiana Video Gaming Association (which felt that DFS would cannibalize the legal video poker industry, and needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> regulated).|$|E
5|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback has {{not been}} {{identified}} as a threat to this species, but testing has found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> susceptible; in one study it exhibited the highest susceptibility of 49 Banksia species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{requiring}} all desired functionality to be {{built into}} the language's core, Python was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.|$|E
5|$|Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{invited the}} Yemenite scholar Abd al-Rahman ibn Hurayn al-Jabri {{to come to}} Omdurman and make a study of Mahdism. Al-Jabri wrote a book {{covering}} {{the history of the}} movement and its justification in the hadith, essentially designed to glorify the Mahdi and his son. Abd al-Rahman tried to publish the book in 1925–26, but the British confiscated the manuscript, which they considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> seditious. To avoid publicity, they did not prosecute al-Jabri but quietly deported him.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Taraki, albeit short-lived, was always marked by controversies. Taraki launched a land reform on 1 January 1979 which proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> unpopular and, {{along with his}} government's other reforms, led to a popular backlash which initiated the Afghan civil war. Despite repeated attempts throughout his reign, Taraki proved unable to persuade the Soviet Union to intervene {{in support of the}} restoration of civil order.|$|E

However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|Vector control {{refers to}} {{methods used to}} {{decrease}} malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common. Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} wrapped on Chalk in 1997, Moffat {{announced to}} the cast that he was marrying Vertue. When she eventually asked him for a sitcom, he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship. Coupling was first broadcast on BBC2 in 2000, with his wife producing for Hartswood Films. The series proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> successful, running until 2004 and producing four series and twenty-eight episodes, all written by Moffat. He also wrote the original, unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version, also titled Coupling, although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network. Moffat has blamed its failure on an unprecedented level of network interference.|$|E
