Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage <b>treatment.</b> <b>Waste</b> oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E

40|$|A {{cost-effectiveness}} of {{a specific}} <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technique is very important factor when making the decision {{to invest in a}} <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> facility. <b>Waste</b> <b>treatment</b> can bring economic benefit through the value of product: recycled materials, the compost, the generated electricity, or heat. However, the expected economic benefits depend on many factors: the investment costs and operating costs of the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> facility, revenues, the market price of the product obtained by <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> etc. The investment and operating costs and the revenue also depend on the amount of treated waste. This paper presents a mathematical model for evaluation of cost-effectiveness in the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technique with energy recovery depending on the amount of waste, i. e. evaluation the minimum amount of waste to be treated for a cost-effective <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technique with energy recovery. To develop the mathematical model, a socio-economic analysis was used. The model is applied to calculate the lower limit of cost-effectiveness in the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> techniques with energy recovery: incineration and anaerobic digestion, in the city of Nis, Serbia, as a case study. The obtained results show that the amount of waste currently generated in the city of Nis is not sufficient for the cost-effective incineration treatment, but with the currently available amount of waste, anaerobic digestion is the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> that can be operated without losses in the city of Nis...|$|R

This work studies the possibility of incorporating water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>waste</b> into soil-cement bricks for civil construction. A sample of this waste material was analyzed for chemical composition, X-ray diffraction, particle size, plasticity, and organic matter. Mixtures of soil-cement containing up to 5 wt. % of waste as a partial substitute of soil were pressed and cured for 28 days.
