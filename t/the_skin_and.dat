5|$|In {{addition}} to normal-length spines, {{members of the}} subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called glochids, that are barbed along their length and easily shed. These enter <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> are difficult to remove, causing long-lasting irritation.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> mucosal linings {{of the nose}} and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays {{eggs in the}} bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> cricothyroid membrane {{to establish a}} patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed on metallic sandwich structures as an armor for aeronautical applications. Several combinations of AA 5086 -H 111 aluminium <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> aluminium honeycomb core have been studied, considering medium-velocity and highenergy impacts. The aim is to establish links between the sandwich performances and the material and geometrical parameters. An elasto-plastic, strain-rate dependent behavior has been implemented to represent <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> core. The sandwich model has been calibrated and validated from the experimental data. Dynamic effects, as well as strong couplings between <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> core {{appear to have a}} significant effect on the target performance...|$|R
5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of abdominal pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow discoloration of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> the whites of the eyes).|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and,</b> in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E

25|$|During {{this last}} cold {{phase of the}} Pleistocene, the Bogotá savanna became {{populated}} by the first humans, as evidenced by findings in El Abra (12,500 BP), Tibitó (11,740 BP) and Tequendama (11,000 BP). These hunter-gatherers lived in rock shelters, collected food, and hunted animals mainly comprising white-tailed deer, little red brocket and guinea pigs. White-tailed deer was the largest species—males: , females: —hunted by the people, {{not only for the}} meat, but also to use <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> bones. <b>The</b> hunter-gatherers of these early lithic Abriense and Tequendamiense cultures used edge-trimmed flakes to process <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> meat.|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E

5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as {{basal cell}} carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators {{can be used to}} ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz's sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale is removed), Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma to <b>the</b> <b>skin),</b> <b>and</b> itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E

5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales.

The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> hair of mammals.
