2500|$|With GM as {{its primary}} example, the film {{documents}} that car makers engaged in {{both positive and}} negative marketing of the electric car as its intentions <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and California legislation changed. [...] In earlier days, GM ran Super Bowl commercials produced by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for the EV1. In later days it ran [...] "award winning" [...] doomsday-style advertising featuring the EV1 and ran customer surveys which emphasized drawbacks to electronic vehicle technology which were not actually present in the EV1. [...] (As a side note, CARB officials were quoted claiming that they removed their zero emission vehicle quotas in part because they gave weight to such surveys purportedly showing no demand existing for the EV1s.) Other charges raised on GM included sabotaging their own product program, failing to produce cars to meet existing demand, and refusing to sell cars directly (it only leased them).|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 1981, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker {{was shot}} and killed along a stretch of highway a few miles north of Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker's body, {{discovered}} by a passer-by, was lying beside his patrol car. He {{had been shot in the}} head. Around the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling on the same road away from where Rucker's body had been found. [...] Carrisalez and his partner turned on the patrol car's flashing red lights and pursued the vehicle, which pulled over. Carrisalez took a flashlight and walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The driver of the vehicle opened his door and exchanged words with Carrisalez before firing at least one shot at Carrisalez' chest. He died nine days later. Leonel Torres Herrera was arrested a few days later and was charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker.|$|E

60|$|Down {{the slopes}} Sherikov's guards raced, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stalled <b>cars.</b> Clouds of heat rose up and boiled across the plain as <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> fired {{up at the}} running men. A robot gun dropped like a slug onto the plain and screamed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> firing as it came.|$|R

50|$|Accelerometers {{measure the}} linear {{acceleration}} of the moving vehicle in the sensor or body frame, but in directions {{that can only be}} measured relative to the moving system (since the accelerometers are fixed to the system and rotate with the system, but are not aware of their own orientation). This {{can be thought of as}} the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel themselves pressed back into their seat as the vehicle accelerates forward or pulled forward as it slows down; and feel themselves pressed down into their seat as the vehicle accelerates up a hill or rise up out of their seat as <b>the</b> <b>car</b> passes over <b>the</b> crest of a hill and begins to descend. Based on this information alone, they know how the vehicle is accelerating relative to itself, that is, whether it is accelerating forward, backward, left, right, up (<b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> ceiling), or down (<b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> floor) measured relative to <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> but not <b>the</b> direction relative to the Earth, since they did not know what direction <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was facing relative to the Earth when they felt the accelerations.|$|R

60|$|They {{walked on}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Valencia and Headley {{following}} them: ere {{they arrived at}} the place where they were to meet it, it was quite dark: but what was more important, the car was not there.|$|E
50|$|The protagonist is {{last seen}} {{walking into a}} {{driveway}} when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene {{at the start of}} the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> handle, but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.|$|R
60|$|On {{leaving the}} little humanitarian, Felix drifted back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> court. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> were gone, <b>the</b> groups dispersed; alone, {{leaning on his}} stick, the old, dark-whiskered man stood like a jackdaw with a broken wing. Yearning, at that moment, for human intercourse, Felix went up to him.|$|R
60|$|The brawny Irishman wheeled {{and strode}} back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front <b>car</b> of <b>the</b> train. All the crowd,--to a man, muttering and gaping, {{followed}} him. Casey {{climbed up on}} the gravel-car.|$|R
6000|$|There was a silence. Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," [...] {{said the}} sentry, {{and they started}} to walk <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> line, the lawyer and the Colonel together. Virginia put her hand through the Captain's arm. In the {{darkness}} he laid his big one over it.|$|E
6000|$|Grace's {{expression}} changed, and I thanked Alice in {{my heart}} for what I believe few women would have done. Then there was a shriek of the whistle, and a bustle about the train; and as Grace moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> she said softly in passing: ...|$|E
60|$|Leeson {{stood waiting}} with Forster, and Jordan was already running <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> but Jimmy's lips set tight {{when he saw}} Eleanor with Mrs. Forster. In {{a moment or two}} Jordan handed Anthea down, and then stood aside as Eleanor came impulsively forward. To her brother's astonishment, she laid her hand on Anthea's {{shoulder}} and kissed her on each cheek.|$|E

2500|$|This effort moved AMC {{once again}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> muscle <b>car</b> market segment; however the Rebel {{was criticized for}} its antiquated torque tube {{suspension}} system. The Rebel also suffered from Rambler's [...] "economy" [...] reputation, but the Rebel model offered the recipe common to most of early muscle <b>cars</b> including <b>the</b> biggest-available engine, bucket seats, and special trim, but the Rebel {{did not have a}} non-functional hood scoop.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we made an {{analysis}} of the loyalty in the auto market. We selected a sample from the residents of Craiova and asked them about their intentions concerning satisfaction, repurchase and recommendation regarding their cars. We used as auto market as the base of our study, since <b>the</b> <b>car</b> industry is very attractive to customers. We documented some correlation among the three dimensions of the loyalty. At the applicative level we found out that <b>the</b> loyalty <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> German <b>cars</b> is much higher than the loyalty for <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> from other countries. Further studies are needed to investigate the complex dimensions of the loyalty in-depth...|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he grabbed a}} {{stretcher}} and ran forward, Maurie following at his heels. Uncle John saw the smoke swallow them up, saw Beth and Maud each busy with lint, plasters and bandages, saw Patsy supporting a tall, grizzled warrior who came limping <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Then he turned and saw Doctor Gys, crouching low against the protecting sand, his disfigured face working convulsively and every limb trembling as with an ague.|$|E
60|$|Prescott {{heard it}} on the station {{platform}} and with strong misgivings braced himself for his task. A bright light was speeding down the track, blending with that flung out by a freight locomotive crossing the switches. Then amid the clangor of the bell the long cars rolled in and he saw a man standing on the platform of one. There was {{no doubt that he}} was an Englishman and Prescott hurried <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
60|$|The sun had disappeared, {{and a fine}} {{rain was}} falling when at last the long cars came clanking into the station amid the doleful tolling of the {{locomotive}} bell. Alison, stepping down from the platform, noticed {{a man in a}} long fur coat and a wide soft hat running <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Then there was a cry and an outbreak of strained laughter, and she saw him lift her companion down and hold her unabashed in his arms. After that Milly seized her by the shoulder.|$|E

60|$|Once in {{the street}} Barney turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> south. <b>Cars</b> were passing {{up and down in}} both directions, usually at high speed. Their numbers {{protected}} the fugitive. Momentarily he expected to be halted; but he passed out of the village without mishap and reached a country road which, except for a lane down its center along which automobiles were moving, was blocked with troops marching southward. Through this soldier-walled lane Barney drove for half an hour.|$|R
50|$|Pueo are {{strongly}} affected by light pollution. They are often killed in vehicular accidents {{in which they}} dive <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> headlights of <b>cars,</b> possibly {{in an attempt to}} hunt.

60|$|Burton asked {{a number}} of {{questions}} in an effort to fix the identity of some of the gang, warned Jeb to telephone him at Jonas Prim's if he saw anything further of the strangers, and then retraced his steps <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Not once had Jeb mentioned the youth who had purchased supplies from him that morning, and the reason was that Jeb had not considered the young man of sufficient importance, having cataloged him mentally as an unusually early specimen of the summer camper with which he was more or less familiar.|$|E
60|$|He hurried out, and a {{few minutes}} later Edgar crossed the street and strolled along the low wooden platform, upon which a smart constable was waiting. A long trail of smoke, drawing rapidly nearer, {{streaked}} the gray and ochre of the level plain, and presently the big engine and dusty cars rolled into the station amid the hoarse tolling of the bell. As they ran slowly past him, Edgar saw a police trooper leaning out from a vestibule, and when the train stopped the constable on the platform hurried <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> A hum of excited voices broke out and Edgar had some difficulty in pushing through the growing crowd to reach the steps. A constable, who had hard work to keep the others back, let him pass, and he found Flett standing on the platform above, looking rather jaded, with a pistol loose in his holster.|$|E

Inside, Cole tearfully apologizes to Ruth for being a bad father. Crying, she forgives and embraces him. Joseph then tells Cole that Jesus will only forgive him if he lets the hostages go. Cole whispers {{that he is going}} to kill them all, but is doing it all for him. Joseph tells him he loves him, then stabs him in the gut with a knife, and he falls to the floor, only able to gasp [...] "Behold your legacy" [...] before he dies. Ruth, shocked, collapses sobbing over her father's corpse.|$|R
5000|$|Kazuya's machine, which {{transforms}} from tranzor mode, a giant truck, to robot mode. It utilizes {{a system}} that mimics the pilot's movements, which especially helps Kazuya in combat due to his training in Karate. Before battle, Daimos in tranzor mode is launched from inside a cave while Kazuya drives his Tryper 75S car (called [...] "Rover 75S" [...] in <b>the</b> Filipino dub) <b>toward</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> is launched into the tranzor through its rear doors before the cockpit detaches and is placed forward into the cab. After running off a cliff at top speed, the Tranzor begins its transformation into Daimos (called “Dynamo” in Starbirds).|$|R
5000|$|According to his driving {{record with}} the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, Bauer has {{had at least}} two accidents, four tickets, and one {{suspended}} license for failure to pay a ticket. On May 6, 2003, Bauer was stopped on Assembly Street in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, for running two red lights and speeding up to 60 mph in a 35-mph zone. The officer drew his gun after Bauer got out of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and began heading <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> officer's <b>car</b> in an [...] "aggressive manner." [...] He was issued a ticket for reckless driving. On December 26, 2005, Bauer got a warning for speeding (77 mph in a 65 mph zone) in Laurens County, South Carolina. On February 25, 2006, Bauer was pulled over for speeding over 100 mph in Chester County, South Carolina in a state-issued car, but {{he was allowed to}} proceed without a ticket or warning.|$|R

50|$|The cars {{maneuver}} {{a slight}} inclined turn, where they pass by the Knit-Witt, an original 1964 gag; {{a set of}} three wall-mounted busts; and a witch, who lunges <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The car makes yet another rapid descent; this one leads through a graveyard-themed room. The cars pass {{through a number of}} hinged door-like graves, which are knocked aside as the vessel speeds downhill. Hanging above is a ghoul, while a demonic looking entity rises from behind a gravestone. The car finally begins an ascent upward. As the car climbs up the incline, a bat flies <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> from overhead. After reaching the top of the incline and crashing through a set of doors, the car passes a coffin bathed in a bright red light. The car makes a sharp left turn and heads up a steeper incline. This one, which includes another crooked grade, is located inside another crooked hallway. Nearing the peak, one of the overhead beams cracks. The cars enter a set of doors and level out into darkness.|$|E
50|$|The car {{enters a}} set of double doors (sometimes known as light barriers) and enters the first room. Two of Tracy's gags occupy the space: A large rat perched on a tree stump, and a {{staircase}} covered with spiders whose bodies resemble skulls. The rat lunges forward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> while the spiders spin back-and-forth on the stairs. The room is used frequently to house cars which have broken down. The entrance to the main workshop is also located in the room.|$|E
40|$|This film, part of {{series on}} the various {{activities}} of the Post Office, starts with a scene of a large railroad mail car on a siding. A horse-drawn, four-wheeled vehicle with a sign "U.

5000|$|A light {{turns on}} {{revealing}} {{a set of}} barrels which fall <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> riders. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> then heads into a room where the tipping grade is the gag's main aspect. The room, which {{is known as the}} [...] "Wave Room", is decked out with neon wave patterns across the walls. The grade pushes <b>the</b> <b>car</b> back-and-forth as though it were out at sea. Another set of doors leads to a room which is occupied by a Frankenstein who lunges at the vessel, and a Vampire lit by strobe lights. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> then heads out onto the ride's second story balcony. This portion was a major addition in 1989's expansion. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> leave <b>the</b> interior scenes and emerge into the light of day. The riders get a better view of Tracy's detailed facade while passers-by and riders' families and friends can see them mid-ride. The bat which adorns the facade is another 1964 original. It's taken down during the winter and placed inside to avoid the grueling ocean weather, which helps ensure its survival. The bat received a complete facelift for the 2010 season.|$|R
60|$|When {{they had}} alighted, Prescott {{asked for the}} checks and moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> baggage <b>car.</b> While he waited, {{watching}} the trunks being flung out, Ellice passed him talking to a smartly dressed man. This struck Prescott as curious, but he knew the man as a traveling salesman for an American cream-separator, and as he must have called at Jernyngham's homestead on his round and was no doubt leaving by the train, {{there was no reason}} why Ellice should not speak to him. He thought no more of the matter and proceeded to carry several trunks and valises across the platform to his wagon, while his new friends watched him with some surprise. It was a novel experience in their walk of life to see their host carrying their baggage, and when Prescott lifted the heaviest trunk Colston hurried forward to protest.|$|R
