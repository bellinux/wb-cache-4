Pasture tolerance and efficacy of three herbicides used against giant buttercup (Ranunculus acris subsp. acris L.). New Zealand Plant Protection. 64 : 86 - 92. Retrieved from [URL] buttercup (Ranunculus acris L.) is a serious weed of dairy pastures throughout New Zealand causing substantial economic losses from lost pasture productivity. It has developed resistance to the phenoxy herbicides (MCPA and MCPB) at many sites around New Zealand, particularly in Golden Bay. Since the discovery of resistance in the 1980 s, two newer herbicides from a different mode-of-action group (acetolactate synthase inhibitor, ALS), flumetsulam and <b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> have been used widely, which appeared to overcome the resistance problem. A survey of farmers in Golden Bay indicated that most have herbicide control programmes for giant buttercup based around flumetsulam but some have reported poor control with this herbicide, particularly {{after several years of}} use. The research in this thesis was undertaken to determine whether {{this may be due to}} evolved resistance. Seedling progeny from 15 populations of giant buttercup, with known spraying history, were sprayed with a range of doses of flumetsulam, <b>thifensulfuron-methyl</b> and MCPA (Experiment 1) to test for differences in susceptibility. The experiment revealed a large difference in susceptibility between the populations (83 - 100 % and 58 - 100 % mortality at the recommended rate and 2. 2 times that rate of flumetsulam applied, respectively). The population with the highest past exposure to flumetsulam showed the lowest mortality and 25 % of plants in this population survived a treatment with 5 times the recommended rate. There was a significant declining trend between percent mortality and historical exposure of these populations to flumetsulam. However, most populations with low previous exposure had no or few resistant individuals and only a few populations with high previous exposure had several resistant individuals present, as indicated by their survival above recommended rates. Calculated LD 50 values did not correlate well to the survival data or to historical exposure to flumetsulam, because the herbicide rates chosen in this experiment were too high. Measurements of the biomass of giant buttercup, obtained several times after spraying in Experiment 1, showed some evidence of cross resistance to <b>thifensulfuron-methyl</b> but not to MCPA. Biomass yields 3 months after treatment were 1, 2 and 22 % of untreated for the recommended rates of flumetsulam, MCPA and thifensulfuron respectively, indicating that flumetsulam and MCPA were equally effective, but that <b>thifensulfuron-methyl</b> was less effective. In Experiment 2, plants from the most resistant and susceptible populations in Experiment 1, were grown from spare seeds and treated with a wider range of doses (including lower doses) of flumetsulam than in Experiment 1. The LD 50 values for the two populations in this second experiment differed 5. 3 -fold and this difference was highly significant. Twenty-nine percent of plants from the population with high past exposure survived treatment with 25 times the recommended rate of flumetsulam compared to 0 % from the population with no past exposure. In a third experiment the same three herbicides and rates were compared for their damage to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens) sown either in pots (Exp. 3 a), or transplanted from the field (Exp. 3 b). The total clover yield harvested over 5 months from newly-sown pasture was 80, 59 and 4 % that of the untreated control for flumetsulam, <b>thifensulfuron-methyl</b> and MCPA applied at recommended rates, and 95, 40 and 30 % respectively for transplanted swards. The total yield of grass was not reduced by any of the herbicides. Overall flumetsulam was the least pasture-damaging herbicide, but rates could not be increased above recommended rates in order to deal with resistance because pasture damage occurred. The experiments in this study indicate that resistance to flumetsulam may be evolving in giant buttercup in dairy pastures in Golden Bay, but more research is needed in field trials to confirm this. Furthermore, the results indicate that some populations may no longer be resistant to MCPA, but this also needs further study to confirm. Currently-available herbicides may not provide adequate control of giant buttercup in the future if existing management practices continue...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{relies heavily}} {{on the use of}} chemicals for pest control to increase crop yields. However, improper handling and disposal of pesticides and pesticide waste may compromise surface water and groundwater quality. In farmyards, point-source contamination includes spills occurring during filling operations, sprayer rinsate, leaks, internal and external sprayer cleaning, and spray leftovers, and accounts for 40 to 90 % of surface water and groundwater contamination by pesticides. Over the years, various biopurification systems have been developed to minimize the risk of point-source contamination by pesticides. One such system is the biobed. It consists of an active matrix (straw, peat or compost, and topsoil) in a ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 (v/v/v) in a pit. The effectiveness of the biobed mix is based on its ability to adsorb pesticides into its active matrix or stimulate their rapid biodegradation by offering suitable biological and physicochemical conditions for optimum microbial activity. The objective of this project was to study the efficiency of biobeds under Saskatchewan climatic conditions. Two laboratory studies and one field study were conducted in Saskatoon, SK. In the first laboratory study, the degradation of 2, 4 -D dimethylamine salt (2, 4 -D DMA) in single and multiple additions to the biobed mix and topsoil was investigated at 20 and 15 oC, respectively. In both studies, net CO 2 evolution was correlated with 2, 4 -D degradation. Degradation of 2, 4 -D was more rapid in the biobed mix, with more than 99. 9 % degradation in 10 d, compared to topsoil with only 35 % degradation in 28 d of incubation at 20 oC. In the multiple additions experiment, more than 99. 9 and 70 % of the applied amount of 2, 4 -D DMA was degraded in the biobed mix and topsoil, respectively, within 60 d of incubation at 15 oC. A mass balance showed that 93 and 51 % of the C added as 2, 4 -D dimethylamine salt was mineralized within 60 d of incubation at 15 oC in the biobed mix and topsoil, respectively. These results suggest that net CO 2 could be used as an indicator of 2, 4 -D DMA degradation in the biobed mix and topsoil used. A second laboratory experiment examined the degradation of seven pesticides at three temperatures (5, 13, and 20 oC). Pesticide degradation was more rapid at 20 oC compared to 13 and 5 oC. A significant interaction (sampling time x temperature) was observed in the degradation of <b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> 2, 4 -D DMA, pyrasulfotole, and bromoxynil. For metsulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl, and thiencarbazone-methyl, degradation was a function of sampling time and temperature with no interaction. After 35 d of incubation at 20 oC, 38, 94, 99, 77, 77, and 99 % of applied amounts of metsulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl, <b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> thiencarbazone-methyl, pyrasulfotole, and bromoxynil, respectively, were degraded while more than 99 % of the applied amount of 2, 4 -D DMA was degraded within 7 d. The results suggest that high pesticide degradation could be anticipated during warm conditions (summer) compared to fall or spring. A field study examined the degradation of six pesticides in two designs of biobed (the traditional below-ground biobed and a newly designed above-ground biobed) during two growing seasons. The above-ground biobed reached peak temperatures faster than the traditional below-ground biobed and was more efficient in water management. The above-ground biobed was more vulnerable to pesticide leaching out of the bottom compared to the below-ground biobed. The most leached pesticide was metsulfuron-methyl, with 4 and less than 0. 01 % of the applied amount leaching out of the bottom of the above-ground biobed and below-ground biobed, respectively. More than 99 % of the applied amounts of tribenuron-methyl, <b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> thiencarbazone-methyl, pyrasulfotole, and 2, 4 -D DMA were either retained by the biobed matrix or degraded within 2 growing seasons in both biobeds. This research shows that biobeds are capable of degrading herbicides from different chemical classes and could be used to reduce surface water and groundwater contamination arising from point sources in Saskatchewan in particular and the prairies in general. However, consideration in their design should include leaching potential, water management, early-season biobed temperature and they must be closed...|$|E

Compounds were measured in food, water and muscle tissue using multi-residues methods. Kinetics, biomagnification factors (BMFs) and half-lives (t 1 / 2) were estimated and they did not show a large difference between the species. Muscular BMFs ranged from 2 x 10 (- 6) (mesosulfuron-methyl in perch) to 1 x 10 (- 3) (isoproturon and napropamid in perch) and t 1 / 2 ranged from 0. 8 (mesosulfuronmethyl in perch) to 40. 3 d (napropamid in carp). BMFs were also modeled as a function of K-ow value. All BMF values were explained by the model, except for diflufenican which had a BMF lower than that expected by our modeling work, probably due to an efficient metabolism.

Growers from Nebraska reported failure to control common waterhemp following sequential applications of glyphosate in glyphosate-tolerant corn and soybean, which led to moderate to severe yield loss; justifying the need to confirm resistance and study the biology and management of common waterhemp. The objectives of this research were: 1) to confirm the presence of glyphosate-resistant (GR) common waterhemp biotypes in Nebraska and to evaluate their sensitivity to herbicides belonging to alternative sites-of-action; 2) to evaluate the response of common waterhemp to water stress; 3) to quantify pollen-mediated gene flow from GR common waterhemp under field conditions; and 4) to evaluate different herbicide programs for season-long control of glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp in glyphosate-tolerant soybean. Greenhouse dose-response studies conducted to evaluate the response of suspected GR common waterhemp biotypes collected from seven eastern Nebraska counties (Antelope, Dodge, Fillmore, Lancaster, Pawnee, Seward, and Washington) revealed that the biotypes were 3 - to 39 -fold resistant to glyphosate.

Cloransulam-methyl, linuron, metribuzin, flumetsulam, and imazethapyr applied PRE provided up to 6, 24, 14, 8, and 0 % control, respectively at 8 weeks after emergence (WAE), while acifluorfen, fomesafen, bentazon, <b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> cloransulam-methyl, imazethapyr, and imazethapyr plus bentazon applied POST provided 2, 2, 5, 34, 6, 4, and 12 % control, respectively at 8 weeks after application (WAA). Generally, with the aforementioned herbicides, soybean yield was equivalent to the weedy control and soybean grain contamination with adzuki bean seed was consistently above the 1 % maximum threshold. Chlorimuron-ethyl and glyphosate applied POST provided up to 84 and 94 % visual control at 8 WAA, respectively, decreased adzuki bean density, biomass, and seed production, and generally decreased soybean contamination with adzuki bean below the 1 % threshold. The only herbicides evaluated in this study that controlled volunteer adzuki bean in soybean were chlorimuron-ethyl (9 g ai. ha- 1 ) and glyphosate (900 g ai. ha- 1 ) applied POST. All the other PRE and POST herbicides evaluated did not provide adequate control of volunteer adzuki bean in soybean...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResidues of {{pesticides}} in fish farming productions from barrage ponds are seldom studied {{in spite of}} increasing health questionings and environmental concerns. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish the pesticide contamination profiles of sediments and edible fish from five ponds in Northeastern France. Multi-residues method and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis were used to quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, clomazone, diflufenican, dimethachlor, fluroxypyr, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and <b>thifensulfuron-methyl).</b> Ten sediments and 143 muscles samples were analysed, corresponding to two successive fishing campaigns (first fishing date and second fishing date (P 2), about 1 year later) on five sites (noted C- 0, C- 25, C- 45, C- 75 and C- 85 to express the increasing gradient of crop area). Isoproturon was present in all sediments samples (1. 8 - 56. 4 mu g/kg dry weight). During P 2 period, carbendazim was quantified in the fish of site C- 0 (0. 09 +/- 0. 02, 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 17 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg wet weight (ww) for roach, carp and perch, respectively). Metazachlor was only quantified in perch of the site C- 25 (0. 13 +/- 0. 02 mu g/kg ww). Concentrations of isoproturon were similar for the sites C- 45 and C- 75 with 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 75 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg ww for carp and perch, respectively. Contamination of fish reflected generally concentrations in surroundings. Isoproturon was the most concentrated and its main source was water for perch while carp was exposed through both water and sediments, highlighting their life strategies in pond...|$|E
40|$|Poa trivialis is a {{perennial}} grass weed {{commonly found in}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) racetrack swards throughout New Zealand. Its presence is undesirable as it does not tolerate high wear and is susceptible to dying out over the summer. Two pot trials at Massey University and one field trial carried out at the Awapuni racecourse were conducted during winter and spring 1995 to test the relative susceptibility of Poa trivialis and perennial ryegrass {{to a wide range}} of herbicides. A bioassay was also conducted to determine whether herbicide residues from the field trial could affect the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown soon after treatment. Results showed that none of the chemicals at their chosen respective rates could completely remove Poa trivialis from a racetrack sward in the spring without some damage being caused to perennial ryegrass. Propyzamide and fenoxaprop at rates of 0. 2 and 0. 15 kg/ha respectively showed the most potential of the chemicals, severely damaging Poa trivialis (causing 50 to 75 % reductions) with no adverse effect on perennial ryegrass 8 weeks after spraying. Propyzamide can also provide some control of Poa annua. Fenoxaprop was not improved by increasing the application rate or adding an oil. The performance of fenoxaprop was substantially reduced when applied with either MCPA or a picloram/triclopyr mix. Dalapon and asulam showed good potential to control Poa trivialis but at the high rates tested caused variable or harmful effects to perennial ryegrass. Ethofumesate and chlorpropham applied at rates of 2. 0 and 2. 5 kg/ha respectively gave inadequate control of Poa trivialis. None of the above herbicides, when used in the field trial resulted in residues which reduced the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown 3 weeks after spraying. Herbicides tested in the pot trials which showed poor control of Poa trivialis were atrazine, dicamba, isoproturon/diflufenican, linuron, mecoprop, methabenzthiazuron, metsulfuron, pendimethalin, prometryne, <b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> triclopyr, and trinexapac-ethyl. Diuron applied at 2. 6 kg/ha provided good control of Poa trivialis but caused significant damage to perennial ryegrass. It is concluded that an integrated management approach that incorporates both cultural and chemical techniques will be required to control Poa trivialis on New Zealand racetracks. Future trial work should be carried out on propyzamide applied at rates of 0. 2 - 0. 3 kg/ha in autumn to establish the most appropriate time of year to apply this herbicide...|$|E
40|$|Prairie {{wetlands}} {{are affected}} by agricultural activities, in particular herbicide contamination of wetland ecosystems. The environmental fate of herbicides in wetlands is determined by their persistence and transport. Currently, {{little is known about}} the persistence of commonly used herbicides in wetland water and sediment. The objective of this dissertation was to determine the importance of wetland sediments in influencing the fate of commonly used herbicides in prairie wetlands. Sediment sorption is an important dissipation pathway for herbicides. The effects of land use on physicochemical properties of wetland sediment, and the associations between these properties and herbicide sorption characteristics for four herbicides (trifluralin, atrazine, 2, 4 -D and glyphosate), were examined for 17 wetlands. The sorption of herbicides in sediment increased in the order of 2, 4 -D < atrazine < glyphosate < trifluralin. Overall, sediments from wetlands that were recently cultivated had lower total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable cation (EXCAT), cation excheageable capacity (CEC), and sorption coefficient (Kd) values (2, 4 -D, trifluralin, and atrazine) than sediments from semi-permanent and riparian ephemeral wetlands. Although TOC content was correlated to the sorption of 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and atrazine, riparian wetland sediments despite having a lower TOC content than semi-permanent wetland sediments, had the highest herbicide sorption capacity for 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and atrazine. To further examine the link between land use and herbicide sorption by sediment, a multi-residue analytical method was developed to quantify seven sulfonylurea herbicides commonly used in crop production (<b>thifensulfuron-methyl,</b> tribenuron-methyl, ethametsulfuron-methyl, metsulfuron-methyl, rimsulfuron, nicosulfuron and sulfosulfuron) in sediment from 17 wetlands. Sediment was extracted with deionized water using pressurized liquid extraction and the resultant extracts were cleaned-up using Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges. Quantification and confirmation were performed using liquid chromatography interfaced with positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and multiple reaction monitoring. Calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 994 and limits of quantification ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 0 µg kg- 1. Ethametsulfuron-methyl, sulfosulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl, the three most environmentally persistent of the seven sulfonylurea herbicides monitored in this study, were most frequently detected in wetland sediment. The concentrations of sulfonylurea herbicides were higher in sediments from the semi-permanent wetland, which received surface runoff from a larger catchment. To assess the relationship between herbicide dissipation and sorption to sediment, seven commonly used herbicides (glyphosate, dicamba, bromoxynil, 2, 4 -D, MCPA, mecoprop-P and dichlorprop) were applied to one half of an ephemeral (E) and a semi-permanent (SP) prairie wetland to mimic a direct overspray event, a worst-case scenario for wetland contamination. Water and sediment samples collected over a 77 -d study period (early June to late August) were analyzed for herbicide concentration; aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the degradation product of glyphosate, was also monitored. Glyphosate dissipated rapidly in the water column of each wetland with DT 50 values of 3. 7 d for wetland E and 6. 9 d for wetland SP. The mass of AMPA in each wetland increased with a concomitant decrease in the mass of glyphosate, suggesting that glyphosate degradation was occurring in the water column. In addition, glyphosate was also lost from the water column via sorption to bottom sediment, as evidenced by its detection in sediment samples up to 42 -d post-treatment (39. 0 – 224. 5 µg kg- 1). The DT 50 of the other six acid herbicides ranged from 2. 3 d (bromoxynil) to 31 d (dichlorprop). The two chiral herbicides, mecoprop-P and dichlorprop, were the most persistent acid herbicides in the water column. Sorption to sediment was also an important dissipation route for these six herbicides in water, especially in wetland E. After 77 d in the semi-permanent wetland and 56 d in the ephemeral wetland, the concentrations of bromoxynil, dicamba and 2, 4 -D were below the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. Concentrations of the more persistent herbicides (mecoprop-P and dichlorprop) remained at levels above the guidelines. Use of bromide ion as a conservative tracer indicated that some of the water loss from both wetlands was via infiltration. Because there was a strong correlation between the decrease in bromide ion and herbicide mass in the water column, it is possible some herbicides were lost from the water column along with the infiltrating water. Infiltration to wetland margins during this part of the growing season would have been largely driven by the riparian vegetation surrounding both wetlands. Overall, this thesis demonstrated the importance of sediment in the dissipation of currently used herbicides in wetland ecosystems. Both laboratory sorption studies and whole-wetland experiments provided insights on the sorptivity of herbicides in sediment as well as their persistence in water and sediment...|$|E
