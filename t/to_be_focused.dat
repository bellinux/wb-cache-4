5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused,</b> remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and he felt {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{membership}} {{dropped to}} a low of 11,000 in 155 squadrons and the Air Cadet program underwent a transformation to reflect the changing needs of Canada and the cadets. The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer courses were offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation. Interest was renewed; by 1961, 332 squadrons were in existence and in 1972, authority was given for membership of up to 28,000 cadets.|$|E

5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

25|$|Spherical concave and convex mirrors do {{not focus}} {{parallel}} rays {{to a single}} point due to spherical aberration. However, the ideal of focusing to a point is a commonly used approximation. Parabolic reflectors resolve this, allowing incoming parallel rays (for example, light from a distant star) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> to a small spot; almost an ideal point. Parabolic reflectors are not suitable for imaging nearby objects because the light rays are not parallel.|$|E
25|$|The use of two lasers to {{heat the}} sample reduces the axial {{temperature}} gradient, this which allows for thicker samples to be heated more evenly.

50|$|To induce myopia {{in lower}} {{as well as}} higher vertebrates, {{translucent}} goggles can be sutured over the eye, either before or after natural eye opening. Form-deprived myopia (FDM) induced with a diffuser, like the goggles mentioned, shows significant myopic shifts. Imposing retinal blur (or defocus) with positive (myopic defocus, that causes the image <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focussed</b> {{in front of the}} retina) and negative lenses (hyperopic defocus, that causes the image <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focussed</b> behind the retina) has also <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> result in predictable changes in eye growth of various animal models, whereby the eye alters its growth to effectively eliminate the lens induced blur. Anatomically, the changes in axial length of the eye seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the major factor contributing to this type of myopia. Diurnal growth rhythms of the eye have also <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> play a large part in FDM, and have been implicated in refractive error development of human eyes. Chemically, daytime retinal dopamine levels drop about 30%.|$|R

25|$|The ocelli {{of insects}} bear a simple lens, but their focal point always lies behind the retina; {{consequently}} {{they can never}} form a sharp image. Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush {{the information to the}} brain. Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity.|$|E

25|$|Defects in vision can be {{explained}} using optical principles. As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the eye, a condition known as presbyopia. Similarly, people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough to allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Conversely, people who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant objects to be imaged on the retina suffer from myopia and have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as astigmatism results when the cornea is not spherical but instead is more curved in one direction. This causes horizontally extended objects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on {{different parts of the}} retina than vertically extended objects, and results in distorted images.|$|E
25|$|Geobiology is a {{field of}} {{scientific}} research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid.

Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology and geology {{to the study of}} the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> on microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|Ocular aberrations are {{generally}} measured using a wavefront sensor, {{and the most}} commonly used type of wavefront sensor is the Shack-Hartmann. Ocular aberrations are caused by spatial phase nonuniformities in the wavefront exiting the eye. In a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, these are measured by placing a two-dimensional array of small lenses (lenslets) in a pupil plane conjugate to the eye's pupil, and a CCD chip at the back focal plane of the lenslets. The lenslets cause spots <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> onto the CCD chip, and the positions of these spots are calculated using a centroiding algorithm. The positions of these spots are compared with the positions of reference spots, and the displacements between the two are used to determine the local curvature of the wavefront—an estimate of the phase nonuniformities causing aberration.|$|E
