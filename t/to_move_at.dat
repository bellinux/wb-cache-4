5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across {{many parts of the}} United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> faster speeds, with few or no stoplights on the way. The wide-open spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E

5|$|When the 4th Division was relieved, {{they were}} sent to the Saint-Mihiel area, where they would {{undertake}} a small support role. Major Middleton was given the task of directing the unit's transport, complicated by the requirement <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> night with equipment and personnel to be drawn by horse and mule. After Saint-Mihiel, the unit was moved to Verdun where hundreds of thousands of French and Germans had become casualties earlier in the war. This would become the last major engagement of the First World War for Middleton, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 17 September, shortly before the commencement of the operation, called the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.|$|E

5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> <b>At</b> 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued to plow and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Napoleon had {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the main army at the Austrian center. Klenau's force stood on the immediate right flank of the center, opposite the attacking force of Lannes. The French cavalry, in reserve, prepared <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> either flank, or to the center, depending on where the Austrian line broke first. The French nearly broke through at the center but, at the last minute, Charles arrived with his last reserve, leading his soldiers with a color in his hand. Lannes was checked, and the impetus of the attack died out all along the line. In the final hours of the battle, Lannes himself was cut down by a cannonball from Klenau's artillery. Aspern was lost to the French. The Danube bridges upon which the French relied had been cut again by heavy barges, which the Austrians had released on the river. When he lost his route across the river, Napoleon at once suspended the attack. For his leadership at Essling, Klenau received the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Dover, Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony on November 14, 1532. She soon became pregnant and, to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time, {{there was a second}} wedding service, also private in accordance with The Royal Book, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. Events now began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> a quick pace. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope's assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham) sat in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He thereupon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also began}} to merge with a {{low-level}} frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita. The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant. In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further. While continuing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> a quick pace, the storm began to turn towards the southeast along a baroclinic zone. Early on January26, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics. Arthur re-intensified shortly after and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100UTC. The brief re-strengthening {{was the result of}} a breakdown in the baroclinic zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the center. Around the same time, Arthur left RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Wellington's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200UTC on January27, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 7, the eye began to {{reappear}} and the storm turned towards the northwest and the foreword motion began to rapidly increase. Later that morning, Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40mi (55 to 65km/h) wide eye and the foreword motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located {{to the north of}} Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest at a rapid pace of 30mph (48km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherstatus late on November 7. By {{the morning of}} November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> 58mph (93km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that morning, Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds.|$|E
5|$|Only D Company—which {{had been}} holding the summit and had {{withdrawn}} last—was heavily engaged and was unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>at</b> the scheduled time. The Chinese launched a determined assault, preceding it with heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, before attempting to overrun the forward pits. Once again the Australians repelled the Chinese assault and Gravener decided to begin to thin out his position before the situation deteriorated further. With one platoon covering their movement, D Company subsequently withdrew, closely pursued by the Chinese. During the rapid withdrawal after the final Chinese attack, Private Keith Gwyther was accidentally left behind after being knocked unconscious and buried in a forward pit by a mortar round. He regained consciousness some hours later and was subsequently captured by the Chinese who had by then occupied Hill 504 and were digging-in. Finally, the Australians succeeded in achieving a clean break after dark, and D Company was able to safely withdraw. By 23:30 the battalion was clear, completing its withdrawal in good order and intact, and suffering only minimal casualties. Regardless, the previous 24 hours of fighting had been costly for the Australians, resulting in 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured; the bulk of them in A Company and Battalion Headquarters. Yet their stout defence had halted {{the assault on the}} brigade's right flank, and had inflicted far heavier casualties on the Chinese before being withdrawn. Significantly for the Australians 25 April was Anzac Day; however, following their successful withdrawal the Chinese turned their attention to the Canadians on the left flank.|$|E
