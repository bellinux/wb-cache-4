2500|$|At {{least one}} {{reviewer}} has criticized Survive This for not mentioning Code's death or warning kids not to imitate {{what they see}} on the show. The Globe and Mail reviewer Catherine Dawson March wrote, [...] "You'd think, just seven weeks after Code's headline-making death, that Survive This would make a passing nod to the tragedy. ... Some kind of 'don't try <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own' advice. But no." [...] Dawson praised the show as [...] "captivating" [...] with [...] "lots of emotional drama", but concluded: [...] "It's great stuff, but YTV should acknowledge Code's death with a warning of their own." [...] YTV replied, [...] "As Survive This does not follow the same premise as Survivorman, {{there will not be}} a disclaimer before each episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|Muawiyah {{worked as}} a scribe for Muhammad. According to al-Baladhuri, Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, {{relating}} from his father, Aisha said [...] "I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, {{who was in a}} room with Umm Habiba (Muawiyah's sister and Muhammad's wife) on her day. Muawiya knocked on the door and he gave him permission to enter, which he did. He had a pen behind his ear which he had not used. The Prophet said, 'What is <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> ear?' He said, 'A pen which I have made ready for Allah and His Messenger.' The Prophet said. 'May Allah repay you well on behalf of your Prophet! By Allah, I will only ask you to write down revelation from heaven." [...] According to Ibn Kathir in his book Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, Ibn Abbas said that Abu Sufyan asked Muhammad if he could make his son Muawiyah a scribe which Muhammad granted. Therefore, Muawiyah became his scribe.|$|E

Father Time, dear Miss Gracedieu, has always been a good friend of mine, because I know how to make the best use of him. The author of the famous saying Tempus fugit (you understand Latin, of course) was, I take leave to think, an idle man. The more I have to do, the readier Time is to wait for me. Let me impress <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> mind by some interesting examples. The greatest conqueror of the century--Napoleon--had time enough for everything. The greatest novelist of the century--Sir Walter Scott--had time enough for everything. At my humble distance, I imitate those illustrious men, and my patients never complain of me." ...|$|E

Waddington," [...] he went on, looking up, [...] "I was beginning to get terrified. I had only two beans left. I have parted with them. They could have lasted me only a few months. I thought if I had to go back, I would go back free from any anxieties of work in an office. Wealth must help one somehow. If I can travel, surround myself with books, live in the country, I can't ever be so bad, I can't fall back where I was before. What do you think, Mr. Waddington? You must have <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> mind sometimes. You yourself have only six or seven months left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{returned}} my uncle, [...] "should {{you hang}} up things less interesting than your wall paper, in mere imitation of your neighbours? For <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> walls, Bagshot, deny it though you may, is not art but fashion. I tell you, {{you do not}} care a rap for art. You think pictures {{are a part of}} virtue, like a silk hat--or evening dress at dinner. And in your choice of pictures you follow after your kind. I never met a true-born Briton yet who dared to buy a picture on his own accord--unless he was a dealer. And then usually he was not really a true-born Briton. He waits to see what is being hung. He has these things now because he thinks they are right, not because they are beautiful, just as he used to have the Stag at Bay and the Boastful Hound. It is Leighton now; it was Landseer then. Really I believe that very soon the ladies' papers will devote a column to pictures. Something in this style. 'Smart people are taking down their Rossetti's Annunciations now, and are hanging Gambler Bolton's new Hippopotamus in the place of it. This Hippopotamus is to be the correct thing in pictures this year, and no woman with any claim to be considered smart will fail to have it over her piano. Marcus Stone's new engraving will also be rather chic. Watts's Hope is now considered a little dowdy.' And so forth. This gregarious admiration is the very antithesis of artistic appreciation, which I tell you, simply must be individual." ...|$|E
