40|$|In 1920 Prandtl {{published}} an analytical {{solution for the}} bearing capacity of a centric loaded strip footing on a weightless in-finite half-space, based on a so-called Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Reissner extended this solution for a surrounding surcharge and Keverling Buisman and Terzaghi for the soil weight. Meyerhof and other researchers presented correction factors for {{the shape of the}} shallow foundation, which would suggest that, the failure mechanism of circular shallow foundations, is related to the Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Meyerhof and Koppejan adapted this Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism also for pile foundations. The numerical calculations made in this article show that the Prandtl-wedge cannot be applied to circular shallow foundations and pile foundations in non-cohesive soils. The failure zone (plastic zone) below a loaded circular plate or pile tip, is far wider and deeper than the Prandtl-wedge. The calculations also show that there is, for these axisymmetric cases, failure {{both in and out of}} the standard x-y plane, but most of the failure is due to out-of-plane (tangential) failure. Therefore, this failure mechanism is different from the Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Also interesting are the circular and diagonal <b>thin</b> <b>zones</b> below the plate and around the pile tip, where there is no out-of-plane failure, although there is still in-plane failure. In these <b>thin</b> <b>zones</b> without out-of-plane failure, the tangential (out-of-plane) stresses are relatively high due to large shear strains, formed during previous shearing or sliding of the soil...|$|R

5000|$|Another related kind of {{intergranular}} corrosion is termed knifeline attack (KLA). Knifeline attack impacts steels stabilized by niobium, such as 347 stainless steel. Titanium, niobium, and their carbides dissolve in steel {{at very high}} temperatures. At some cooling regimes (depending on the rate of cooling), niobium carbide does not precipitate and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a <b>thin</b> <b>zone</b> several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, {{making it difficult to}} spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have to be heated in a whole to about 1065 °C (1950 °F), when the chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment is not important, as the carbon that would otherwise pose risk of formation of chromium carbide is already sequestered as niobium carbide.http://httd.njuct.edu.cn/MatWeb/corrosie/c_iga.htm ...|$|E

30|$|Compared to the {{footwall}} damage zones, {{the hanging}} wall has <b>thinner</b> shear <b>zones</b> of 2.3 to 18.6  m thickness, possibly due to higher porosity and lower shear {{strength in the}} footwall {{as a result of}} deep burial in the hanging wall and accumulation of displacement across the fault. In addition to the contrast in physical properties across the fault, the hanging wall may have developed <b>thinner</b> shear <b>zones</b> because strain was partitioned between the preexisting turbiditic sequence of alternating shale/sandstone-dominant intervals, and deformation was concentrated in the sandstone-rich intervals. In contrast, faults and fractures are more sporadically distributed in the footwall likely due to less partitioning of strain within the sandstone block-in-shale matrix structure, creating thicker shear zones as a whole.|$|R

50|$|Within the Green River Formation of {{southwest}} Wyoming {{in the area}} known as Fossil Lake, two distinct zones of very fine-grained lime muds are particularly noted for preserving a variety of complete and detailed fossils. These layers are an Eocene Lagerstätte, a rare place where conditions were right for a rich accumulation of undisturbed fossils.

5000|$|Bats are not, in fact, blind, {{but they}} depend {{much more on}} {{echolocation}} than vision for navigation and prey capture.

Echoes coming from different directions activate neurons at different locations in the collicular layers, and activation of collicular neurons influences the chirps that the bats emit. Thus, there is a strong case that the superior colliculus performs the same sorts of functions for the auditory-guided behaviors of bats that it performs for the visual-guided behaviors of other species.|$|E
5000|$|Most protein separations are {{performed}} using a [...] "discontinuous" [...] (or DISC) buffer system that significantly enhances {{the sharpness of}} the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band. The formation of the ion gradient is achieved by choosing a pH value at which the ions of the buffer are only moderately charged compared to the SDS-coated proteins. These conditions provide {{an environment in which}} Kohlrausch's reactions determine the molar conductivity. As a result, SDS-coated proteins are concentrated to several fold in a <b>thin</b> <b>zone</b> of the order of 19 μm within a few minutes. At this stage all proteins migrate at the same migration speed by isotachophoresis. This occurs in a region of the gel that has larger pores so that the gel matrix does not retard the migration during the focusing or [...] "stacking" [...] event. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, [...] "resolving" [...] region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins. At the same time, the separating part of the gel also has a pH value in which the buffer ions on average carry a greater charge, causing them to [...] "outrun" [...] the SDS-covered proteins and eliminate the ion gradient and thereby the stacking effect.|$|E

Along the southern margin of the Tarannon belt, the Wenlock and Ludlow rocks follow in normal order, the boundary between the two being defined by a line extending from the head of the Ewes Water in Eskdale, southwest by Lockerbie to Mouswald. These consist of greywackes, flags and shales with bands of dark graptolite shales, the finer sediments being often well ground. They are likewise repeated by inverted folds, the axial planes being usually inclined to the southeast. The Silurian tableland in the {{northwest of the}} county is pierced by intrusive igneous rocks in the form of dikes and bosses, which are regarded as of Lower Old Red Sandstone age. Of these, the granite mass of Spango Water, northeast of Kirkconnel, is an excellent example. Along the northwest margin of the county, {{on the north side of}} the fault bounding the Silurian tableland, the Lower Old Red Sandstone occurs, where it consists of sandstones and conglomerates associated with contemporaneous volcanic rocks. The Upper Old Red Sandstone forms a narrow strip on the south side of the Silurian tableland, resting uncomfortably on the Silurian rocks and passing upwards into the Carboniferous formation.
