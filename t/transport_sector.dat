5|$|Through {{the gradual}} {{replacement}} of {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles for electric cars and plug-in hybrids, electric drive vehicles can contribute significantly to lessen the dependence of the <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> on imported oil as well as contributing {{to the development of}} a more resilient energy supply.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the <b>transport</b> <b>sector.</b> Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E

5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> were still riddled with {{problems}} due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people. The underdeveloped Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport. The nation's merchant fleet {{was one of the}} largest in the world.|$|E

25|$|On 27 March 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to lend $250 million to BMRC to part-finance Phase 2 of the metro rail project.

The loan, approved by the ADB Board in March 2011, is the first ADB loan to the urban <b>transport</b> <b>sector</b> without recourse to sovereign guarantees. In 2016, the Agence Francaise De Development (AFD) sanctioned a 1,600 crore loan for the project. The rate of interest on the loan is linked to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) + 130 basis points. In early 2017, the European Investment Bank agreed to loan 3,700 crore to the BMRCL, with a repayment period of 20 years {{at a rate of}} interest lower than the one on the AFD loan.|$|E

Differences in the perceptions between the 15 European states studied concerning the balance between regulatory and market failure {{and the importance of}} externalities are identified. As a result, it is concluded that the structure of the European transport system is currently something of a patchwork quilt.
