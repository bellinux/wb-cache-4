25|$|Gordon {{took part}} in the {{expedition}} to Kinburn, and returned to Sevastopol at the war's end. During the Crimean war, Gordon picked up an addiction to <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes</b> which was to last for his rest of his life, and many commented that smoking was Gordon's most conspicuous vice as he always seemed to have a cigarette at his lips.|$|R
60|$|Ruth conceded none {{of these}} things. Throughout the {{interview}} Hank sat bolt upright, tucking {{a pair of shoes}} of the dreadnought class coyly underneath his chair, and drew suspiciously at <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes</b> from Kirk's case. An air of constraint hung over the party. Again and again Kirk hoped that Hank would embark on the epic of his life, but shyness kept Hank dumb.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} smoking {{behaviour}} of primary schoolchildren {{and their ability}} to recognise brand names and logos of widely advertised cigarettes, compared with other commercial products intended for children.  DESIGN—Cross-sectional survey in classroom settings using a questionnaire designed to measure attitudes towards smoking and the recognition of brand names and logos for 16  food, beverage, cigarette, and toothpaste products.  SETTING—Ankara, Turkey.  SUBJECTS— 1093 children (54. 6 % boys, 44. 4 % girls) aged 7 - 13 years (mean = 10, SD = 1), from grades 2 - 5. The student sample was taken from three primary schools—one school in each of three residential districts representing high, middle, and low income populations.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Prevalence of ever-smoking, recognition of brand names and logos.  RESULTS—Prevalence of ever-smoking was 11. 7 % overall (13. 9 % among boys and 9. 1 % among girls; p< 0. 05). Children aged eight years or less had a higher prevalence of ever-smoking (19. 6 %) than older children (p< 0. 002). Ever-smoking prevalence did not differ significantly across the three school districts. Ever-smoking prevalence was higher among children with at least one parent who smoked (15. 3 %) than among those whose parents did not (4. 8 %) (p< 0. 001). Brand recognition rates ranged from 58. 1 % for Chee-tos (a food product) to 95. 2 % for Samsun (a <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarette</b> brand). Recognition rates for cigarette brand names and logos were 95. 2 % and 80. 8 %, respectively, for Samsun; 84. 0 % and 90. 5 %, respectively, for Camel; and 92. 1 % and 69. 5 %, respectively, for Marlboro. The Camel logo and the Samsun and Marlboro brand names were the most highly recognised of all product logos and brand names tested.  CONCLUSIONS—The high recognition of cigarette brand names and logos is most likely the result of tobacco advertising and promotion. Our results indicate the need to implement comprehensive tobacco control measures in Turkey.    Keywords: advertising; brand recognition; children; Turke...|$|E
60|$|After {{walking for}} some time, Foster heard a rumble in the {{distance}} behind him and climbed the rocky bank of the single-line track. There was not much room between the bank and rails, and he was glad of an excuse for sitting down. Taking out the stranger's case, he lighted another of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> They were the only benefit he was likely to derive from the adventure, and he felt some satisfaction in making use of them.|$|R
60|$|They {{left the}} {{shipping}} office {{and walked back}} to the hotel. Here they had a late breakfast and then commenced to make diligent inquiries concerning all the movements of Merwell and Jasniff. They soon learned that the pair had had plenty of money to spend, and that they had bought many things for the trip to Barbados, even taking along an extra supply of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes</b> that came in the boxes with bands of blue and gold.|$|R

50|$|I {{kept looking}} at the part and {{wondered}} how I could crack it, because {{he was such a}} straitlaced character. And then I realized that if he thought he was trendy and avant-garde, that added a whole new swing to it. I see him as quite the star of his theological college, probably quite daring with his <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> And I imagine that he even makes the occasional sexual reference in his conversation after a couple of glasses of sherry. But confronted with the real McCoy, in the form of Elle Macpherson without her clothes, he's hopeless.|$|R
60|$|A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, {{a pair of}} new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, {{redolent of}} opoponax, {{jessamine}} and Muratti's <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly {{on the top of}} a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).|$|R

6000|$|HE sat smoking {{with the}} piano-salesman, {{clinging}} to the warm refuge of gossip, afraid to venture into thoughts of Paul. He was the more affable on the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive, felt more hollow. He was certain that Paul was in Chicago without Zilla's knowledge, {{and that he was}} doing things not at all moral and secure. When the salesman yawned that he had to write up his orders, Babbitt left him, left the hotel, in leisurely calm. But savagely he said [...] "Campbell Inn!" [...] to the taxi-driver. He sat agitated on the slippery leather seat, in that chill dimness which smelled of dust and perfume and <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> He did not heed the snowy lake-front, the dark spaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land south of the Loop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bring me one, too, please," [...] Caroline begged. [...] "I {{fear that}} it will seriously impair the note which I had {{intended}} to strike in our conversation, but I am thirsty. And a handful of those <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> too. You can devote yourself {{to me with a}} perfectly clear conscience. Your most distinguished guest has found a task after his own heart. He has got Henry {{in a corner of the}} billiard-room and is trying to convince him of what I am sure the dear man really believes himself--that Germany's intentions towards England are of a particularly dove-like nature. Your Right Honourable guest has gone to bed, and Eddy Pelham is playing billiards with Mr. Mangan. Every one is happy. You can devote yourself to soothing my wounded vanity, to say nothing of my broken heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carl's father {{assured him}} in every letter {{that he was}} extravagant. He ran through the two dollars in {{practically}} no time at all. He was a member in good and regular standing of the informal club that hung about the Corner Drug Store, to drink coffee soda and discuss athletics {{and stare at the}} passing girls. He loved to set off his clear skin and shining pale hair with linen collars, though soft roll-collar shirts were in vogue. And he was ready for any wild expedition, though it should cost fifty or sixty cents. With the sophomore second vice-president and John Terry of the freshman class (usually known as [...] "the Turk") he often tramped to the large neighboring town of Jamaica Mills to play pool, smoke <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> and drink beer. They always chorused Plato songs, in long-drawn close harmony. Once they had imported English ale, out of bottles, and carried the bottles back to decorate and distinguish their rooms.|$|R
60|$|Mitchell {{was a young}} gentleman of rich but honest parents, who {{had left}} the school at Christmas. He was in his father's office, and lived in his father's house on the {{outskirts}} of the town. From time to time his father went up to London on matters connected with business, leaving him alone in the house. On these occasions Mitchell the younger would write to Stanning, with whom when at school he had been on friendly terms; and Stanning, breaking out of his house after everybody had gone to bed, would make his way to the Mitchell residence, and spend a pleasant hour or so there. Mitchell senior owned <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and a billiard table. Stanning appreciated both. There was also a piano, and Stanning had brought Sheen with him one night to play it. The getting-out and the subsequent getting-in had nearly whitened Sheen's hair, and it was only by a series of miracles that he had escaped detection. Once, he felt, was more than enough; and when a fag from Appleby's had brought him Stanning's note, containing an invitation to a second jaunt of the kind, he had refused to be lured into the business again.|$|R
60|$|They did so, {{and were}} served with <b>Turkish</b> coffee and <b>cigarettes,</b> which Madame Riennes smoked {{one after the}} other very rapidly. Presently Miss Ogilvy rang the bell, and when the butler {{appeared}} to remove the cups, whispered something in French, at which he bowed and departed.|$|R

They smoke a <b>Turkish</b> brand of <b>cigarettes,</b> having a peculiar blue and gold band around the box. This is {{the same kind of}} a box, and I am convinced that this box was emptied and thrown away in your offices by Jasniff or Merwell.” ...|$|R
50|$|Ari Shamron — {{former head}} of the Office. A Polish-born Jew from Lviv, his parents sent him to Israel as a {{teenager}} before the war; consequently he was the only member from his entire extended family to survive the Holocaust. Shamron is a father figure and mentor to Gabriel and the person who recruited him into the Office with the three-year Wrath of God operation. To Allon and his team, he's known as the Memuneh (Hebrew for 'the one in charge'). He is officially retired {{as the head of the}} Office, but it still remains his private fiefdom; he groomed and raised an entire generation of its officers, many of whom comprise much of the service's current senior management and executive staff. Eventually after the departure of two of his successors, he makes Uzi Navot the director general of the Office after finally giving up trying to perpetually force Gabriel to take the job (who repeatedly refused to accept the position). He is known throughout the Israeli intelligence community as the Old Man, being one of the last remaining members of the generation of spymasters who founded the state back in 1948 and as a result whose advice and counsel is still sought out regularly by the highest ranking leaders of the current Israeli defense and security establishment. While his age isn't explicitly referenced (or consistent through the series) his aging and health is of concern to Allon and his team; it is mentioned many times that he is also an incessant chain-smoker of sixty filthy, vile-smelling <b>Turkish</b> <b>cigarettes</b> daily. Gilah, Ari's long suffering wife, frequently plays a role as a mother figure to Gabriel and his team. Shamron's niece Rimona Stern is a key figure in Gabriel's team. While Shamron's character is clearly based in history (he is known to Gabriel and his team well as most Israelis as the man who apprehended Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires) his real-world character is never identified in the novels. However, in an interview, Silva said that Shamron is a composite of several historical figures including Isser Harel, head of Mossad when Eichmann was apprehended. Following this connection, Harel wanted to meet Silva, but they were not able to establish a meeting before Harel died.|$|R
