He also had a deep love of music and dreamed of it as a possible career.|$|E

He gave up his {{immediate}} plans to chase Willie Ritchie and stayed in Wales {{for a while to}} be near his family. He fought four more fights in Britain, beginning with a home contest at Aberdare against Frenchman Paul Brevieres, who was stopped in the third. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> points win over Young Nipper, a successful defence of his European title against Raymond Vittet, finishing with a points win over Eddie Beattie. The three final fights were conducted within seven days, and Welsh almost paid the price for such a challenging schedule when Beattie knocked him down for nine seconds in the ninth.|$|E
2500|$|By July 18, the Spanish Army of Africa {{had seized}} all of Spanish Morocco and crushed the resistance. The same day, Francisco Franco started the {{rising in the}} Canary Islands. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> plane, paid for by Luis Bolín, and flew to Casablanca in French Morocco. On July 19, Franco {{continued}} on to Tetuan and appointed himself chief of the Spanish Army in Morocco. Nevertheless, most of the Republican Navy remained loyal to the government. The loyal ships patrolled the Straits and Spanish Morocco was isolated from the rebel-held cities in Andalusia (Seville, Cadiz, Cordoba and Granada). Nevertheless, {{with the aid of}} [...] Nazi Germany and [...] Fascist Italy, the Nationalists managed to transport the Army of Africa's troops to the mainland and start their advance towards Madrid.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885, Cavafy {{returned}} to Alexandria, {{where he lived}} {{for the rest of}} his life. [...] His first work was as a journalist; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> position with the British-run Egyptian Ministry of Public Works for thirty years. (Egypt was a British protectorate until 1926.) He published his poetry from 1891 to 1904 in the form of broadsheets, and only for his close friends. [...] Any acclaim he was to receive came mainly from within the Greek community of Alexandria. [...] Eventually, in 1903, he was introduced to mainland-Greek literary circles through a favourable review by Xenopoulos. [...] He received little recognition because his style differed markedly from the then-mainstream Greek poetry. [...] It was only twenty years later, after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), that a new generation of almost nihilist poets (e.g. Karyotakis) would find inspiration in Cavafy's work.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 1906 Voigt {{was ready}} for his next caper. He had {{purchased}} parts of used captain's uniforms from different shops and tested their effect on soldiers. He had resigned from the shoe factory ten days previously. He took the uniform out of baggage storage, put it on {{and went to the}} local army barracks, stopped four grenadiers and a sergeant on their way back to barracks and told them to come with him. Indoctrinated to obey officers without question, they followed. He dismissed the commanding sergeant to report to his superiors and later commandeered six more soldiers from a shooting range. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> train to Köpenick, east of Berlin, occupied the local city hall with his soldiers and told them to cover all exits. He told the local police to [...] "care for law and order" [...] and to [...] "prevent calls to Berlin for one hour" [...] at the local post office.|$|E

60|$|The Major started, and {{was moving}} out of his corner--the seat of honour--but the {{stranger}} forbade this by another gesture, and took his place, after standing for a moment with his face hidden in his hat. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> anxious survey, not without an almost imperceptible elevation of eyebrow and shoulder, as if disappointed, and accepted the Prayer-book, which the Major offered him.|$|R
60|$|At the call, {{the horse}} pricked up {{his ears and}} looked at them curiously. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> half <b>a</b> dozen steps forward.|$|R

30|$|In {{his article}} Fuelbreaks for Wildland Fire Management, (Fire Ecology, Vol 1, Nbr 1, April 2005), Timothy Ingalsbee calls for “…a {{wider range of}} designs, methods, and uses for fuelbreaks than has been offered in the typical fuelbreak {{proposals}} of the past.” But <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> very narrow view of what recent fuelbreak proposals have actually contained, and promotes an even narrower view of how fuelbreaks should be used.|$|R
