He introduced an annual Saint Patrick's Day festival to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London, and revived London's free anti-racism music festival, now called , later attributing London's 35% decrease in racist attacks to this and other anti-racist policies. Continuing his support for LGBT rights, in 2001 he set up Britain's first register for same-sex couples; while falling short of legal marriage rights, the register was seen as a step towards the Civil Partnership Act 2004.|$|E

The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E

5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground tunnels. Filming took place on actual tube tunnels, albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because {{it would take a}} while for a crew member to leave the tunnels, have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E
5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind the scenes to ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the going rate for service that doctors charged. The medical establishment claimed that Douglas would import foreign doctors to make his plan work and used racist images to try <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|E

500|$|Davies took a {{different}} approach while writing the episode. David Tennant and Sarah Lancashire noted the character of Miss Foster had good intentions but was morally ambiguous. The premise of the Adipose pill was equally ambiguous with rare side-effects, but was a [...] "win-win situation" [...] for anyone involved. Davies based the character of Miss Foster on Supernanny star Jo Frost and Argentine philanthropist and politician Eva Perón, and Lancashire compared her character to Mary Poppins. The Adipose are {{a different}} style to regular Doctor Who villains; antagonists such as Lazarus in [...] "The Lazarus Experiment" [...] or the werewolf in [...] "Tooth and Claw" [...] were singular monsters designed <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> audience; the Adipose were written as [...] "cute" [...] to provide a [...] "bizarre [...] surreal" [...] experience.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a pun. It refers to both {{cartoonist}} Rube Goldberg, who {{was famous for}} his drawings of incredibly complex machines made out of everyday objects that performed rudimentary tasks, {{as well as the}} harpsichord piece, the [...] "Goldberg Variations", by Johann Sebastian Bach. The elaborate contraptions Henry Weems created are physical examples of such machines. Episode writer Jeffrey Bell noted that he wanted the episode to function [...] "as a Rube Goldberg device" [...] and so he wrote the story to revolve around the ideas of good luck and bad luck. Originally, the episode's opening scene was to have featured Weems falling thirty thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unscathed. Although Bell's pitch was met with enthusiasm, many writers and producers for the show were cautious, because they realized the episode would have several humorous moments. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained: [...] "The episode had a lot of humorous moments that we were afraid of doing because as many people who like the funny ones hate the funny ones." [...] Eventually, the episode was green-lighted, but pushed to later in the season because, according to Spotnitz, [...] "we wanted <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> hell out of everybody during the first few episodes." ...|$|E

When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [...] "Evil Empire's" [...] defeat. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union {{was on the verge}} of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>the</b> people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.|$|E
