5|$|In April, Raonic {{opened the}} Monte-Carlo Masters {{with a victory}} over João Sousa. Just one game into his second-round match against Tommy Robredo, Raonic called for a medical <b>timeout</b> due to a right foot injury. Although {{he went on to}} win the match, Raonic's manager {{indicated}} that Raonic had made a pre-existing injury worse by playing. In his quarterfinal match against Berdych, he complained of numbness in his right foot during a medical <b>timeout,</b> and retired while trailing 2–5 in the opening set. It was diagnosed as a pinched nerve, and Raonic was expected to be healthy for the Madrid Open.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second-and-nine at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a 20-yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. Parker ran for three yards, but Tech was forced to call a <b>timeout</b> before the next play. During the <b>timeout,</b> a light rain began to fall that would last through {{the remainder of the}} game. Coming out of the <b>timeout,</b> Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, but made it up on the next play by rushing for 16 yards, picking up a first down at the 41-yard line of Nebraska. This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller, this time for nine yards. The two gains were negated on the next play, however, as Virginia Tech committed a penalty that pushed the Hokies back to their 41-yard line. Druckenmiller then threw two incomplete passes, and Tech was forced to punt.|$|E
5|$|Tech's offense {{took the}} field at their 20-yard line with 1:53 {{remaining}} in the game, two timeouts left (used to stop the clock as necessary), and needing at least a field goal to win the game. Tech picked up one first down via a pass, then another as the Hokies drove to their 44-yard line. Stopped short of midfield {{with less than a}} minute to play, Tech called its second <b>timeout</b> in order to stop the game clock from ticking down. In college football, the clock stops after a team earns a first down, and because Virginia Tech had not earned a first down on the short run, Tech was forced to call the <b>timeout.</b> Following the <b>timeout,</b> the Hokies ran for a first down, penetrating to the NC State 44-yard line. With 53seconds remaining, Chapman scrambled out of bounds on a short run. Another short run brought the Hokies to the State 36-yard line, and the Hokies called their final <b>timeout</b> to stop the clock. A few plays later, Tech ran a short running play that kept the clock running down. With just 33seconds remaining and no other way to stop the clock, Tech's Maurice Williams questionably stayed down with a leg cramp and the referees stopped the clock to allow the injured player to receive assistance from athletic trainers before the next play. Facing fourth down and needing three yards for drive-continuing first down, Chapman passed for a first down at the State 29-yard line with 15seconds remaining in the game. On the game's next play, Tech committed a holding penalty, which pushed the Hokies 10yards further away from the end zone, out of field goal range, with 11seconds remaining.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Timeouts</b> play a {{fundamental}} role in network protocols, controlling numerous aspects of host behavior at different {{layers of the}} protocol stack. Previous work has documented a class of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that leverage <b>timeouts</b> to force a host to preserve state with a bare minimum level of interactivity with the attacker. This paper considers the vulnerability of operational Web servers to such attacks by comparing <b>timeouts</b> implemented in servers with the normal Web activity that informs our understanding as to the necessary length of <b>timeouts.</b> We then use these two results—which generally show that the <b>timeouts</b> in wide use are long relative to normal Web transactions—to devise a framework to augment static <b>timeouts</b> with both measurements of the system and particular policy decisions in times of high load. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last <b>timeout</b> in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|Despite being pinned {{against their}} own goal line, the Hokies {{initially}} had some success moving the ball. Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line. After a Tech <b>timeout,</b> Darren Evans ran for five yards. On the next play, he broke free for a 32-yard run, advancing {{the ball to the}} 50-yard line. The Hokies were unable to capitalize on Evans' run, however, as on the next play, a pass from Taylor was intercepted by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood at the Cincinnati 28-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} to cut Nebraska's lead before halftime. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback, and Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 20-yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a carry to the left. From the Tech 40-yard line, Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska's {{half of the}} field. Nebraska committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty. Virginia Tech was forced to use a <b>timeout</b> {{in order to stop}} the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third-down play. With 57 seconds remaining in the first half, Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a five-yard pass to Cornelius White, but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line, Tech was again forced to call a <b>timeout</b> to stop the clock with 25 seconds remaining. On the next play, Druckenmiller completed a six-yard pass to Shawn Scales for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The score came with 19 seconds remaining in the first half, and the extra point was good, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2007, Judah {{made his}} return to the ring against Ruben Galvan at the Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi. Judah came out {{strongly}} in the first round, landing numerous shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a <b>timeout</b> to allow the doctor {{to take a look at}} the cut. Due to the severity of the cut, the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E
5|$|On the game's next play, Chapman {{passed the}} ball deep, {{toward the end}} zone. Though the pass fell incomplete, a game {{official}} called a 15-yard pass interference penalty against NC State. This moved {{the ball to the}} NC State 23-yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game-winning 40-yard field goal with four seconds remaining. Though NC State coach Dick Sheridan called a <b>timeout</b> in an attempt to ice Chris Kinzer, the kick sailed through the uprights and Virginia Tech won a 2524 victory as time expired.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{researches}} on TCP performance {{show that}} spurious <b>timeouts</b> {{due to an}} unexpected delay increase can considerably degrade TCP performance. When experiencing spurious <b>timeouts,</b> common TCP implementations misjudge the long delay {{as an indication of}} packet loss and prematurely resort to loss recovery. To diminish the consequent penalty, the TCP Eifel algorithms have been introduced to detect the occurrence of spurious <b>timeouts</b> and properly revert to the congestion control status. In this work, we extend the OPNET TCP model with both the Eifel detection and response algorithms, compare simulation results among different TCP flavors, and present a deep investigation on how the Eifel algorithms improve TCP performance under spurious <b>timeouts...</b>|$|R

Thus, if a desktop disk without TLER starts delaying a response to a sector read, FreeBSD will retry the read with successively longer <b>timeouts</b> to prevent prematurely dropping the disk out of the array.|$|R
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a <b>timeout.</b> Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a <b>timeout</b> and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} Saturday, May 9, when the Brown Bears {{traveled}} {{to face the}} eighth-seeded Johns Hopkins Blue Jays at Homewood Field in Baltimore. The Blue Jays pulled away to three-goal leads {{in the first and}} final quarters, but the Bears equalized both times. In the final ten seconds of regulation, Brown attackman Kyle Hollingsworth batted in a loose ball to even the score, 11–11. In overtime, Hopkins won the faceoff and called a <b>timeout,</b> before Brian Christopher drove up {{the right side of the}} field and made a game-winning top-corner shot on the run. It was the third overtime goal by Christopher in Hopkins' past four games.|$|E
5|$|This {{turned out}} to be unnecessary, however, as Tyler Fredrickson's punt was {{returned}} 52yards by Virginia Tech's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. Hall's return tied the game at 49–49, and with 3:11 remaining in the game, California took over on offense. On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The Bears' Chris Murphy jumped on the ball, preventing what otherwise might have been a game-losing turnover. Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes: first to J. J. Arrington for 11yards, then to Brandon Hall for 18yards and a first down, then to Burl Toler for 22yards and another first down. The last play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the Tech 20-yard line, Rodgers rushed for a five-yard gain, then prepared the offense for a potential game-winning field goal kick. With twoseconds remaining on the clock, California called <b>timeout</b> and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson. Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to ice the kicker by calling its final <b>timeout,</b> Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35-yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired. The kick gave California three points and the 52–49 victory.|$|E
50|$|Kansas {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} give themselves another chance at offense by calling <b>timeouts</b> after Kansas rushed the ball. The <b>timeouts</b> stopped the clock, but Kansas managed {{to earn a}} first down and run out the clock after Tech used its allotted three <b>timeouts.</b> Heading into halftime, Kansas still had the lead and the momentum, but a Virginia Tech touchdown had cut the Jayhawks' lead to just 10 points, 17 - 7.|$|R
40|$|Retransmission <b>timeouts</b> are {{detrimental}} to application latency, especially for short transfers such as Web transactions where <b>timeouts</b> can often {{take longer than}} all of the rest of a transaction.

This document describes an experimental algorithm for TCP to quickly recover lost segments at the end of transactions or when an entire window of data or acknowledgments are lost. Tail Loss Probe (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm that allows the transport to recover tail losses through fast recovery as opposed to lengthy retransmission <b>timeouts.</b> If a connection is not receiving any acknowledgments for a certain period of time, TLP transmits the last unacknowledged segment (loss probe).

5|$|Virginia Tech {{players and}} coaches {{attempted}} to leave the field, only to be informed that Indiana called a <b>timeout</b> with one second remaining. Despite Tech head coach Frank Beamer's protests, Indiana's Manolopoulos was {{able to return to}} the field to attempt a 51-yard goal. The kick was blocked and the ball recovered by Tech's Antonio Banks, who returned it 80yards for a touchdown. The score, which came with no time remaining on the clock, gave Tech a 2813 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|With 2:05 {{left in the}} game, Cutler began {{leading a}} two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, {{followed}} by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On {{the next set of}} downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a <b>timeout</b> with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another <b>timeout,</b> and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22–20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral {{in the early stages of}} the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each <b>timeout.</b> Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E

5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a <b>timeout</b> before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense began {{play from}} the Hoosiers' 34-yard line {{following}} the kick. Paci scrambled for several yards, then completed a {{pass for a}} first down at the 50-yard line. On the next play, however, Paci fumbled the ball, which bounced {{into the hands of}} Tech defensive end Lawrence Lewis, who returned it 20yards for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 seconds remaining before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed a pass to the 36-yard line, and the few seconds remaining in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final <b>timeout</b> to stop the clock.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs {{got off to}} a good start, {{jumping out}} to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called <b>timeout</b> and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time in}} school history.|$|E

30|$|Figure 3 d {{represents}} the mean percentage of <b>timeouts.</b> The performance {{of all the}} schemes is similar for a network with 25 nodes. In particular, we observe {{a high percentage of}} <b>timeouts</b> in low-dense networks. This {{is due to the fact}} that the probability of creating a route to DS is very low under these circumstances and the DSs are inaccessible during a non-negligible part of the simulation time. Because of this unreachability, the documents are hardly served by DS and, in turn, the nodes cannot keep copies of the documents in their caches. Thus, the way that caches are managed has no impact on this parameter in low dense networks. As the number of nodes increases the percentage of <b>timeouts</b> is drastically reduced, except for DPIP, which does not reduce the percentage of <b>timeouts.</b> In addition, the <b>timeouts</b> for MobEye largely increase with a network with 100 nodes. This is again provoked by the broadcast method employed to request the documents. For a higher network density, the amount of broadcast messages and the generated traffic drastically increase (as shown in Figure 3 b). Thus, the interferences and the saturation of the network degrade the obtained performance. Finally, we can mention that only COOP performs better than CLIR for high-density networks in terms of <b>timeouts</b> (Figure 3 d).|$|R
