The band had become {{dissatisfied with the}} music industry and music media, and decided {{to create their own}} record label to release their fourth studio album. Commenting on the dissolving [...] "indie band culture", Weinman stated, [...] "back in the day there were record labels that you trusted, loved and you bought everything on it and you discovered a lot of great new music because of it. You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before you moved onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! about the decision, he said: [...] "The most important thing was to keep evolving and changing. We didn't want to be stuck in some long contract that won't be relevant in a few years time... Or possibly even tomorrow. So half out of necessity, half out of choice, we decided to do this ourselves. <b>The</b> <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> figuring out whether you're sacrificing your creative side because you're so busy with the business. That's the challenge and we're figuring it out".|$|E

Of course this insight alone is easy to make; <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> encoding this huge amount of information into an understandable and easy-to-represent form. With TDA, there is a mathematical interpretation when the information is a homology group.

Barney waits at the bar for Robin, and when Ted, Marshall and Lily walk in, he informs them he broke up with Nora, and says <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> over. Robin arrives at the bar with Kevin, having not told him. This leaves Barney heartbroken and he excuses himself, not wanting to stick around. Ted leaves the bar soon after, as he is still high. As Ted gets back to his apartment, he sees Barney picking up rose petals off Robin's bed and blowing out the flames of candles, implying he had a whole special night planned. Ted walks to his room without saying anything.|$|E
