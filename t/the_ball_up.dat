5|$|In {{the wild}} card playoffs, the Giants built a 38–14 3rd-quarter lead against San Francisco. However, the 49ers rallied, scoring a field goal, and three touchdowns to take a 39–38 lead with a minute left in the game. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds left, setting up a {{potential}} game winning 41-yard field goal attempt for Matt Bryant. On the final play of the game, 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin — {{who had just been}} signed for this playoff game — snapped the ball low, and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball properly for the attempt. Allen picked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> and threw an unsuccessful pass downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert as time expired, and the Giants lost 39–38.|$|E
5|$|On 13 May, Del Piero started Juventus's final league game of {{the season}} against Atalanta, marking the {{occasion}} and the victory of their 28th Serie A title by scoring a goal. Twenty-seven minutes into the match, Del Piero picked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> {{at the edge of the}} penalty box and placed a shot past Giorgio Frezzolini to make the score 2–0, helping Juventus to go undefeated in Serie A that season. He was substituted off after 59 minutes to an emotional response from both sets of players and supporters, as he made a lap of honour around the pitch. This was Alessandro Del Piero's final Serie A appearance for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|Queen's went on {{the attack}} once again, with Christie going on a run but losing {{possession}} to Hargreaves. After around 30 minutes of play, Hargreaves passed the ball to his teammate Douglas {{who went on to}} score Rovers' first goal. Queen's Park then committed the second handball of the game, giving Rovers a free kick. Brown took <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> the wing, and centred it towards Forrest, who turned the ball {{into the back of the}} Queen's Park goal and put Blackburn two ahead. In response, Queen's Park's attacks on the Blackburn defence increased, and they scored through Christie before half time.|$|E

5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to the}} ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{came in and}} {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, {{but he was too}} slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half the runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used for balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Loxton came in {{with the}} score at 265/5 and {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before he fell to the new ball. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous hooks and off-drives. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through from the non-striker's end by Tallon, but was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out with Australia's score on 389, ending the tourists' innings. Both were caught by Crapp in slips from the bowling of Hollies and Bedser respectively. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin bowling; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two slow men. Hollies pitched <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into playing front-foot shots from balls that spun after pitching on off stump.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} component of Showtime was the Lakers' fast break. In a typical sequence, rebounders such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kurt Rambis, and A. C. Green would quickly release an outlet pass to Johnson, who would race down the court and distribute the ball to players such as Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy, Byron Scott, and Michael Cooper for a finishing layup or slam dunk. Oftentimes, Johnson would rebound the ball and drive <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> court himself on a fast break. He would sometimes deliver the ball to teammates with a no-look pass.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when he latched onto a defence {{splitting}} pass from Jan Mølby to round Everton goalkeeper Bobby Mimms and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, Mølby was again {{at the heart of}} another attack. Picking <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for Craig Johnston to score. Liverpool were now 2–1 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when Ronnie Whelan led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped an exquisite ball over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, thumped the ball past Mimms, knocking over a camera in the process. Liverpool held on to win 3–1 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Rush was unable to have a crack of winning another European Cup in 1986–87.|$|E
25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|E
25|$|In most cricketing countries, fast bowlers are {{considered}} to be the mainstay of a team's bowling attack, with slower bowlers in support roles. On the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the reverse is often true, with fast bowlers serving mainly to soften <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> for the spinners. This is largely due to the condition of the pitches used in those countries which gives more help to spinners than to fast bowlers, but at international level it is also a reflection of the outstanding skills of their spinners compared to their pace bowlers. Pakistan, however, is an exception in the subcontinent with a rich history of producing high quality fast bowlers.|$|E
