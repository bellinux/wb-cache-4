[...] They then approached other studios, and Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures agreed to share the production costs and were willing to be more flexible about the running time.

2500|$|Upon its release, the Kinect {{garnered}} positive opinions from reviewers and critics. IGN {{gave the}} device 7.5 out of 10, saying that [...] "Kinect {{can be a}} tremendous amount of fun for casual players, and the creative, controller-free concept is undeniably appealing", though adding that for [...] "$149.99, a motion-tracking camera add-on for Xbox 360 is a <b>tough</b> <b>sell,</b> especially considering that the entry level variation of Xbox 360 itself is only $199.99". Game Informer rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience takes a while to get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier. Computer and Video Games called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.|$|E
2500|$|Alastair Duncan, Anthony De Longis, [...] Alexis Denisof, Geraint Wyn Davies, Gary Daniels, and James Horan {{were all}} in the running for the lead role. Marc Singer who was {{originally}} offered the role of Connor MacLeod in the original movie was also a front runner for the lead before Adrian Paul was cast. [...] Dutch actor Derek de Lint was eventually cast as Conner Macleod. But for unknown reasons he left the project before production began. Adrian Paul beat out 400 hopefuls from the U.S, Canada and Europe for the lead role. Originally, the actor was a <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> to the investors because he was an unknown (though he played Russian ballet dancer Kolya in The Colbys), however the producers felt that he would appeal to both men and women fans of the franchise. Paul reminded them of a young Sean Connery. Adrian {{said in an interview that}} he was drawn to the series because it had so many layers: history, romance, adventure, spirituality. In an interview he said that he was the very first person to audition for the role in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Family Trade was {{considered}} to be a risk for GSN due to the network's history of airing mostly game shows. Greg Braxton of the Los Angeles Times called the show a [...] "game-changer", and a [...] "key part in [...] strategy to broaden its programming and brand". The day after the series premiere, Michael Tyminski of Manhattan Digest gave a negative review of the show, calling it [...] "incredibly bland", and stating that it appeared to lack much of the family drama that had previously been advertised. Writing for the Star Tribune, Neal Justin added, [...] "The <b>toughest</b> <b>sell</b> of all: Convincing me to watch more than one episode." ...|$|R
2500|$|Acclaimed {{during his}} lifetime, Madetoja is today seldom heard outside the Nordic {{countries}} (the Elegia perhaps excepted). A few commentators, however, have described such neglect as unfortunate and undeserved, as Madetoja {{is one of}} the most important post-Sibelian Finnish symphonists. Part of this neglect is not unique to Madetoja: the titanic legacy of Sibelius has made it difficult for Finnish composers (especially his contemporaries), as a group, to gain much attention, and each has had to labor under his [...] "dominating shadow". However, with respect to the neglect of Madetoja in particular, something else might also be at play: Madetoja's eschewal of Romantic excess in favor of restraint, perhaps, has made him a <b>tougher</b> <b>sell</b> to audiences. According to one music critic: ...|$|R
500|$|Box-office {{analysts and}} critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, {{reasoned}} the film underperformed {{at the box}} office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea [...] "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb". [...] "The horror-comedy genre is the <b>toughest</b> <b>sell</b> in Hollywood", he said. He noted films Tremors, Slither, Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks and The Evil Dead series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, [...] "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can." [...] In addition, he labeled the Scream franchise as more [...] "straight-up horror" [...] than comedy and stated Zombielands box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.|$|R
2500|$|Morton starred as {{a mother}} in the First World War context in Cider with Rosie, a made-for-television {{adaptation}} of the book with the same name by Laurie Lee. The film, described by The Telegraph as a [...] "lyrical, languid and poetic" [...] production, aired on BBC One in September 2015. In the same year, she took on {{a leading role in}} the European limited television series The Last Panthers. The six-part crime drama, inspired by the notorious Balkan jewel thieves the Pink Panthers, saw her play an insurance investigator charged with recovering stolen diamonds whatever the cost. Morton found her character to be a [...] "very truthful, [...] strong woman" [...] and described her as a [...] "female Bond". The show was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK, and on SundanceTV in the US, to generally favourable reviews and moderate attention from viewers. Genevieve Valentine for The AV Club wrote: [...] "Morton might at first seem a <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> as someone so hard-boiled, but the taciturn, untouchable edifice she presents is leaking just enough poison at the edges that we look forward to watching her strike—the sort of character a six-hour miniseries was made for".|$|E

Their generational quartet is [...] "just too wooden" [...] and [...] "just too neat," [...] says one Yale historian. [...] "Prediction is for prophets," [...] scoffed William McLoughlin (a former history professor at Brown), who said it is wrong to think that [...] "if you put enough data together and have enough charts and graphs, you've made history into a science."

5000|$|According to Variety, {{films in}} 3D {{accumulated}} $1.3 billion in 2009, [...] "a threefold increase over 2008 {{and more than}} 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross". The increased ticket price - an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets - helped the film. Likewise, Entertainment Weekly attributed the film's success to 3D glasses, but also to its [...] "astronomic word-of-mouth". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but [...] "the buzz" [...] created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings. Gray said Avatar having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. [...] "The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes," [...] he said, [...] "but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: Titanic (historical events), the Star Wars movies (an established film franchise), or The Lord of the Rings (literature).

50|$|Horror games had {{traditionally}} been a <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> in the RPG industry, but Vampire included elements {{that made it}} a dark superhero game rather than purely a horror game. An extensive list of broad supernatural powers, called disciplines, which included superior strength, speed and toughness, {{as well as other}} powers such as mystic senses, mind control and blood magic, gave the player characters a more super-human rather than horror feel. The 13 clans added late in the development process provided a much needed character-class-like system based on vampiric archetypes which proved very popular with players.|$|E

5000|$|Less {{positive}} about the series, Jim Werner from Weird Science described it as [...] "good at its best and awful {{for the rest of}} the time" [...] in his reviews, calling Orlandos dialogue [...] "close to laughable" [...] and Midnighter [...] "a <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> as a character." [...] Midnighters constant artist changes during its run were also criticised by some critics. The Rainbow Hubs Sam Riedel wrote [...] "it’s better in my mind to establish a series’ aesthetic before switching up art duties", while Jarrod Jones of Doom Rocket declared that [...] "Midnighter is too good to settle for menial sequentials", and added [...] "For a book like this, DC would do well to roll out the red carpet for its best and brightest." ...|$|E
50|$|NFL Network {{has insisted}} that it be placed on basic tiers of {{participating}} providers and wishes to charge the cable companies a monthly rate of $0.61 per subscriber, while Time Warner Cable and other major cable providers wish to place it on a sports tier.
