40|$|Thixoforging {{is a type}} of {{semi-solid}} {{metal processing}} at high solid fraction (0. 7 <fs< 1), which involves the processing of alloys in the semi-solid state. Tooling has to be adapted to this particular process to benefit of shear thinning and thixotropic behaviour of such semisolid material. Tooling parameters, as the forming speed and tool temperature, have to be accurately controlled because of their influence on <b>thermal</b> <b>exchanges</b> between material flow and tool. These <b>thermal</b> <b>exchanges</b> influence the high-cracking tendency and the rheology of the semisolid material during forming which affect parts properties. This paper shows, thanks to extrusion tests, how <b>thermal</b> <b>exchanges</b> influence surface quality of thixoforged parts made in 7075 aluminium alloys at high solid fraction by modifying process parameters like forming speed, tool temperature and tool thermal protector. A direct application is the evaluation of surface quality of thixoforged thin wall parts made in 7075 aluminium alloys. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The International Space Station {{was mainly}} thought as an {{orbiting}} research laboratory and, as such, it comprises several resources to test and validate {{new technologies to}} be used in future space missions. This paper presents the design and development of <b>Thermal</b> <b>Exchange,</b> a microgravity experiment that aims at on-orbit validation of low-toxicity heat pipe performance for thermal control of future spacecraft, both manned and unmanned. Tendency for future space systems points towards simplicity, limited maintenance needs and high reliability. In particular, vehicle thermal control should be based on passive systems, requiring low maintenance and very limited remote control. Accordingly, heat-pipes are good candidates for future spacecraft thermal control, due to their low complexity and maintenance requirement, as well as their high reliability. In this scenario, <b>Thermal</b> <b>Exchange</b> aims at the development of a payload for the demonstration, in microgravity conditions, of heat pipes and low toxicity working fluids, which would make it compatible with human applications (habitable modules) as well. <b>Thermal</b> <b>Exchange</b> is a sub-rack payload that will be operated inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) on-board the International Space Station (ISS). <b>Thermal</b> <b>Exchange</b> consists of a main housing that accommodates the experiment and the avionics containers: the experiment container includes four axially grooved heat pipes filled with low-toxicity working fluids and mixtures, whereas the avionics container encloses three electronic boards to perform power management and distribution, health management and on-board data handling autonomously once on-board the ISS. <b>Thermal</b> <b>Exchange</b> will be launched with the Space-X 9 launch vehicle inside a half CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag). <b>Thermal</b> <b>Exchange</b> will be uninstalled and stowed {{at the end of the}} on-orbit operations and will re-enter with the Space-X 10 vehicle.

40|$|Squamates use the {{circulatory system}} to {{regulate}} body and head temperatures during both heating and cooling. The flexibility of this system, which possibly exceeds that of endotherms, offers {{a number of}} physiological mechanisms to gain or retain heat (e. g., increase peripheral blood flow and heart rate, cooling the head to prolong basking time for the body) {{as well as to}} shed heat (modulate peripheral blood flow, expose sites of <b>thermal</b> <b>exchange).</b> Squamates also have the ability to establish and maintain the same head-to-body temperature differential that birds, crocodilians, and mammals demonstrate, but without a discrete rete or other vascular physiological device. Squamates offer important anatomical and phylogenetic evidence for the inference of the blood vessels of dinosaurs and other extinct archosaurs in that they shed light on the basal diapsid condition. Given this basal positioning, squamates likewise inform and constrain the range of physiological thermoregulatory mechanisms that may have been found in Dinosauria. Unfortunately, the literature on squamate vascular anatomy is limited. Cephalic vascular anatomy of green iguanas (Iguana iguana) was investigated using a differential-contrast, dual-vascular injection (DCDVI) technique and high-resolution X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT). Blood vessels were digitally segmented to create a surface representation of vascular pathways. Known sites of <b>thermal</b> <b>exchange,</b> consisting of the oral, nasal, and orbital regions, were given special attention due to their role in brain and cephalic thermoregulation. Blood vessels to and from sites of <b>thermal</b> <b>exchange</b> were investigated to detect conserved vascular patterns and to assess their ability to deliver cooled blood to the dural venous sinuses. Arteries within sites of <b>thermal</b> <b>exchange</b> were found to deliver blood directly and through collateral pathways. The venous drainage was found to have multiple pathways that could influence neurosensory tissue temperature, as well as pathways that would bypass neurosensory tissues. The orbital region houses a large venous sinus that receives cooled blood from the nasal region. Blood vessels from the nasal region and orbital sinus show anastomotic connections to the dural sinus system, allowing for the direct modulation of brain temperatures. The generality of the vascular patterns discovered in iguanas were assessed by firsthand comparison with other squamates taxa (e. g., via dissection and osteological study) as well as the literature. Similar to extant archosaurs, iguanas and other squamates have highly vascularized sites of <b>thermal</b> <b>exchange</b> that likely support physiological thermoregulation that "fine tunes" temperatures attained through behavioral thermoregulation...|$|R
