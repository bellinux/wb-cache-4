5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash {{performed}} his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking out before the three count. This led to Nash hitting Joe in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and placing {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage in his winning pin attempt.|$|E
5|$|A Mixed Tag Team {{match between}} {{the team of}} Michael Shane and Trinity and the team of Chris Sabin and Traci was held next. The match lasted ten minutes and {{nineteen}} seconds. In the final moments of the bout, Traci hit Sabin in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and Shane kicked Trinity in the face, which allowed Shane to gain the pinfall on Sabin. After Traci and Shane betrayed their partners, they united an alliance of their own.|$|E
5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E

50|$|By 1797 {{the roof}} of the chapel was {{described}} as being partly fallen in. In 1800 William Morton Pitt, the owner of Encombe, a neighbouring farm, became interested in repairing the chapel, and may have carried out minor repairs. He sold Encombe in 1807 to the 1st Earl of Eldon (1751-1838) who also purchased Renscombe in 1811. By this time the chapel roof was described as being overgrown in grass, and with parts of <b>the</b> <b>groins</b> collapsed. Eldon ordered the repair of <b>the</b> <b>groins,</b> but it appears that no major repairs were carried out.|$|R

5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to <b>the</b> <b>groin.</b> This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards <b>the</b> <b>groin.</b> Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|In game five of {{the second}} round of the 2010 playoffs, Salo was hit in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> by a slapshot from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith. Needing to be helped off the ice, he was taken to {{hospital}} with what was falsely believed to be a ruptured testicle. He played through an undisclosed injury the following game, as the Canucks were eliminated by the Blackhawks by a 5–1 score. He completed the playoffs with a goal and six points in 12 post-season games.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} conduoted in a {{straight}} reach of rectangular channel to determ 1 ne the dynamic equilibrium depth of scour associated with submerged constrictions or groins. Tests were carried out with various groin geometries in both rigid- and movable-bed models. Velocity traverses were made over <b>the</b> <b>groins</b> and in <b>the</b> constricted region to establish {{the relationship between the}} ratio of discharge through the constriction to the total discharge and <b>the</b> relative <b>groin</b> submergence and geometry. Measurements of the eroded bed profile in the constricted region indicated that the equilibrium relative depth of scour was related primarily to the discharge ratio and the constriction ratio. All groin geometries tested demonstrated the capability of providing relatively large scour depths at low stages, and less scour depths at high stages for which a larger portion of the total discharge passed over <b>the</b> <b>groins.</b> Reasonable agreement with predicted relative scour depths was noted for relatively large sediment transport rates.

5|$|In {{his early}} years with the Steelers, Greene was at times uncontrollable, and often let his temper {{get the best of}} him. On one {{occasion}} during a 1975 game against the rival Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Greene repeatedly kicked Browns lineman Bob McKay in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> while McKay was lying on the ground. He also punched Denver Broncos guard Paul Howard and spat at quarterback Fran Tarkenton, and he frequently clashed with officials.|$|E
5|$|The semifinals {{were held}} on the September 2 episode of Impact!. Shelley and Waltman {{defeated}} the team of Hoyt and Konnan in the first semifinal match at 4 minutes and 22 seconds. During the match, Hoyt hit Waltman with a boot to the face and went for the pin, but the referee was distracted by Kip James who came down to ringside. Hoyt went to get the referee, giving Waltman the ability to hit him in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and follow-up by slamming him face-first into the mat with his signature X-Factor maneuver.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the eighth series, Kryten's nanobots reconstruct the Red Dwarf, which they had broken down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship – including a pre-accident Rimmer – are resurrected, but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig (at first, for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten and Cat as stowaways, but later for using information from the confidential files). The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on Red Dwarf. The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (and promptly knees him in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and flees).|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{recurrent}} deep venous thrombosis in a 44 -year-old woman, intravenous drug user and HIV-infected, who injected cocaine in <b>the</b> <b>groins</b> and veins of the dorsum of the feet. She suffered several episodes of deep venous thrombosis and soft-tissue infections in the lower limbs. Images of Doppler ultrasound scan revealed thrombosis in the right popliteal vein with partial recanalization and calcified thrombi in {{the territory of the}} right femoral vein. After use of heparin and oral anticoagulation, her clinical evolution was uneventful, and she was asymptomatic at the occasion of the hospital discharge. This report calls for better awareness about injections in <b>the</b> <b>groins</b> and superficial femoral veins, which are part of the deep venous system.

5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and thighs.|$|E
5|$|In the show's fifth match, Randy Orton {{defended his}} World Heavyweight Championship against Christian, with the {{condition}} that Christian would win the title if Orton were disqualified or if there were poor officiating. Christian opened the bout by bringing a steel chair into the ring and trying to goad Orton into getting disqualified. Orton balked and threw the chair to the floor. Christian performed his signature Killswitch, but Orton {{kicked out of the}} pin at the two count. As Orton was prepared to perform his signature RKO move, Christian spat in his face. An enraged Orton kicked Christian in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and was disqualified, so Christian became the new champion. Afterwards, Orton twice slammed Christian's face into the announcers' table with his RKO maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Most {{primates}} {{have two}} mammary glands, {{but the number}} and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are followed by}} a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in <b>the</b> <b>groin)</b> for over three to six months.|$|E
5|$|After WrestleMania 32, on the April 4, 2016 {{episode of}} Raw, Ziggler {{went to a}} double countout with Baron Corbin, leading to Corbin hitting an End of Days outside of the ring to Ziggler, igniting a feud in the process. At the Payback pre-show, Ziggler faced Baron Corbin in a winning effort. The two then had a no {{disqualification}} match at Extreme Rules where Corbin won after hitting a low blow on Ziggler. Following Extreme Rules, on the May 23 episode of Raw, Ziggler had a confrontation backstage with Corbin and challenged him to a technical wrestling match the next week. In that match, Ziggler intentionally got himself disqualified when he kicked Corbin in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> immediately after the match began. This led to a rubber match at Money in the Bank, which Corbin won to end their feud.|$|E
5|$|For {{two weeks}} early in Paul's sophomore season, Wake Forest was ranked {{number one in}} the nation {{for the first time in}} school history. In the final game of the year, Paul punched NC State guard Julius Hodge in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and {{received}} a one-game suspension for the ACC Tournament, an incident that marred Paul's image for a short time. The Demon Deacons again qualified for the NCAA Tournament but suffered a second round upset at the hands of West Virginia. With final averages of 15.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, Paul was eventually named First Team Consensus All-America, and with a 3.21 grade point average (GPA), he was also named to ESPN's Academic All-America Team. On April 15, 2005, he announced he would be hiring an agent and turning professional. On March 2, 2011, Wake Forest retired his jersey.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{management}} of penile cancer has evolved as less invasive techniques are {{applied in the}} treatment of the primary tumor and inguinal lymph nodes. Materials and Methods: Herein we review the literature focusing on advances in the preservation of the phallus as well as less morbid procedures to evaluate and treat <b>the</b> <b>groins.</b> Results: Promising imaging modalities for staging are discussed. New techniques are described and tables provided for penile preservation. We also review the contemporary morbidity of modified surgical forms for evaluation of the inguinal nodes. Conclusions: Advances in surgical technique have made phallic preservation possible in a greater number of primary penile cancers. <b>The</b> <b>groins</b> can be evaluated for metastasis with greater accuracy through new radiologic means as well as with less morbid modified surgical techniques.

40|$|Objectives:To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that oral ciprofloxacin is equally effective as intravenous cefuroxime in preventing postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing peripheral arterial surgery involving <b>the</b> <b>groins.</b> Design:Prospective, randomised, double-blind multicentre study. Materials: 580 patients undergoing arterial surgery involving <b>the</b> <b>groins</b> were randomised to ciprofloxacin (Ciproxin, Bayer) 750 mg × 2 p. o. or cefuroxime (Zinacef, Glaxo) 1. 5 g × 3 i. v. given only {{on the day of}} surgery. The primary endpoint was wound/graft infection within 30 days postoperatively. Wound infection was defined as pus. Results:The wound infection rate in the ciprofloxacin group was 9. 2 % (27 patients) and in the cefuroxime group 9. 1 % (26 patients) according to intention to treat. For correct treatment the corresponding numbers were 9. 5 % (23 patients) and 9. 7 % (22 patients), respectively. There were three graft infections (0. 5 %). The infection rate was 7. 1 % (31 / 433) in the absence and 14. 9 % (22 / 147) in the presence of distal ulcers (p< 0. 05). S. allreus was the most common bacteria isolated. Forty percent of the wound infections were localised to <b>the</b> <b>groins.</b> By multivariate analysis presence of distal ulcer was the only factor of prognostic significance. Conclusions:The infection rate was similar in the two groups. Thus, oral administration of ciprofloxacin is an attractive, cost-effective and safe alternative to prophylaxis in vascular patients capable of taking oral medication on the day of surgery...|$|R
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–1997 NBA season, Rodman won {{his sixth}} {{rebounding}} title {{in a row}} with 16.7boards per game, along with 5.7points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up. However, he made more headlines for his notorious behavior. On January 15, 1997, {{he was involved in}} an incident during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in <b>the</b> <b>groin.</b> Though he was not assessed a technical foul at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000settlement, and the league suspended Rodman for 11games without pay. Thus, he effectively lost $1 million. Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as effective in the 1997 NBA Playoffs, in which the Bulls reached the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. He struggled to slow down Jazz power forward Karl Malone, but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.|$|E

Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by <b>the</b> <b>groin</b> injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 {{it was reported that}} he was nearly recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.|$|E
