However, Gifford's plan begins to unfold when Andra refuses to accept {{the evidence}}, not believing that Anderson is capable of such a heinous crime. When Gifford understands <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's feelings for Anderson, he writes a note confessing to the murder, and then commits suicide.|$|E
25|$|Margaret's long-absent brother, Frederick (who {{is wanted}} for naval mutiny), {{secretly}} visits their dying mother. Thornton sees Margaret and Frederick together, and assumes {{that he is}} her lover. Leonards, a man from Helstone, later recognises Frederick at the train station. They argue; Frederick pushes Leonards away, and Leonards dies shortly afterwards. When the police question Margaret about the scuffle she lies and says she was not present. As the magistrate investigate Leonards' death, Thornton knows that Margaret lied but declares the case closed to save her from possible perjury. Margaret is humbled by his deed on her behalf; she no longer only looks down on Thornton as a hard master, and begins to recognise <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character.|$|E
25|$|Progressively {{it becomes}} obvious that Bret {{was once an}} awkward, science-minded kid who brutally {{repressed}} everything authentic about himself in order to fit in. Now he goes {{through the motions of}} a hollow existence, unable to admit even to himself <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> misery. As his certainties unravel, the night does as well. A fraternity prank goes wrong and propels Bret from his comfort zone into a cross-campus adventure, where he discovers devastating truths about the house president he once idolized. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that the school and society are moving beyond the values that Bret has built his life around: while tech careers have become the hope for a dawning Information Age, his fraternity is a hated and secretly bankrupt enclave slated for demolition. With the help of a beautiful but troubled girl named Caitlin, Bret finds the strength to take a last-ditch stand in an attempt to redeem himself from years of mistakesbefore it becomes too late.|$|E

Whatsername attempts to talk about Johnny's behavior, while the Extraordinary Girl dresses Tunny's wounds and Will sits on the couch, once again alone ("21 Guns"). Johnny leaves a note for Whatsername, saying he has chosen Jimmy and drugs over her. Frightened and fed up, Whatsername tells Johnny {{that he is not}} the [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] and reveals that St. Jimmy is nothing more than [...] "a figment of [...] father's rage and [...] mother's love" [...] ("Letterbomb").

500|$|Keyser Söze's semi-mythical {{nature was}} {{inspired}} by Yuri, a rumored KGB mole whose existence nobody can confirm, from the spy thriller No Way Out. Kint was not originally written to be as obviously intelligent; in the script, he was, according to McQuarrie, [...] "presented as a dummy". Spacey and Singer had previously met at a screening for Public Access. Spacey requested a role in Singer's next film, and McQuarrie wrote the role of Kint specifically for him. McQuarrie said he wanted audiences to dismiss Kint as a minor character, as Spacey was not yet well-known. Spacey made it more obvious that the character is holding back information, though <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> involvement and nature of his secrets remain unrevealed. McQuarrie said that he approved of the changes, as it makes the character [...] "more fascinating".|$|E
500|$|Bowie's {{songs and}} stagecraft {{brought a new}} {{dimension}} to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were [...] "noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance", biographer David Buckley wrote that [...] "Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation." [...] Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, [...] "There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie". Musicologist James Perone credited him with having [...] "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked on <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pervasive artistry that he had lived his life [...] "as though he were an art installation." ...|$|E

500|$|According to The Globe and Mail John Barber, Martin manages {{simultaneously}} to master and transcend the genre so that [...] "Critics applaud <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> characterizations {{and lack of}} cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons". Publishers Weekly gave favorable reviews to the first three Ice and Fire novels at their points of release, saying that A Game of Thrones had [...] "superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness", that A Clash of Kings was [...] "notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [...] for the comparatively modest role of magic", and that A Storm of Swords was one [...] "of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy". However, they found that A Feast For Crows as the fourth installment [...] "sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying." [...] Their review for A Dance with Dragons repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although [...] "The new volume has a similar feel to Feast", [...] "Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [...] notably absent from the previous book." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later {{newspaper}} account {{described him as}} an outstanding outfielder who was [...] "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was [...] "the first centerfielder to {{take his eyes off}} a fly ball, run to the spot where it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of [...]253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was [...]284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. Further research is required to determine <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> involvement in politics.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Hofstadter (6 August 1916 – 24 October 1970) was an American {{historian}} and public intellectual of the mid-20th century. Hofstadter was the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History at Columbia University. Rejecting his earlier approach to {{history from the}} far left, in the 1950s he embraced consensus history, becoming the [...] "iconic historian of postwar liberal consensus", largely because of his emphasis on ideas and political culture rather than the day-to-day doings of politicians.

2500|$|Eric Samuel Heffer (12 January 1922 – 27 May 1991) was a British socialist politician. He was Labour Member of Parliament for Liverpool Walton from 1964 {{until his}} death.

Due to {{his experience as a}} professional joiner, he made a speciality of the construction industry and its employment practices, but was also concerned with trade union issues in general. He changed his view on the European Common Market from being an outspoken supporter to an outspoken opponent, and served a brief period in government in the mid-1970s. His later career was dominated by his contribution to debates within the Labour Party and he defended the far left-dominated Liverpool City Council.|$|E
2500|$|Theologian Dale Allison {{views the}} concept of [...] "words falling short" [...] in these lyrics as central to [...] "That Is All" [...] and a {{recurring}} theme in Harrison's songwriting. Allison also notes the importance of silence in this and other Harrison song lyrics, where it becomes [...] "not an enemy to be shunned but... a friend to be embraced, for silence can help conduct us to the Divine". On release, part of the middle eight's lyrics, together with those for the final verse, were identified by music critic Stephen Holden as [...] "a sort of Hindu In Paradisium". While he considers [...] "That Is All" [...] to be a secular, [...] "adult-oriented" [...] love song, Inglis writes of Harrison's message in the middle eight: [...] "language is insufficient to express <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> emotion; 'silence' can be more effective, more intimate, more loving." ...|$|E
