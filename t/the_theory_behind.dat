25|$|Dantzig's {{original}} {{example was}} {{to find the best}} assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the observable universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the simplex algorithm. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>behind</b> linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible solutions that must be checked.|$|E

25|$|Vehicles {{in orbit}} have {{large amounts of}} kinetic energy. This energy must be {{discarded}} if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>behind</b> reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle and the heat energy instead {{ends up in the}} atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|While SNAP {{participants}} and other low-income nonparticipants spend similar amounts on food spending, SNAP participants tend to still experience greater food insecurity than nonparticipants. This {{is believed to}} be a reflection of welfare of individuals who take the time to apply for SNAP benefits than the shortcomings of SNAP. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>behind</b> this is that those households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear of the burden of applying for program benefits. Therefore, SNAP participants tend to be, on average, less food secure than other low-income nonparticipants.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, the fortifications can be {{built up}} at a series of sites, such as castles or forts placed near a border. These {{structures}} are designed to delay an invasion {{long enough for the}} defending nation to mobilize an army of size sufficient for defense or, in some cases, counter-invasion—such as, for example, the Maginot Line. Forts can be positioned so that the garrisons can interdict the supply lines of the invaders. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>behind</b> these spaced forts is that the invader cannot afford to bypass these defenses, and so must lay siege to the structures.|$|E
25|$|The first {{effort was}} the {{creation}} of the London Gold Pool on 1 November 1961 between eight nations. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>behind</b> the pool was that spikes in the free market price of gold, set by the morning gold fix in London, could be controlled by having a pool of gold to sell on the open market, that would then be recovered when the price of gold dropped. Gold's price spiked in response to events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, and other smaller events, to as high as $40/ounce. The Kennedy administration drafted a radical change of the tax system to spur more production capacity and thus encourage exports. This culminated with the 1963 tax cut program, designed to maintain the $35 peg.|$|E
