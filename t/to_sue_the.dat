Marsiyem's lawyers from the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan Hukum) filed a case in January 1997 against the police (national, provincial, and local), and Edy Wuryanto. The lawsuit demanded Rp. 1 million (US$36,400) in damages. The police countered that the blood had been given voluntarily, and that Marsiyem hoped to exploit the situation.|$|E

5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife and two}} daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E
5|$|Natasha {{models for}} a PirateNet {{advertising}} campaign, where she meets Andrew Robinson and Summer Hoyland.

He threatens <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> station owner and Andrew's father, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Natasha and Andrew work together to change the posters, so {{they are no longer}} revealing. They then attend a concert together and kiss {{at the end of the}} night. Natasha clashes with Summer and starts a rumour that her boyfriend, Chris Pappas (James Mason), bought the basketball team captaincy. Her relationship with her father is strained further when he learns she started the rumour. The schools English teacher, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), discovers Natasha is hiding her maths skills and makes her join the Mathletes as a punishment. Natasha wonders if Andrew is only with her because of her looks and she becomes insecure about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but may be able <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September, the {{surviving}} relatives of each decedent received 2 million Russian rubles (about US$40,000) {{for each person}} {{who died in the}} accident. Ukrainian relatives stated to Norwegian media that they had not received information about the cause and other issues surrounding the accident. At the time, Ukraine was experiencing very high unemployment, and Arktikugol offered wages many times what was then offered in mainland Ukraine. Many miners not only had to support their immediate family, but also relatives. Vnukovo Airlines stated on Ukrainian television that the relatives would receive US$20,000 per deceased person. About a year after the accident, all relatives had been offered US$20,000, but about two-thirds of them chose not to accept the amount, and instead started a process <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> insurance company. Their lawyer, Gunnar Nerdrum, stated that according to both Norwegian and Russian law, they could demand at least US$140,000.|$|E
5|$|The Café Royal, {{located at}} 68 Regent Street in the Quadrant, was opened in 1865 by Daniel Nicols {{and became an}} {{institution}} of London high society.

5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|In 1320 King Edward II of England confiscated the lordship of Gower on {{the grounds}} that Braose had given it to his {{son-in-law}} Mowbray without royal permission. Over the preceding years Braose had promised Gower to a number of persons, including Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Mowbray then in late 1319 took custody of Gower to protect his rights. Despenser persuaded the king in 1320 to take Gower into royal hands in October, and was appointed keeper of the honour in November. The other lords in the Welsh Marches resented this seizure, feeling that the king's excuse for it was not applicable. The seizure was one of the precipitating causes of the baronial rebellion that led to the exile of the Despensers in 1321. In 1322 Gower was given to the younger Despenser again, who then traded it for the honours of Usk and Caerleon. Braose was then induced <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> new holder of Gower for the return of the barony in April 1324, which action succeeded in June 1324. Braose then promptly gave Gower to the elder Despenser, returning the property to the Despenser family once more. The lordship of Gower eventually ended {{up in the hands of}} the Beauchamp family, but it was not until the 1350s that the issue was decided.|$|E

However, moments later Alison suffers a stroke and falls into a coma that she is deemed {{unlikely}} to wake from. As Alison had signed a DNR form, Lexie is forced to turn off the machine keeping her alive, despite Gary begging her to stop. After failing in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>the</b> hospital, a grief-stricken Mr. Clark later returns to the hospital with a gun, seeking revenge on Lexie, Derek and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). After witnessing Mr. Clark shoot a nurse dead, Mark shields Lexie during the shooting and the pair attempt to save a critically wounded Alex. Seeking supplies, Lexie heads out into the hospital and comes face to face with Mr Clark who attempts to shoot her, but she is saved by a SWAT team member who wounds Clark at the last moment allowing her to escape. Lexie and Mark proceed to save Alex's life, but Lexie is disappointed and irritated when a delirious Alex calls for his ex-wife, Izzie, while nearly dying instead of Lexie. After a showdown with Richard, Gary Clark eventually commits suicide, having killed eleven people and wounding another seven, as well as causing Meredith to suffer a miscarriage.|$|E
