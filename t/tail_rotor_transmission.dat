40|$|The {{impact of}} a 7. 62 NATO {{projectile}} on the Al 6061 -T 4 shaft of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission</b> of a helicopter is studied in detail {{in order to identify}} the effect on the residual strength of the component. The investigation is carried out numerically by means of the finite element method, adopting classical von Mises plasticity in conjunction with a detailed experimental characterization of the mechanical behaviour of the material at different strain rates. In order to validate the method, the results of further analyses simulating the impact of projectiles on moving flat targets are compared with previously published experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{describe}} a ballistic tolerant approach to evaluate the decrement of the structural integrity of a section of a helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission</b> shaft, made in A 16061 -T 6 aluminum, impacted by a 7. 62 ball bullet. The focus lies {{on the development of}} a reliable and efficient modelling methodology. Very refined numerical models are used to reduce the experimental efforts and to increase the awareness of the phenomena. Starting from previous work performed by the authors', a numerical model of the impacted shaft is presented and validated by comparison with the results of a large experimental programme. The model is used to assess the variation in the vibration modes and the buckling load caused by the damage. In order to improve the reliability of the model, the mechanical behaviour of the materials of the shaft and of the projectile has been fully considered: flow stress, strain rate, temperature, damage criteria...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the set up}} and the {{carrying}} out of experimental ballistic tests on a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission</b> shafts for helicopter, which are impacted by a 7. 62 NATO projectile, are presented. After the tests, a 3 D acquisition of the impacted area on each shaft has been performed in order to acquire exactly {{the shape of the}} damage. The acquisition has been carried out with a 3 D range camera. The experimental activities have been compared with the results of a numerical simulation of the impact, which has been computed with an explicit finite element code. The direct comparison has been done by superimposing the two meshes (from FE analysis and from 3 D acquisition). This method has proved to be effective for identifying analogies and differences and for giving the possibility to promote a “quantitative” discussion with the aim of improving the accuracy of the numerical models and simulation conditions. The adoption of the Reverse Engineering practice {{has proved to be a}} powerful method for integrating and comparing the simulation data with real data, and give suggestions to further analysis...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to exploit a dedicated material calibration to predict an extreme loading condition: the damage of a helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission</b> shaft due to a small arm ballistic impact. A typical material point in the damage area undergoes to complex stress and strain history, starting from a large compressive stresses through shear deformation during crack extension {{all the way to}} the tensile fracture of the remaining ligament. The plasticity and the fracture characterization require to perform material tests covering the wide range of stress state. Therefore, a part of the paper is devoted to the description and analysis of plasticity and fracture test of different type of specimens. This includes test on round smooth and notched specimens under combined torsion/tension-compression, flat dogbone and a curved tensile specimen cut from the wall of the shaft. The test data have been used to calibrate the phenomenological Modified Mohr-Coulomb model and the empirical Bao-Wierzbicki fracture models. The result of the numerical simulation of the projectile impact was then compared with the experiments on the ballistic impact of 7. 62 ball projectile against the helicopter shaft. A very good agreement was found for both damage shape and residual velocity...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} abnormal discolouration of oil in ADF helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>transmissions</b> has been observed and reported over the last eight years. Aircraft maintainers have initially attributed the discolouration to a range of contamination modes including incorrect fluid addition, hydraulic fluid contamination and degraded fluid. A program of work was conducted at DSTO to identify and characterise the cause of the abnormal discolouration. This report details the identification of a coloured metal quinizarate salt which forms in the aircraft transmissions under normal operating conditions and describes the mechanism of formation and some characteristics of the quinizarate salt to assist in developing maintenance programs to manage the coloured salt when observed in service conditions...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and {{the systems}} that provide {{power and control}} for it are {{considered}} critically important for safe flight. As with many parts on a helicopter, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> its <b>transmission,</b> and many parts in the drive system are often life-limited, meaning they are arbitrarily replaced after {{a certain number of}} flight hours, regardless of condition. Between replacements, parts are subject to frequent inspections utilizing visual as well as chemical methods such as fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect weak parts before they fail completely.|$|R

50|$|Larger {{helicopters}} became {{commercially available}} after the Vietnam War as helicopter manufacturers focused on selling commercial versions of their military aircraft. For instance, Boeing Vertol Model 107 and Model 234 aircraft {{have been used}} to carry even heavier payloads than their lighter predecessors. But the heaviest loads required a pure aerial crane. The answer came from Sikorsky's S-64 Skycrane. Originally produced for the military as the CH-54 Tarhe for heavy lifting of downed aircraft and artillery pieces, the S-64 Skycrane was nothing more than just enough airframe to attach two powerful engines, the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> and <b>transmissions,</b> a cockpit, and a cargo hook and winch system.|$|R
50|$|First, {{there is}} no <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the main rotors are contra-rotating. Yaw is {{controlled}} by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the <b>rotor</b> drive <b>transmission.</b> When one <b>rotor</b> is adjusted to spin slightly faster than the other, it induces yaw (turning motion).|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the tailboom built from carbon fibre. Its 6.10 m diameter two-bladed rotor has a chord of 20 cm, with anti-torque handled by a conventional two-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> The main <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission</b> uses a combination of V-belts and toothed belts. Pitch link controls are mounted inside the hollow rotor mast tube. The aircraft has an empty weight of 193 kg and a gross weight of 386 kg, giving a useful load of 193 kg. With full fuel of 58.8 L the payload is 151 kg.|$|R
50|$|At {{the instant}} of engine failure, the main rotor blades are {{producing}} lift and thrust from their {{angle of attack}} and velocity. By immediately lowering collective pitch, which must be done {{in case of an}} engine failure, the pilot reduces lift and drag and the helicopter begins an immediate descent, producing an upward flow of air through the rotor system. This upward flow of air through the rotor provides sufficient thrust to maintain rotor rotational speed throughout the descent. Since the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is driven by the main <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission</b> during autorotation, heading control is maintained as in normal flight.|$|R
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, <b>transmission,</b> <b>rotor</b> mast, main <b>rotor</b> blades, <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed approximately six times that of the main <b>rotor</b> to increase <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|Variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{speed is}} {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> In hover, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Reducing the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is ineffective for power reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R
40|$|A {{model test}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of aerodynamic interaction between main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and vertical fin on helicopter performance and noise in hover out of ground effect. The experimental data were obtained from hover tests performed with a. 151 scale Model 222 main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and vertical fin. Of primary interest was the effect of location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> with respect to the main rotor. Penalties on main rotor power due to interaction with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> ranged up to 3 % depending upon <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> location and orientation. Penalties on <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power due to fin blockage alone ranged up to 10 % for pusher <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> and up to 50 % for tractor <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> The main rotor wake had only a second order effect on these tail rotor/fin interactions. Design charts are presented showing the penalties on main rotor power as a function of the relative location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{failures}} which occur {{from either}} a mechanical malfunction of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> control system or {{a loss of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust authority, called [...] "loss of tail-rotor effectiveness" [...] (LTE).|$|R
50|$|NOTAR, {{an acronym}} for NO <b>TAil</b> <b>Rotor,</b> is a {{helicopter}} anti-torque system that eliminates {{the use of the}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> on a helicopter. Although the concept took some time to refine, the NOTAR system is simple in theory and provides antitorque the same way a wing develops lift by using the Coandă effect. A variable pitch fan is enclosed in the aft fuselage section immediately forward of the tail boom and is driven by the main <b>rotor</b> <b>transmission.</b> To provide the sideways force to counteract the clockwise torque produced by a counterclockwise-spinning main rotor (as seen from above the main rotor), the variable-pitch fan forces low pressure air through two slots {{on the right side of}} the tailboom, causing the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tailboom, producing lift and thus a measure of antitorque proportional to the amount of airflow from the rotorwash. This is augmented by a direct jet thruster which also provides directional yaw control, with the presence of a fixed-surface empennage near the end of the tail, incorporating vertical stabilizers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{drive system}} {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in forward flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recent {{technology}} in emergency <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> recovery systems has been advanced by the US Army in an SBIR research award to EATTS. The emergency anti-torque thruster system (EATTS) {{would allow a}} helicopter that has encountered <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure, or loss of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness, to land safely. The system is designed to counteract the torque from the helicopter's main <b>rotor</b> system during <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure {{as a result of}} mechanical problems as well as loss of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> from RPG hits.|$|R
50|$|When the {{trailing}} vortices colliding with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are rotating {{in the same}} direction, this causes a loss of thrust from the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> When {{the trailing}} vortices rotate {{in the opposite direction}} of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> thrust is increased. Use of the foot pedals is required to adjust the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor's</b> angle of attack, to compensate for these instabilities.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an ongoing effort {{to model the}} {{interaction}} aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter in subsonic flow are presented. The configurations studied are a) a two-blade main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover, and b) a four-blade main- and a two-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in climb flight. The numerical approach consists of computing the unsteady pressure on the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade surface with a 3 -D unsteady free wake panel method and using this as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equation based aeroacoustic code to evaluate the noise characteristics. Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> axis {{and the sense of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> rotation.

40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a {{helicopter}} with a single main rotor configuration can experience {{a significant reduction in}} thrust when the aircraft operates in crosswind flight. Brown’s vorticity transport model has been used to simulate a main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system translating at a sideslip angle that causes the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to interact with the main rotor tip vortices as they propagate downstream at the lateral extremities of the wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is shown to exhibit a distinct directionally dependent mode during which <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> that are configured so that the blades travel forward {{at the top of the}} disk develop less thrust than <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> with the reverse sense of rotation. The range of flight speeds over which this mode exists is shown to vary considerably with the vertical location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> At low flight speeds, the directionally dependent mode occurs because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within not only the downwash from the main rotor but also the rotational flow associated with clusters of largely disorganized vorticity within the main rotor wake. At higher flight speeds, however, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within a coherent supervortex that strongly influences the velocity field surrounding the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of mass and stiffness imbalance in a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> induced by damage in forward flight. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis based on finite element {{in space and time}} and capable of modeling dissimilar blades is carried out to study the effect of damage occurring in one, two, and three blades in a four-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system in forward flight.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the main rotor tip vortices, and with the fuselage separation mean wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-main rotor tip vortex interaction is modelled as an airfoil of infinite span cutting through a moving vortex. The vortex and the geometry information required by the analyses are obtained through a free wake geometry analysis of the main rotor. The acoustic pressure-time histories for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-vortex interactions are then calculated. These acoustic results are compared to <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> loading and thickness noise, and {{are found to be}} significant to the overall <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise generation. Under most helicopter operating conditions, large acoustic pressure fluctuations can be generated due to a series of skewed main rotor tip vortices passing through the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> disk.

50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{is powered}} by the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed {{proportional}} {{to that of the}} main rotor. In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, the main <b>rotor</b> and the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows the rotors to keep turning {{in the event of an}} engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R

40|$|Balancing is a {{rotating}} component {{is critical in}} any mechanism. Devoid of proper balancing, any vehicle-be it in air, land or sea, it will affect stability, control and safety. The same goes for rotor crafts. Imbalance of the helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system leads to vibrations in the entire vehicle and may cause accident. Typically, for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter, the blade {{is a source of}} vibration on the tail boom.

50|$|Based on {{the success}} of Harbin Z-9 and HC120, fenestron {{configuration}} was originally adopted for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> However, due to the inherent disadvantages of the design, such as higher power requirement, higher construction and maintenance cost, higher resistance and weight, fenestron design was dropped after test flights, and a more conventional <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration was adopted. The 4-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is similar to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of AH-64, with two pairs at unequal distance instead of 4 blades at the equal distance, and one of the main purposes of such arrangement was to reduce noise.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European HeliNOVI project, an acoustic DNW wind tunnel study was conducted into helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise. The goal of the tests was to investigate (1) the importance of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise for different flight conditions (2) main rotor/tail rotor interaction noise, and (3) <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise reduction concepts. Besides the conventional measurement techniques, such as an inflow microphone traverse, blade pressure transducers and PIV, an out-of-flow phased microphone array was applied to locate and quantify the different helicopter noise sources. The test results indicate that <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise is most important for climb and high-speed level flight. Furthermore, it is found that main rotor/tail rotor interactions only have a small effect on the overall noise levels.
