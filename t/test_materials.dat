25|$|When Orfila arrived, {{he insisted}} that the local chemists witness his {{experiments}} that night. He used the same <b>test</b> <b>materials</b> and chemical reagents that they used in the earliest tests and performed the Marsh test in an anteroom of the courthouse, behind locked and guarded doors. At last, {{on the afternoon of}} the next day, Orfila entered the courtroom, followed by the three chemists with bowed heads. He declared that he had indeed found arsenic on the samples taken from the body of Lafarge, to the exclusion of all other extraneous sources, such as arsenic naturally occurring in the body, or from the reagents, or from the arsenic from the earth surrounding the coffin.|$|E
500|$|More {{than just}} the events were changed during the 1998–99 season—the style of study {{required}} of students changed. Prior to that season, students had performed their own research for each event, and test writers {{did not have to}} base their questions on material USAD published. However, after a policy change {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 competition year, test writers were required to base the tests on official USAD materials. After the change in policy, scores vastly increased across the country. That year at Nationals, James E. Taylor High School had the highest team score yet seen at the competition. The following season, USAD once again altered their testing policies; 50% of test questions were to come from USAD published [...] "Resource Guides" [...] and 50% were to come from unspecified sources. Economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for the previous 19 years. A decrease in scores followed these changes; the national winner that year, El Camino Real High School, scored 5,923 fewer points than James E. Taylor High School had the previous year. The following year, USAD settled on an organization of <b>test</b> <b>materials</b> that it would use for almost a full decade, with a mixture of questions from the provided material and independent research. A number of curriculum changes were reversed.|$|E

50|$|Active {{thermography}} is {{an advanced}} nondestructive testing procedure, {{which uses a}} thermography measurement of a <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> thermal response after its external excitation. This principle can be used also for non-contact infrared non-destructive <b>testing</b> (IRNDT) of <b>materials.</b> The IRNDT method {{is based on an}} excitation of a <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> by an external source, which brings some energy to the material. Halogen lamps, flash-lamps, ultrasound generator or other sources can be used as the excitation source for the IRNDT. The excitation causes a <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> thermal response, which is measured by an infrared camera. It is possible to obtain information about the <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> surface and sub-surface defects or material inhomogeneities by using a suitable combination of excitation source, excitation procedure, infrared camera and evaluation method.|$|R
