5|$|Human {{impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> {{resulted}} {{in an increase in}} the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has {{resulted in an}} increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, food waste's {{effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of {{millions}} of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. <b>The</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the common {{definition}} of adaptation, a central concept in evolution, is a trait that was functional to the reproductive {{success of the}} organism and that is thus now present due to being selected for; that is, function and evolution are inseparable. However a trait can have a current function that is adaptive without being an adaptation in this sense, if for instance <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> changed. Imagine {{an environment in which}} having a small body suddenly conferred benefit on an organism when previously body size had had no effect on survival.|$|E
25|$|Larger mammals include {{carnivores}} pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums, and armadillos. Deer {{are plentiful}} in the south, and {{many species of}} New World monkeys {{are found in the}} northern rain forests. Concern for <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> grown in response to global interest in environmental issues. Brazil's Amazon Basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species, including the red-bellied piranha. Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.|$|E
25|$|Postosuchus {{lived in}} a {{tropical}} environment. The moist and warm region consisted of ferns, such as Cynepteris, Phelopteris and Clathropteris, gymnosperms, represented by Pelourdea, Araucarioxylon, Woodworthia, Otozamites and Dinophyton, and cycads like Sanmiguelia. Plants of the Dockum Group are not well known since the oxidizing of <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> destroyed most of the plant fossils. However, {{some of them may}} provide information about the climate in Dockum Group during the late Triassic period. For example, the discovery of large specimens belonging to Araucarioxylon determine that the region was well watered. The fauna found in Dockum Group confirm that there were lakes and/or rivers containing fish such as the cartilaginous Xenacanthus, the lobe-finned Chinlea and the dipnoan Ceratodus. On the shores of these rivers lived labyrinthodonts (Latiscopus) and reptiles such as Malerisaurus and Trilophosaurus. Also living on the margins of the lakes were the archosaurs Leptosuchus, Nicrosaurus and Rutiodon. Postosuchus lived in the uplands along with Coelophysis and other archosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Typothorax. Postosuchus was one of the largest animals in that ecosystem and preyed on herbivores such as Trilophosaurus and Typothorax.|$|E

25|$|The {{most serious}} {{demographic}} imbalance {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E
500|$|Germanium is not {{considered}} essential {{to the health of}} plants or animals. Germanium in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> little or no health impact. [...] This is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and carbonaceous materials, and the various industrial and electronic applications involve very small quantities that {{are not likely to be}} ingested. For similar reasons, end-use germanium has little impact on the environment as a biohazard. Some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous (see precautions, below).|$|E

These problems include inadequate legal landfills {{as well as the}} presence of illegal landfills; between 2005 and 2008, 62 authorized and 423 illegal landfills were rehabilitated. In the same period, the number of issued waste management licenses doubled, while the annual municipal solid waste volume increased by 23%, reaching [...] per capita. The processes of soil acidification and organic matter degradation are present throughout Croatia, with increasing soil salinity levels in the Neretva river plain and spreading areas of alkali soil in Slavonia.|$|E
500|$|Surface {{water flows}} into mines and accumulates along with groundwater. This water must be pumped out {{in order for}} mining to proceed. The water that is pumped from the mines and the coolant water used by oil shale-fired power {{stations}} combined exceeds 90% of all water used in Estonia. For each cubic meter of oil shale mined in Estonia, [...] of water must be pumped from the mines, amounting to about [...] that are pumped from mines annually. Groundwater comprises 64% of the water pumped from underground mines annually and 24% of that pumped from open-pit mines. This alters both the circulation {{and quality of the}} groundwater, lowers groundwater levels, and releases mine water into surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Mining activities have contributed to lower water levels in 24 out of the 39 lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. The release of mine water into <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>has</b> changed the natural movement of surface water.
