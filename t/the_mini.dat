5|$|Like {{the first}} Ridge Racer, the player {{normally}} starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable on winning <b>the</b> <b>mini</b> game before the title screen (<b>the</b> <b>mini</b> game is Galaga '88 {{instead of the}} original game's Galaxian). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications {{are similar to the}} first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E

40|$|Polarity {{dependence}} of the crystal growth rate, evaporation rate and chemical etching behavior of ZnO, CdS and ZnS crystals was investigated. After chemical etching the plus polar surfaces of these crystals show a few pits on them, whereas <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> polar surfaces are deeply etched and become rough. The preferential growth direction of ZnO in the polar direction is the plus polar direction and that of CdS and ZnS is <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> one. In addition, the evaporation rate is larger on the plus polar surface than on <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> one in ZnO and it is larger on <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> polar surface in CdS and ZnS.

5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). <b>The</b> <b>Mini</b> Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and <b>the</b> <b>Mini</b> Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), <b>the</b> <b>mini</b> intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E

On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through <b>the</b> <b>Mini</b> DisplayPort connector.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>minus</b> {{version of}} DTLZ and WFG was {{proposed}} as many-objective test problems with inverted triangular Pareto fronts in [13]. <b>The</b> <b>minus</b> version {{can be easily}} formulated by changing each objective in DTLZ and WFG from f_i(x) to  -f_i(x).

The main feature of <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> DTLZ and WFG test problems is that their Pareto fronts are inverted triangular, whereas the Pareto fronts of DTLZ and WFG are triangular.

5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. <b>The</b> <b>mini</b> and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E
