The Micom 2000 improved on the AES design {{by using the}} Intel 8080 single-chip microprocessor, which made <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> smaller, less costly to build and supported multiple languages.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} SpeedScript for MS-DOS {{was created in}} 1988 by Randy Thompson and {{published}} in book form by Compute! Books. This version was written in Turbo Pascal with portions written in assembly language, and added incremental new features to <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> such as additional printer commands, full cursor-control (to {{take advantage of the}} PC's Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn keys), and a native 80-column mode.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> was a {{stand-alone}} office {{machine in the}} 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a recording unit, either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, word processors typically featured a monochrome display {{and the ability to}} save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.|$|E

25|$|While {{many homes}} have word {{processors}} on their computers, word processing {{in the home}} tends to be educational, planning or business related, dealing with school assignments or work being completed at home. Occasionally word processors are used for recreational purposes, e.g. writing short stories, poems or personal correspondence. Some use word processors to create résumés and greeting cards, {{but many of these}} home publishing processes have been taken over by web apps or desktop publishing programs specifically oriented toward home uses. The rise of email and social networks has also reduced the home role of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> as uses that formerly required printed output can now be done entirely online.|$|E
25|$|In April 1983 Compute! {{published}} Scriptor, a {{word processor}} written by staff writer Charles Brannon in BASIC and assembly language, as a type-in program for the Atari 8-bit family. In January 1984 version 1.0 of his new word processor SpeedScript appeared in Compute!'s Gazette for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. 1.1 appeared in Compute!'s Second Book of Commodore 64, 2.0 on Gazette Disk in May 1984, and 3.0 in Compute! in March and April 1985. Corrections that updated 3.0 to 3.1 appeared in May 1985, and the full version appeared in a book published by Compute!, SpeedScript: <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>Processor</b> for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. A 3.2 update appeared in the December 1985 Compute! and January 1986 Compute! Disk and again later in the May 1987 Compute!'s Gazette issue with three additional utilities.|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft Word {{is a word}} {{processor}} which possesses a dominant market share in <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> market.

2500|$|Correction fluid is an opaque, white fluid {{applied to}} paper to mask errors in text. It was very {{important}} when material was typed with a typewriter, but has become less so {{since the advent of}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor.</b> Correction fluid was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951. Originally called by the brand name [...] "Mistake Out", Graham began selling correction fluid in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|Wang {{wanted to}} compete against IBM as a {{computer}} company, selling directly to Management Information System departments. Before the VS, however, Wang Laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company. The calculators, word processing systems and OIS were sold into individual departments, bypassing the corporate data-processing decision-makers. The chapter in Wang's book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as [...] "a beachhead in the Fortune 1000." [...] The Wang VS was Wang's entrée into IT departments. In his book, An Wang notes that, to sell the VS, [...] "we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing... who had experience dealing with MIS executives, and who knew their way around Fortune 1000 companies." [...] As the VS took hold, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> and OIS lines were phased out. The word processing software continued, {{in the form of}} a loadable-microcode environment that allowed VS workstations to take on the behavior of traditional Wang WP terminals to operate with the VS and use it as a document server.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s IBM {{introduced}} a Selectric III {{and several other}} Selectric models, some of them word processors or typesetters instead of typewriters, but by {{then the rest of}} the industry had caught up with the trend, and IBM's new models did not dominate the market the way the first Selectric had. This was to be expected, as by the late 1970s the Selectric typewriter's dominance was under assault from both 35-45 character per second proportional-spacing electronic typewriters with inbuilt memory (e.g. the 800 from Xerox based on Diablo's [...] "daisywheels" [...] and from OEMs of Qume who had a similar printwheel technology) and CRT-based systems from AES, Lexitron, Vydek, Wang and Xerox (see <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>Processor</b> article for further details of these brands). In addition, IBM had already (c. 1977) brought to market the CRT-based Office System/6 (from Office Products Division) and 5520 [...] (from IBM General Systems Division (GSD)) both of which used the new 6640 inkjet printer capable of 96 characters per second with two paper trays and sophisticated envelope handling, and was about to introduce Qume-based printers for the existing System/6 range and the new Displaywriter launched in June 1980 and described by IBM as [...] "not your father's Selectric." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> on Mini Office II {{allows the}} user, after having loaded <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> {{and created a}} word file and saved it, to load the word file {{directly}} from the tape without re-loading <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor.</b> If the user has a word file on tape it therefore loads in about three seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{top-level}} specification is a Stream X-Machine {{describing the}} main user {{interaction with the}} system. For example, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> will exist {{in a number of}} states, in which keystrokes and commands will have different effects. Suppose that this word processor exists in the states {Writing, Selecting, Filing, Editing}. We expect <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> to start in the initial Writing state, but to move to the Selecting state if either the mouse is dragged, or the shift-key is held down. Once the selection is established, it should return to the Writing state. Likewise, if a menu option is chosen, this should enter the Editing or Filing state. In these states, certain keystrokes may have different meanings. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> eventually returns to the Writing state, when any menu command has finished. This state machine is designed and labelled informally with the various actions that cause it to change state.|$|E

50|$|For example: a user might first {{instruct}} {{the operating system}} to load a word processor program from one file, and then edit a document stored in another file with <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> program. In this example, the document would be considered data. If <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> also features a spell checker, then the dictionary (word list) for the spell checker would also be considered data. The algorithms used by the spell checker to suggest corrections would be either machine code data or text in some interpretable programming language.|$|E
