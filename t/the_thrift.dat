25|$|As Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Thrift</b> Investment Board, he was {{responsible}} for overseeing <b>the</b> <b>Thrift</b> Savings Plan (TSP) which is the retirement savings account for employees of the Federal Government and soldiers of the armed services. The TSP is known to reap higher returns for their retirement than comparable private-sector workers, and is immune from many of the problems that plague mutual funds. During Saul's tenure, the TSP was grown to over $200 billion in assets by 2007, making it twice as large as when he began in 2003. He also cut operating expenses by over $20 million. The TSP is the largest defined contribution plan in the world with over 3.7 million participants and assets worth over $210 billion. The plan is expected to grow to at least $300 billion by 2010.|$|E

IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a [...] "run" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>thrift</b> following the public release of the letter.

2500|$|With that in mind, Congress finally {{acted on}} deregulating <b>the</b> <b>thrift</b> industry. It passed two laws, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982. The {{deregulation}} not only allowed thrifts {{to offer a}} wider array of savings products (including adjustable rate mortgages, which fixed one important problem), but also significantly expanded their lending authority and reduced regulatory oversight. These changes were intended to allow S to [...] "grow" [...] out of their problems, and as such represented {{the first time that}} the government explicitly sought to influence S profits as opposed to promoting housing and homeownership. Other changes in thrift oversight included authorizing the use of more lenient accounting rules to report their financial condition, and the elimination of restrictions on the minimum numbers of S stockholders. Such policies, combined with an overall decline in regulatory oversight (known as forbearance), would later be cited as factors in the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>thrift</b> industry.|$|E
2500|$|His largest {{accomplishment}} with <b>the</b> <b>Thrift</b> Savings Board was {{to eliminate}} open enrollment periods, which allows eligible participants to enroll year-round, and {{the launch of}} lifecycle funds, which automatically allocate investments to minimize risk as a federal employee nears retirement. During monthly FRTIB board meetings, Saul pushed for improvements in technology and customer service, and was instrumental in having the board hire an outside auditor to review TSP financial statements and bring any concerns directly to the board rather than to TSP staff. He is {{required by law to}} be independent and act {{in the best interests of}} plan participants. As chairman, Saul urged the board to send a signal to Congress that <b>the</b> <b>Thrift</b> Savings Plan cannot be drawn into social or political debates, even for good causes. He also opposed so-called [...] "terror-free" [...] investments which would divest the plan from holdings in any government designated by the State Department as a terrorist-sponsoring state, or in businesses with substantial investments in those nations.

2500|$|In 1980, the United States Congress granted all thrifts, {{including}} {{savings and}} loan associations, {{the power to make}} consumer and commercial loans and to issue transaction accounts.
