5|$|In 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa, Agneta Matthes found {{a letter}} from Maria Eringaard {{requesting}} the child support that he owed for their children, which led to Matthes discovering <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, {{and that he had}} four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did not tell van Markem that she knew about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.|$|E
5|$|With investigatory focus {{turned to}} Stella Nickell, detectives {{uncovered}} more circumstantial evidence pointing {{to her as}} the culprit. Nickell had taken out {{a total of about}} $76,000 in insurance coverage on her husband's life, with an additional payout of $100,000 if his death was accidental. She was also known to have, even before Susan Snow's death, repeatedly disputed doctors' ruling <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> died of natural causes. Further FBI investigation showed that Bruce Nickell's purported signatures on {{at least two of the}} insurance policies in his name had been forged.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the claimant (as a practical joke) <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and {{was thought to be}} suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 2008, Ice {{was arrested}} in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife. He was released the following day after she declared <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. Ice was ordered by a Florida court {{to stay away from}} his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E
5|$|Ho Yuen Hoe {{was born}} on 18 February 1908, to a family of silk weavers in Guangzhou, China, the second of three children. Her family was poor, and she was sold when she was five years old. Barely two years later, the {{spinster}} who had purchased her died, and Ho was sold by the woman's nephew, to become a maid. After a few years she was sold again. In her late teens, a group of snakeheads persuaded her and several other girls to emigrate to Singapore, ostensibly {{to work on a}} rubber plantation, but the job did not materialise. At the age of 21, alone and penniless, she married the owner of a grocery business. When the business failed, they left for Hong Kong, hoping for better fortune. Ho became a hairdresser in nearby Macau, but after discovering <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> another wife and children she decided to return to Singapore alone, vowing never to remarry. At about that same time, she became a vegetarian.|$|E

5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
