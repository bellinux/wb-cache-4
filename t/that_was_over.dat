5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|Thayer School of Engineering offers {{graduate}} and undergraduate education in engineering sciences at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. The school {{was established in}} 1867 with funds from Brig. Gen. Sylvanus Thayer, known {{for his work in}} establishing an engineering curriculum at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Located in a two-building complex along the Connecticut River on the Dartmouth campus, the Thayer School today offers undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as dual-degree programs with institutions throughout the US. Over 500students are currently enrolled at Thayer, overseen by a faculty of 56 and preceded by over 4,500 living alumni of the school. In 2016 Thayer became the first US national research university with a graduating class of engineering undergraduates <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 50% female.|$|E
5|$|The D-class destroyers were {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning, but were transferred to the China Station in 1935. Like the C class, most were temporarily deployed in the Red Sea when the Italians invaded Abyssinia, but returned to the China Station when <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> They were still there when the war began, but reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards. Five ships were transferred to Home Fleet in December 1939, but Duchess was sunk en route when she was accidentally rammed by the battleship HMS Barham, and Duncan was badly damaged when she collided with a merchant ship, requiring lengthy repairs. Daring was sunk by a German submarine in February 1940. The other two participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June, but Delight was sunk by German aircraft in July and Diana {{was transferred to the}} RCN as a replacement for the Crescent after she was sunk by the cruiser Calcutta. However, she too was rammed and sunk several months later by a freighter that she was escorting.|$|E

5|$|After {{hatching}} {{the chick}} is brooded by a parent {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 50 years.|$|E

25|$|In the South, {{many poor}} whites were {{illiterate}} {{as there was}} almost no public education before the war. In 1880, for example, the white illiteracy rate was about 25% in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia; and as high as 33% in North Carolina. This compares with the 9% national rate, and a black rate of illiteracy <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 70% in the South.

The Falcon's 'king-size' drum brakes actually had less lining area than the Zephyr's, but they were stopping a car <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> 100kg lighter, so were adequate. Whereas the North American model used an 'economy' 3.10 to 1 rear-axle ratio, the Australian Falcon was built with a 3.56 to 1 ratio, which better complemented the torque characteristics of the engine, yet still allowed a reduction in cruising rpm {{when compared with the}} Zephyr.|$|E

The trade pact helped Germany to circumvent the British blockade. In the first year, Germany received hundreds of thousands of tons of cereals, oil, and other vital raw materials, transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories. In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders (though only the raider Komet used the route before June 1941), which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.|$|E

The highlight of his tour was the unbeaten 130 that he scored against the Calcutta Club in the first match of the tour. Later, he played a number of matches against second-class counties for the MCC. One MCC match in 1895, against Essex, was his second and final first-class game: he scored 8 and 4 in a low-scoring match <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> inside two days. Later he appeared in the Minor Counties Championship for Northumberland from 1900 to 1902. In late 1913, aged 48, Greenway captained the Incogniti team {{on a tour of}} North America.

25|$|Vigorous tornado {{activity}} {{continued on}} May 28. While the Storm Prediction Center only issued a slight risk that day, widespread tornadoes touched down in several states, some strong to violent. Several powerful supercell thunderstorms developed in central Kansas that afternoon, and large tornadoes were reported. Near {{the town of}} Corning, a strong EF3 carved an unusual V-shaped path through rural areas west of town, and completely destroyed two homes. An even larger tornado, an EF3 wedge <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> a quarter mile wide, touched down just west of Bennington, and remained nearly stationary in a field for over an hour. This tornado resulted in relatively moderate damage, but killed over 100 head of livestock. The tornado was originally rated EF4 based on mobile radar readings, but ground surveys did not reveal damage indicative of EF4 wind speeds, and the tornado was downgraded to an EF3 as a result. Later that evening, large tornadoes were sighted in southern Michigan, prompting several tornado emergencies. A total of six tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in areas near Flint, two of which reached EF2 intensity and caused significant damage. Numerous weak tornadoes were documented in other states.|$|E

25|$|Later, as the Australian {{infantry}} divisions {{were moved}} to the European battlefield, the battalion was moved to France in June 1916 where they took {{their place in the}} trenches along the Western Front. Their first involvement in the fighting came at the Battle of Fromelles in July 1916, where the battalion took part in the first stages of the Allied attack and suffered over 600 casualties, a total which equated to around a third of their total casualties for the war. They remained at the front for the next two months, before being withdrawn for a rest. Once <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> the battalion rotated between manning defensive positions at the front and undertaking training and labouring duties in the rear areas. After spending the winter in the trenches in the Somme Valley, in early 1917 after the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line to shorten their lines of communication and free up reserves, the 53rd Battalion took part in the brief Allied pursuit, culminating in them being committed to hold the ground won during the Second Battle of Bullecourt. Later in the year, they {{were moved to}} Ypres in Belgium where they took part in the Battle of Polygon Wood in late September.|$|E
25|$|Germany and the Soviet Union {{entered an}} {{intricate}} trade pact on February 11, 1940 <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> four {{times larger than}} the one the two countries had signed in August 1939. The trade pact helped Germany to surmount a British blockade of Germany. In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. These and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories, and this allowed Nazi Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade. The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship Bismarck, heavy naval guns, other naval gear and thirty of Germany's latest warplanes, including the Me-109 fighter, Me-110 fighter and Ju-88 bomber. The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools and samples of Germany artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items. The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk. This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping.|$|E
