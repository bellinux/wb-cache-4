40|$|International audienceThis paper {{regards the}} problem of optimally placing {{unreliable}} sensors in a one-dimensional environment.

We provide a computational method to find <b>the</b> optimal <b>placement</b> and we estimate the costs of <b>the</b> equispaced <b>placement</b> and of <b>the</b> uniform random <b>placement.</b> When <b>the</b> number of sensors goes to infinity, <b>the</b> equispaced <b>placement</b> is asymptotically equivalent to <b>the</b> optimal <b>placement</b> (that is, <b>the</b> ratio between their costs converges to one), whereas the cost of <b>the</b> random <b>placement</b> remains strictly larger...|$|R

30|$|To achieve truly secure deletion, Chen et al. (2016) {{proposed}} TedFlash, a truly secure deletion {{scheme for}} NAND flash-based block devices.

Note that as <b>the</b> random <b>placement</b> of data is independent and does not affect <b>the</b> <b>placements</b> of any other data, TedFlash can eliminate the structural artifacts brought by each write. Most importantly, <b>the</b> random <b>placement</b> technique is exclusively feasible for NAND flash, because: 1) Random seeks on flash memory are as efficient as sequential seeks. 2) <b>The</b> random <b>placements</b> can distribute data evenly among flash, naturally achieving a good wear leveling.|$|R
