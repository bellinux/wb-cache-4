5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> store {{information}} such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|E

5|$|Activision {{provided}} {{a budget of}} US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time.

When rewriting {{one of the}} programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which {{made it difficult for}} him <b>to</b> <b>communicate,</b> <b>and</b> he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E

5|$|Mainly a herbivore, its diet is {{primarily}} grasses and leaves. Common elands form herds {{of up to}} 500 animals, but are not territorial. The common eland prefers habitats {{with a wide variety}} of flowering plants such as savannah, woodlands, and open and montane grasslands; it avoids dense forests. It uses loud barks, visual and postural movements and the flehmen response <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> warn others of danger. The common eland is used by humans for leather, meat, and rich, nutritious milk, and has been domesticated in many areas.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals <b>to</b> <b>communicate,</b> <b>and</b> locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{churches have}} also engaged in {{reconciliation}} initiatives {{such as the}} Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> develop mutual understanding. In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health {{organizations such as the}} AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.|$|E

In its third-quarter 2014 earnings report, Burger King admitted that the massive social media attention was one of the primary reasons it brought the product back. The positive reaction to the reintroduction included over one million mentions on Twitter. This tied into a major push by the company to utilize social media as a free marketing tool to millennials, who overwhelmingly utilize interactive media <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> prefer companies that utilize these tools.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman {{begins in}} medias res with the upper-class Maria's unjust {{imprisonment}} by her husband, George Venables. Not only has he condemned Maria {{to live in}} an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is not mad, agrees to bring her a few books. Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his marginalia. The two begin <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> eventually meet. Darnford reveals that he has had a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{suffered from}} a combination of bad weather and poor pilot navigation, which caused many of the airborne troops to be dropped inaccurately throughout the divisional operational area causing a number of casualties and making conducting operations much more difficult. In particular, the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was assigned the task of destroying the Merville artillery battery, was only able to gather up a fraction of its strength before it had to attack the battery, with the result that the depleted force suffered heavy casualties. However, the battery was successfully assaulted and the guns inside it disabled. The division's other objectives were also achieved despite the problems encountered. A small force of glider-borne troops, from the 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, secured two bridges over the Caen Canal and River Orne in a coup-de-main operation. The other bridges were destroyed by the division, and a number of villages were occupied. A bridgehead was formed by the division, and it successfully repulsed a number of German counter-attacks until Allied ground forces from the invasion beaches reached its positions. The actions of the division severely limited the ability of the German defenders <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>and</b> organise themselves, ensuring that the seaborne troops could not be attacked during the vital first few hours after landing when they were most vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|Distributed-memory {{implementations}} {{of several}} scientific applications require array redistribution. Array redistribution {{is used in}} languages such as High Performance Fortran to dynamically change the distribution of arrays across processors. Performing array redistribution incurs two overheads - an indexing overhead for determining the set of processors <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with <b>and</b> the array elements <b>to</b> be <b>communicated,</b> <b>and</b> a communication overhead for performing the necessary irregular all-to-many personalized communication. In this paper efficient runtime methods for performing array redistribution are presented. To reduce the indexing overhead, precise closed forms for enumerating the processors <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with <b>and</b> the array elements <b>to</b> be <b>communicated</b> are developed for two special cases of array redistribution involving block-cyclically distributed arrays.
