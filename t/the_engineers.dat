5|$|U.S. President Caldwell assigns Fisher, his {{colleague}} Charlie Cole, CIA agent Isaac Briggs and Anna Grímsdóttir to Fourth Echelon, a new special-ops and counter-terrorism unit. Charged with stopping <b>the</b> <b>Engineers,</b> the group uses the cargo plane Paladin as its command center. Fourth Echelon first aims to secure Andriy Kobin, a CIA hostage believed to possess information on <b>the</b> <b>Engineers.</b> Fisher extracts {{him from a}} safe house in Benghazi, and learns that his associates have ties to <b>the</b> <b>Engineers.</b> Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold, he finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that the executioner is Majid Sadiq; a former MI6 agent, Sadiq demands the Fourth Echelon to stop interfering.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} <b>the</b> <b>engineers</b> {{struggled with}} {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. <b>The</b> <b>engineers</b> therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that their}} next target is a water-filtration plant near Navy Pier, Fisher infiltrates <b>the</b> <b>Engineers</b> and {{prevents}} {{the release of}} a biological toxin into the water supply. Kobin then tells him that mercenary supplier Reza Nouri may be allied with <b>the</b> <b>Engineers.</b> Sam assaults Nouri's mansion, capturing him for questioning. When he learns about an Engineer sleeper cell in London, Fisher infiltrates an abandoned mill and discovers chemical bombs in a shipping bay. Opening a bomb to plant a tracking device, he is exposed to nerve gas. Incapacitated and apparently dying, Fisher is captured by Sadiq and rescued by Briggs; in the ensuing confrontation, Sadiq escapes while Briggs provides first aid to Sam.|$|E

40|$|To <b>the</b> contractor, <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> {{estimate}} is <b>the</b> target number to aim for, and {{the basis for}} a contractor to evaluate the accuracy of their estimate. To <b>the</b> owner, <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> {{estimate is}} <b>the</b> basis for funding, evaluation of bids, and for predicting project costs. As such <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate is <b>the</b> benchmark. This research sought to investigate the reliance on, and the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate in heavy civil cost estimate. The research objective was to characterize <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate and allow owners and contractors re-evaluate or affirm their reliance on <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate. A literature review was conducted to understand the reliance on <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate, and secondary data from Washington State Department of Transportation was used to investigate the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate. <b>The</b> findings show the need for practitioners to re-evaluate their reliance on <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate. <b>The</b> empirical data showed that, within various contexts, <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate fell outside the expected accuracy range of the low bids or the cost to complete projects. The study recommends direct tracking of costs by project owners while projects are under construction, the use of a second estimate to improve the accuracy of their estimates, and use of the cost estimating practices found in highly reputable construction companies...|$|R

5|$|Intertwined {{with the}} main plot, the co-op {{missions}} begin with Fisher and Briggs infiltrating Kashmir.

5|$|Like the infantry, <b>the</b> <b>engineers</b> {{had been}} pushed off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their {{assigned}} locations. Three teams came in {{where there were no}} infantry or armor to cover them. Working under heavy fire, <b>the</b> <b>engineers</b> set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles—work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>engineers</b> succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Engineers</b> {{comprehensively}} defeated their quarter-final opponents, Maidenhead, winning 7–0, {{the first}} time a team had ever scored as many as seven goals in an FA Cup match. Oxford, on the other hand, were paired with Wanderers, who had won the competition in both its first two seasons and never lost an FA Cup match. They had defeated <b>the</b> <b>Engineers</b> in the 1872 final and Oxford in the 1873 final. The first match finished in a 1–1 draw, necessitating a replay which Oxford won 1–0 to end Wanderers' grip on the competition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Engineers</b> try to flee Site F, using Briggs and {{the hostages}} as human shields. Fisher, {{disguised}} as an Air Force hostage, helps Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men. Sadiq escapes on foot, and Fisher disarms and seriously wounds him. Sadiq boasts {{that he has}} already won; if he dies twelve nations supporting <b>the</b> <b>Engineers</b> will declare war on the U.S. {{and if he is}} tried, he will leak U.S. information. Although Fisher spares Sadiq, he detains him. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations; in a post-credits scene, a recovered Coste and Fisher prepare to interrogate Sadiq.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Engineers,</b> {{also known}} as space jockeys, are an ancient race of large humanoids which created {{humanity}} from their own DNA during Earth's primordial era. In Alien, the fossilized corpse of an Engineer is discovered in the pilot's seat of the derelict alien spacecraft; its suit and helmet {{were thought to be}} bones, and is the first victim of the Aliens identified onscreen. <b>The</b> <b>Engineers</b> {{play a central role in}} the first prequel, Prometheus, which reveals their biology and intention to infect the human race with an alien contagion and mutagen. In the film, the last surviving Engineer on LV-223 is awakened and immediately tries to resume his mission of delivering the substance to Earth, but he is subsequently stopped by the survivors of the human expedition. The android David 8 pilots an Engineer ship to the species' home world, where he unleashes the mutagen against the population, which kills all <b>the</b> <b>Engineers</b> and all other non-floral life on the planet.|$|E
