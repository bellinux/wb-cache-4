Lemmon, USA. An analysis of the two-color VR CCD observations of <b>this</b> <b>variable</b> <b>covers</b> all the phase intervals for the first time. The light curves show this object can be classified as an Algol-type variable with tidally distorted components, and an asymmetry of the maxima (the O’Connell effect). The periodogram analysis confirms the cycle numbering of Andronov et al. (2012) and for the initial approximation, the ephemeris is used as follows: Min I. BJD = 2456074. 4904 + 0. 3348837 E. For phenomenological modeling, we used the trigonometric polynomial approximation of statistically optimal degree, and a recent method “NAV” (“New Algol Variable”) using local specific shapes for the eclipse. Methodological aspects and estimates of the physical parameters based on analysis of phenomenological parameters are presented. As results of our phenomenological model, we obtained for the inclination i= 90 °, M 1 = 0. 745 M◉, M 2 = 0. 854 M◉, M=M 1 +M 2 = 1. 599 M◉, the orbital separation a= 1. 65 · 109 m= 2. 37 R◉ and relative radii r 1 =R 1 /a= 0. 314 and r 2 =R 2 /a= 0. 360. These estimates may be used as preliminary starting values for further modeling using extended physical models based on the Wilson & Devinney (1971) code and it's extension...|$|E

40|$|A {{portfolio}} choice model in continuous time is formulated for both complete and incomplete markets, where the quantile {{function of the}} terminal cash flow, instead of the cash flow itself, is taken as the decision <b>variable.</b> <b>This</b> formulation <b>covers</b> a wide body of existing and new models with law-invariant preference measures, including expected utility maximization, mean-variance, goal reaching, Yaari's dual model, Lopes' SP/A model, behavioral model under prospect theory, {{as well as those}} explicitly involving VaR and CVaR in objectives and/or constraints. A solution scheme to this quantile model is proposed, and then demonstrated by solving analytically the goal-reaching model and Yaari's dual model. A general property derived for the quantile model is that the optimal terminal payment is anticomonotonic with the pricing kernel (or with the minimal pricing kernel {{in the case of an}} incomplete market if the investment opportunity set is deterministic). As a consequence, the mutual fund theorem still holds in a market where rational and irrational agents co-exist. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem in which a client stores {{a large amount of}} data with an untrusted server in such a way that, at any moment, the client can ask the server to compute a {{function}} on some portion of its outsourced data. In this scenario, the client must be able to efficiently verify the correctness of the result despite no longer knowing the inputs of the delegated computation, it must be able to keep adding elements to its remote storage, and it does not have to fix in advance (i. e., at data outsourcing time) the functions that it will delegate. Even more ambitiously, clients should be able to verify in time independent of the input-size – a very appealing property for computations over huge amounts of data.

To address it in our colored Petri net tool, we give an algorithm for computing enabled transition instances. This algorithm is based on pattern matching. So it first tries to bind tokens to <b>variables</b> <b>covered</b> by patterns. If some <b>variables</b> are not <b>covered</b> by any pattern, the algorithm will bind all the colors in the corresponding color sets to the <b>variables.</b> <b>This</b> algorithm uses the new principle of partial binding- partial test and adopts some optimization techniques for preprocessing to improve efficiency. The principle of partial binding- partial test allows us to test the expressions during the partial binding process so as to prone invalid bindings as early as possible. The preprocessing with optimization techniques not only prunes a lot of invalid potential bindings before the binding begins, but also finds disabled transitions at an early phase. ...|$|R
