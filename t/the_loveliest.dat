5|$|Dating from 1074 to 1548, Lincoln Cathedral {{is one of}} {{the largest}} of England’s cathedrals and it has been claimed by John Ruskin that, architecturally, it is worth any two of the others put together. Edward Freeman {{described}} it as “one of <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> of human works.” It retains portions of the three massive arches of the Norman west front and much heavily restored sculpture around the central portal. The central tower is the tallest in England and is visible for many miles as it rises in spectacular fashion from a high hill. The decagonal Chapter House with its huge flying buttresses is the first polygonal chapter house in England. Of the interior, the finest part is considered to be the late-13th-century “Angel Choir” with “gorgeous layers of tracery” and enriched with carved angels. The transepts have two rose windows, the “Dean’s Eye” on the north dating from c. 1200 and retaining its original glass, while the Flowing Decorated “Bishop’s Eye” on the south is filled with salvaged medieval fragments.|$|E

25|$|Ascents of Grange Fell can {{be started}} from Rosthwaite, Grange in Borrowdale or Watendlath. The Rosthwaite to Watendlath {{bridleway}} can be utilised to its highest point before striking northerly {{to the summit}} of Brund Fell following a high dry stone wall {{for much of the}} way. The climb from Grange goes through the picturesque deciduous woodland {{at the foot of the}} fell and skirts round Greatend Crag before reaching King's How and is ranked as one of <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> short walks in the Lake District. The two principal summits of Brund Fell and King's How should both be climbed by any visitor to the fell and they are linked by an undulating path through the hillocks.|$|E

25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E

Burton also wrote in his diary that [...] "I wanted that diamond because it is incomparably lovely... and it should be on <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> woman in the world. I would have had a fit if it went to Jackie Kennedy or Sophia Loren or Mrs. Huntingdon Misfit of Dallas, Texas". The diamond was subsequently named the [...] "Taylor Burton Diamond".

500|$|The video shows Madonna and Višnjić playing chess and {{ultimately}} the singer destroying the chess board, symbolizing an end to their relationship.

The video is color graded to a blue-green tint and the chess scene was inspired by that in the 1968 heist film, The Thomas Crown Affair (with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway).

500|$|During rehearsals {{and even}} during {{the run of the}} show, the music was {{repeatedly}} revised by Rodgers in an attempt to gear the songs to Traubel's voice. According to Bruce Pomahac of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, [...] "as she began to get cold feet about what her New York fans would think about her as a belter, the keys of each of her numbers edged upward." [...] One of Traubel's numbers saw three different versions before being scrapped in favor of, according to Pomahac, [...] "something that sounded like an excerpt from Traubel’s Vegas act." [...] "All At Once You Love Her" [...] saw some popularity when recorded, during the run of the show, by Perry Como; in what Pomahac speculates was an attempt to appease Traubel, a reprise of the song was added for her, and provided [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> moments in all of Pipe Dream". The Organization announced that a new vocal score would be published in 2012, though it has not appeared as of 2017—the existing score reflects revisions made when Nancy Andrews took over the part.|$|E
500|$|In January 1952 Ferrier joined Britten and Pears in a {{short series}} of concerts {{to raise funds for}} Britten's English Opera Group. Writing later, Britten {{recalled}} this tour as [...] "perhaps <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> of all" [...] of his artistic associations with Ferrier. Despite continuing health problems, she sang in the St Matthew Passion at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March, Messiah at the Free Trade Hall on 13 April, and Das Lied von der Erde with Barbirolli and the Hallé on 23 and 24 April. On 30 April Ferrier attended a private party at which the new Queen, ElizabethII, and her sister, Princess Margaret, were present. In her diary, Ferrier notes: [...] "Princess M sang—very good!". Her health continued to deteriorate; she refused to consider a course of androgen injections, believing that this treatment would destroy the quality of her voice. In May she travelled to Vienna to record Das Lied and Mahler's Rückert-Lieder with Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic; singer and conductor had long sought to preserve their partnership on disc. Despite considerable suffering, Ferrier completed the recording sessions between 15 and 20 May.|$|E
500|$|Edmund Gosse, in The Academy, enthused: [...] "The style he {{has adopted}} is more exalted and less idyllic, more rapturous and less luxurious – in a word, more {{spirited}} and more virile {{than that of}} any of his earlier works." [...] The Literary World {{agreed that it was}} [...] "the manliest and <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> work of Mr. Morris's genius", going on to predict that [...] "Whatever its immediate reception may be, William Morris's Sigurd is certain eventually to take its place among the few great epics of the English tongue." [...] The note of caution as to the reaction of the 19th century reading public was sounded more strongly by several other critics. [...] Theodore Watts wrote in The Athenaeum, [...] "That this is a noble poem there can be no doubt; but whether it will meet with ready appreciation and sympathy in this country is a question not so easily disposed of." [...] He thought it [...] "Mr. Morris's greatest achievement", but worried about the choice of metre, which he thought monotonous in effect. In an unfavourable review for Fraser's Magazine, Henry Hewlett complained that [...] "The narrative seldom rises above mediocrity...the memory finds little to carry away, and the ear still less to haunt it."

Votta wrote that [...] "Finn sounds the best he's sounded", and Futterman noted that Finn held [...] "his own against Rachel, vocally"—she liked {{the fact that}} it was Finn singing to Rachel instead of the usual other way around and was [...] "grateful to the Glee team for assigning plot-relevant songs". Lynch felt that the song [...] "seemed to slow down the otherwise wonderfully paced episode" [...] and would have preferred it if they had cut the song and [...] "kept the Warblers' version of 'I Want You Back' instead". He was more enthusiastic about [...] "Black or White", which he characterized as [...] "musically awesome but dramatically confusing" [...] and graded an [...] "A−". Futterman said that [...] "Artie once again nails the MJ impression", and Goldberg declared that the [...] "chorus with Santana leading charge and Artie's rap" [...] were [...] "spot on". Bell agreed that the song showed that [...] "Artie is still New Directions' go-to rapper", but noted that she did not feel that New Directions had successfully demonstrated that they [...] "knew the true meaning of Michael Jackson". Chaney was unenthusiastic and gave the song a [...] "C", while Flandez had more negative opinion than hers: [...] "Sebastian Smythe got our reaction right: a slow-handed clap".|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of <b>the</b> <b>loveliest</b> monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E
