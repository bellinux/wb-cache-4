5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and <b>tangerine</b> from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and <b>tangerine</b> strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's development, {{the music}} team were shown an early build before {{starting}} {{work on the}} score. Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. Edgar Froese, <b>Tangerine</b> Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with <b>Tangerine</b> Dream in Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.|$|E

5|$|While the 2009 International Bowl {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl game, {{it was not the}} first time the school had been invited to a bowl. Fifty years earlier, the 1958 Buffalo Bulls team finished with a record of 8–1. They were awarded the Lambert Cup, given to the best small college team in the eastern US, and received a bid to play in the 1958 <b>Tangerine</b> Bowl, where they would face Florida State. There was one catch: the team's African-American players—starting running back Willie Evans and backup defensive end Mike Wilson—would not be allowed to play. The <b>Tangerine</b> Bowl Stadium was controlled by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who prohibited integrated football games. University officials and the coaching staff decided to allow the team to vote on whether they would accept the bowl bid. Before secret ballots could be passed out, the players unanimously decided to reject the bid.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{evaluate}} quantitatively as well as qualitatively possible future developments in international trade of oranges and <b>tangerines,</b> and the possible impact of these developments on the export of oranges and <b>tangerines</b> by Israel. After World War II, international trade in oranges and <b>tangerines</b> increased rapidly, mostly {{as a result of the}} rapid rise in standards of living and the improvements in diet habits which took place in many countries at that time. These favorable marketing conditions encouraged the planting of new groves in the citrus growing areas of the world and particularly those of the Mediterranean countries...|$|R

5|$|United's playing kit {{consists}} of <b>tangerine</b> shirts and black shorts, first used {{when the team}} played under the Dallas Tornado moniker in the United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they {{were invited to participate}} in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter, more modern image.

5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and <b>tangerine</b> shirts with white shorts.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found {{inspiration}} in Pink Floyd and <b>Tangerine</b> Dream. Boyd Rice {{was influenced by}} the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture.

Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of musique concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited a long list of obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti and Miles Davis's On the Corner.
