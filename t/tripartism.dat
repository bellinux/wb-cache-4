25|$|Young {{communist}} militants (UJRF) {{were also}} accused of sabotage actions like the famous Henri Martin affair {{and the case}} of Raymonde Dien, who was jailed one year for having blocked an ammunition train, {{with the help of}} other militants, in order to prevent the supply of French forces in Indochina in February 1950. Similar actions against trains occurred in Roanne, Charleville, Marseille, and Paris. Even ammunition sabotage by PCF agents has been reported, such as grenades exploding in the hands of legionaries. These actions became such a cause for concern by 1950 that the French Assembly voted a law against sabotage between March 2–8. At this session tension was so high between politicians that fighting ensued in the assembly following communist deputees’ speeches against the Indochinese policy. This month saw the French navy mariner and communist militant Henri Martin arrested by military police and jailed for five years for sabotage and propaganda operations in Toulon's arsenal. On May 5 communist Ministers were dismissed from the government, marking the end of <b>Tripartism.</b> A few months later on November 11, 1950, the French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez went to Moscow.|$|E
25|$|A law on worker’s {{democracy}} in public-sector companies {{was passed in}} July 1983 which sought to recreate a spirit of <b>tripartism</b> in a {{sector of the economy}} where existing statutory rights had failed to provide anything more than a consultative role for representatives. Previously, workers had the right to be represented on the boards of public sector companies with 50 or more staff and were entitled to at least 2 board seats, but under the new legislation, public sector companies (previously nationalized companies plus those companies that were nationalized in 1982 in which the state was the majority shareholder) would be obliged to have tripartite administrative or supervisory boards to which employee representatives would be elected by the workforce. A couple of autogestionary measures were also introduced. One measure involved workers’ representation on the administrative councils of the nationalized industries, under which one-third of the members of these councils being drawn from the workforce. The other measure involved elections to the administrative commissions for social security, under which 15 and 25 members of these commissions were chosen through elections among those who were insured by the fund.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tripartism</b> {{refers to}} {{economic}} corporatism based on tripartite contracts of business, labour, and state affiliations within the economy. Each is {{to act as}} a social partner to create economic policy through cooperation, consultation, negotiation, and compromise. <b>Tripartism</b> is a common form in neo-corporatism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tripartism</b> {{became a}} popular form of {{economic}} policy during the economic crisis of the 1930s. <b>Tripartism</b> was supported {{from a number of}} different political perspectives at this time: one was Catholic social teaching; fascism supported this for fascist unions but repressed communist and social democratic unions; and in democratic politics. <b>Tripartism</b> is a prominent economic policy in Europe, particularly where Christian Democratic parties influenced by Catholic social teaching have held power; it is a core part of the economic systems in Scandinavia and the Benelux that were put in place by social democratic governments. An example is a national income policy agreement in Finland. Tripartite agreements are an important component in practical labour law, since they cover not only wages, but also issues such as policies on benefits, vacation, workhours and worker safety.|$|E
50|$|To sum up, ILO {{offered the}} world {{different}} way to solve social strife. It provided it with the procedures and techniques of bargaining and negotiation to replace violent conflict {{as a means of}} securing more humane and dignified conditions of work. While there have been problems along the way, <b>tripartism</b> has generally survived without successful challenge to the principle, despite attempts by the Soviet Union, in particular, to weaken it. As World War II would to a close, the value of <b>tripartism</b> was reaffirmed in Declaration of Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|Corporatism {{may also}} refer to {{economic}} <b>tripartism</b> involving negotiations between business, labour, and state interest groups to establish economic policy. This is sometimes {{also referred to}} as neo-corporatism and is associated with social democracy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tripartism</b> in Singapore, {{which refers}} to the {{collaboration}} among Singapore unions, employers and the government, has been practised since 1965 when NTUC and the Singapore government signed a Charter for Industrial Progress and a Productivity Code of Practice. In the 1960s, the <b>tripartism</b> institution was still weak, but {{the formation of the}} National Wages Council (NWC) in 1972 and later the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) in 2007 helped strengthen ties between the members.The tripartite was set up to strive for better working conditions for employees in Singapore and to maintain harmonious employment relations through the implementation of specific policies governing labour relations.|$|E
50|$|According to the ILO’s definition, {{it means}} the {{practice}} of <b>tripartism</b> between governments and the representative organizations of workers and employers within and across borders are now more relevant to achieving solutions and to building up social cohesion {{and the rule of}} law through, among other means, international labor standards.|$|E
50|$|Social {{dialogue}} in France {{was hard to}} be national because of the political opposite in groups of social partner.

50|$|The International Labour Organization is {{the only}} United Nations agency {{that is based on}} <b>tripartism.</b> It uses the discussions between the three groups in {{drafting}} of standards and conventions. Also for the implementation of ILO-standards in national law tripartite consultations on a national level are a requirement for those countries party to the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976.|$|E
50|$|The Employment Act {{offers little}} {{protection}} to white-collar workers {{due to an}} income threshold. The Industrial Arbitration Court handles labour-management disputes that cannot be resolved informally through the Ministry of Manpower.

5000|$|The ILO is {{valuable}} for both workers and employers {{because of the}} voice and influence that it offers them. One author aptly characterizes the importance of <b>tripartism,</b> when discussing the ILO’s remarkable survival through World War II, as having been both a straitjacket and a lifejacket. As the ILO’s Committee on Freedom of Association put it, [...] "the right conferred upon workers' and employers' organizations {{must be based on}} respect for those civil liberties which have been enunciated in particular in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the absence of these civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights.Ever if <b>tripartism</b> makes the ILO far more representative of civil society than any other intergovernmental organization, employers' and workers' organization, employers’ and workers’ organizations necessarily represent the formal economy rather than the huge -and growing-informal economy, especially in developing nations. In addition, with membership of trade unions shrinking in many industrialized states, the representativeness of these organizations even in the formal sector is often questioned.The challenge for the ILO and its constituents is to adapt the [...] model to a globalizing world, where there are new actors operating outside national frameworks and increasingly diverse forms of voice and representation. Some measures of accommodation have been found, for instance involving cooperation with NGOs in action against child labour, and dialogue with parliamentarians and other important actors. The broader challenge remains.|$|E
5000|$|Neo-corporatism favoured {{economic}} <b>tripartism</b> {{which involved}} strong labour unions, employers' unions, and governments that cooperated as [...] "social partners" [...] {{to negotiate and}} manage a national economy. Social corporatist systems instituted in Europe after World War II include the ordoliberal system of the social market economy in Germany, the social partnership in Ireland, the polder model in the Netherlands (although arguably the polder model already {{was present at the}} end of the First World War, it was not until after WW II that a social service systemgained foothold there), the concertation system in Italy, the Rhine model in Switzerland and the Benelux countries, and the Nordic model in Scandinavia.|$|E
50|$|The {{implications}} of <b>tripartism</b> in the ILO are manifold. To put it simply, the {{participation in the}} ILO deliberations of delegates directly representing the interest of workers and employers adds a connection with economic reality that cannot be reproduced in an organization where governments are the only spokespersons.The roles played by representatives of workers and employers differ markedly. For workers, the ILO is a major instrument to pursue their goals, {{and they have a}} much more active agenda than employers. On the other hand, employers frequently play the role of the “brake” on initiatives put forward both by the workers and the Office and its Director-General, to slow action they consider hasty, or which would work against the perceived interest of business.|$|E

50|$|The {{functions}} of ILO in Armenia are coordinating by the ILO Decent Work Technical Support Team and Country Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which {{are supported by}} the ILO National Coordinator in Yerevan. Co-operation between the Republic of Armenia and the ILO {{are based on the}} constituent of the International Labor Organization, which are government, employers’ and workers’ organizations. One of the most important problems for Armenia is the development of employment policies. So, the government of the Republic of Armenia decides to begin the improvement of the employment policy by giving preference to active labor market policy programs instead of passive programs. The ILO helps Armenia to create and improve incentives for active labor market by training and educating the employments. Another crucial issue for Armenia is to strengthen <b>tripartism</b> and social dialogue. The ILO constituents - Ministry of Labor and Social Issues, the Republican Union of Employers of Armenia (RUEA) and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Armenia take into account the social dialogue, consultations and negotiations to find agreement on relevant national policies. The ILO helps RUEA by providing specialized services for its members and support socio-economic policy in the framework of national tripartite cooperation. The government of Armenia has recently accepted the renewed policy system for public wages. The ILO supports Armenia by providing comprehensive and detailed analysis of the current public pay practice by examining the wage levels and structures.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of peak-level <b>tripartism</b> on {{economic}} reforms in Singapore and South Korea. Specifically, the paper attempts to answer the question of whether <b>tripartism</b> alters the pace, the sequence, the mix, or the content of economic reforms or the environment in which the reforms are implemented. It also seeks to obtain evidence on the impact of <b>tripartism</b> on specific measurable outcomes...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} the varied impact of <b>tripartism</b> on economic reforms {{and its consequences}} for socio-economic outcomes in Slovenia and Poland the two countries that {{can be characterized as}} cases of strong and weak <b>tripartism</b> respectively. The analysis probes into three different hypotheses about the beneficial impact of <b>tripartism</b> on macroeconomic outcomes, distributive outcomes, and reform sustainability. The paper finds mixed results with respect to the contribution of <b>tripartism</b> to macroeconomic outcomes: no impact is detected with respect to inflation, but available evidence suggests its beneficial contribution in Slovenia through a particular combination of negotiated incomes policies, active labor market policies, and employment protection legislation. The impact with respect to distributive outcome is less ambiguous: there is clear evidence that the well functioning <b>tripartism</b> has contributed to more equal distribution of income and low poverty rates in Slovenia. Finally, I find a positive impact of <b>tripartism</b> on reform sustainability. Whether or not particular reforms were negotiated between the state and social partners has evidently affected the degree to which these reforms have proved to be sustainable and supported by trade unions, who are normally most likely to mobilize against policies generating material hardships...|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} the ‘new phase’ of the European social dialogue’s credentials as a system of European <b>tripartism.</b> Arguing that <b>tripartism</b> has historically exhibited four key features, the article assesses these features’ viability {{in the context of}} a transnational interest representation regime. Though the ‘new phase’ of the social dialogue is found to engage with innovative topics, it also emerges as being characterized by peripheral output and piecemeal implementation outcomes. The article’s conclusion is thus sceptical, and notes difficulties associated with transnational <b>tripartism</b> and the increasing dilution of the European social dialogue...|$|E
40|$|This article explores {{one of the}} {{foundational}} features of the International Labour Organization (ILO) – <b>tripartism,</b> or in other words, {{the fact that it}} is an institution that brings together representatives of Governments, Employers and Workers – in the light of recent events that have threatened the organisation’s smooth functioning. Disagreement over the interpretation of a convention within the ILO supervisory bodies has revealed the changing balance of power between Employers and Workers, and potentially signals a need to rethink the basis of <b>tripartism.</b> At the same time, however, <b>tripartism</b> is a fundamental distinguishing feature of the ILO, one that arguably sets it apart from other international bodies, and is essential to both the organisation’s mission and the generation of international labour law more generally. This article re-visits the notion of <b>tripartism,</b> examines the problems that its practice within the ILO raises including with regard to issues of representativity and more recent disagreements, as well as the true significance of the current crisis of <b>tripartism</b> and its possible impact for the ILO and international labour law...|$|E

40|$|Time is {{essential}} for a nation to transition from a planned economy {{to a market economy}} and from autarchy to democracy. <b>Tripartism,</b> an institution that brings together labor, enterprise and government in state sponsored associations, appears to have been helpful to buy time for economic and political transition in Eastern Europe. China, similarly faced with a large inefficient state structure and dependent, statesponsored worker unions, may look to Eastern Europe as a model for transitioning to privatization and union independence. Chinese leaders could find <b>tripartism</b> an attractive institutional alternative because its socialist perspective mirrors that of China and because it has a record of building social consensus in a time of social upheaval and political transition. 1 <b>Tripartism</b> in Eastern Europe: A Model for China’s Trade Union Reform...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tripartism</b> {{has been}} all the rage {{since the early days}} of Eastern and Central Europe's transition. In the Visegrad {{countries}} its institutionalisation has often been formal. In the eastern and western Balkans on the other hand, peak-level social dialogue has been clearly mobilised and institutionalised by governments. By comparing Bulgaria and Romania, this article seeks to highlight the inherent traits of these two experiences in <b>tripartism,</b> since the transition through to the present crisis. The identification of a " <b>tripartism</b> of political legitimacy " echoes and complements the thesis of an " illusory corporatism " put forward by D. Ost (2000). It raises two questions that run through research today. The first concerns the decisive role played by factors external to domestic socio-politics, and which for both these countries exemplify the model of " dependent capitalism ". The second refers to the terms and channels of social Europeanisation in the enlarged EU, being applied here to social dialogue. By way of conclusion, the article stressed a congruence, if not real convergence, between this governmend-led <b>tripartism</b> and the ever-more functionalist and partnership-oriented social dialogue promoted by the EU over the last decade...|$|E
40|$|The article {{compares the}} role of <b>tripartism</b> during and after {{democratic}} transitions in Spain and Poland. In both countries it emerged after a negotiated transition from dictatorship, but it was poorly institutionalised. While it fell short of ‘neocorporatist’ levels of governance, it had a ‘foundational’ function in stabilising both political and economic transitions, and despite its limitations, it endured for decades in the frequent, if unregular, practice of negotiating ‘social pacts’. The comparison reveals some striking similarities despite the contrasting economic systems of origin, and identifies some structural constants {{in the evolution of}} post-democratic <b>tripartism,</b> up to the recent crisis...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} explores {{changes in the}} nature of {{tripartite}} arrangements between firms, governments and organized labour across the last century, focusing on their post- 1945 heyday. Although <b>tripartism</b> has its origins {{at the turn of the}} Twentieth Century, the post- 1945 long boom represented an historical high-water mark that may now be seen as quite distinct from our own long period of volatility and crisis. Historical concerns are frequently stimulated by those of the present and this is especially the case in contemporary history. Anglo-Saxon historians may feel that the age of <b>tripartism</b> is at an end, but the contributions within this issue show that although this may accurately reflect current perceptions, <b>tripartism</b> continues, albeit often in weak forms, in other national and transnational contexts; its history therefore retains contemporary resonance. 	In our present age, it is commonly assumed that the relative power of employers has increased at the expense of government – the central co-ordinating actor in <b>tripartism</b> – and organized labour. Within the firm, not only workers, but also traditional managers have been displaced by assertive investors and allied to them, a new managerial class that has little emotional capital sunk in the firm other than as a vehicle for shareholder value maximization or release, and personal enrichment. From the business historian’s viewpoint, these assumptions raise a number of issues surrounding long term trends and diversity {{in the nature of}} the capitalist ecosystem within which <b>tripartism</b> is located. In this connection, there are four alternative points of view on broad approaches to labour management. The first, rooted in the then apparent solidity of the British postwar tripartite settlement, was that the incorporation of labour’s institutions was structurally essential to the state’s role in avoiding or genuinely resolving crises. The second sees <b>tripartism</b> as very much an historical exception, representing to a large extent a product of a very specific set of historic circumstances around the Great Depression and the post-World War Two long boom. The third, a variant of the second, would see historic compromises between state, the firm, and workers as a reflection of the thirty year period of relative global prosperity and growth which had deeper historic roots stretching back at least into the Nineteenth Century. The fourth highlights national diversity in global capitalism and views the labour management options adopted according not only to temporal trends but also to such dimensions as space, scale, and global centre-periphery relations. The latter view implies that elements of post-war compromises may persist, even if, within many of the advanced societies, they do so in dilute form...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tripartism,</b> the national-level {{interaction}} among representatives of labor, management, and government, occurs infrequently in the United States. Based on the U. S. experience, then, such interactions might seem irrelevant to economic performance and policymaking. The essays {{in this volume}} reveal the falsity of that assumption. Contributors from eight industrialized countries examine {{the changing nature of}} labor management relations, with a particular focus on the role of <b>tripartism</b> and the decentralization of collective bargaining. The vibrancy of the coordinating mechanisms that help shape employment conditions and labor policy contradicts the traditional belief that an overpowering unilateral decentralizing shift is underway in labor-management interactions. The contributors show that these mechanisms are in fact increasing in the face of intensified pressures, promoting greater flexibility in work organization and working time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{assesses the}} degree to which {{tripartite}} forums have emerged within advanced industrial economies in recent years, the factors that facilitate modern <b>tripartism,</b> and the implications of <b>tripartism</b> for economic and social outcomes. It does so by updating the analysis provided in "The New Structure of Labor Relations, " by Katz, Lee and Lee (Cornell University Press, 2004). This paper reviews recent data to assess whether the trends identified by Katz, Lee, and Lee have continued {{in the last three years}} as well as reviewing recent evidence and trends from countries not analyzed in Katz, Lee, and Lee. The paper finds that the trend toward decentralized collective bargaining has persisted yet it has not interfered with the continuation of <b>tripartism</b> in some countries. The paper also finds evidence that effective national partnerships often involve a dense formal and informal network of political exchange, in some cases, involving new rights groups representing women, older worker and immigrants. Experiences in Ireland warrant close attention in part because of the continuing strong performance of the Irish economy and the apparent contribution made to that performance by social partnership. Previous research has shown that a widespread downward shift occurred in the 1980 s in the locus of collective bargaining, often from a national level or multi...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] While {{the ways}} in which {{neoliberalism}} and economic integration undermine social partnership and the welfare state have been extensively studied, less attention has been given to {{the ways in}} which such economic forces may push actors together, in reinvigorated bargaining relationships, to find workable solutions to difficult problems. In his article, we examine the contemporary status of social partnership in four case study countries—Germany, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Poland—as well as for Europe as a whole. In the west, while Germany presents a case of established social partnership under pressure, the United Kingdom has stood over the past two decades on the opposite neoliberal side. In the east, Bulgaria is one of the more developed cases of post-communist <b>tripartism,</b> while Poland exemplifies a weaker <b>tripartism</b> that emerged at a later stage of the transformation process. In selecting more and less developed social partnership cases in both west and east, we test the argument that the rise of Thatcher/Reagan/ Friedman ‘free market economics’ is paradoxically driving a resurgence and consolidation of social partnership relations across the new (both western and eastern) Europe...|$|E

To do this, NGOs need to be authorised and incentivised to take part.

Why did these experiments largely fail to achieve the gains for labour that might have been anticipated? In each case, the lack of success can be ascribed to the ecosystemic dominance of neo-liberalism, returning growth fuelled by higher commodities prices, the changing structure of elites, dominant partyism, and structural weaknesses in both organised business and the labour movement...|$|E
