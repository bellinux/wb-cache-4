5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship has been much debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E

5|$|The outer {{boundary}} of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the solar wind finally terminates and {{is the beginning of}} interstellar space. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing to competition from road haulage to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> coal deliveries were the only significant business.|$|E

5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is roughly}} middle-aged; {{it has not}} changed {{dramatically}} {{for more than four}} billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of extrasolar planets {{led to another}} ambiguity in defining a planet: <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due {{to their ability to}} fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} conditions have a considerable {{effect on the}} critical load of slender columns. The {{boundary conditions}} determine the mode of bending of the column and the distance between inflection <b>points</b> on <b>the</b> displacement curve of the deflected column. <b>The</b> inflection <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> deflection shape of the column are <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> curvature of the column changes sign and are also <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> column's internal bending moments of the column are zero. The closer <b>the</b> inflection <b>points</b> are, <b>the</b> greater the resulting axial load capacity (bucking load) of the column.|$|R

This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the Solar System {{ends and}} {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries {{are shaped by}} two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered {{the beginning of the}} interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> pressure from the solar wind {{is equal to the}} opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|This is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{explicit}} {{constitutional authority}} {{for the creation of}} federal crimes runs out. But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, bribery of federal judges, interference with judicial process, and liberation of federal prisoners. All of these were plainly necessary and proper to the operation of the federal courts; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M'Culloch v. Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} reached {{grid parity}} (<b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{the cost of}} wind power matches traditional sources) {{in some areas of}} Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and {{it has been suggested that}} it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.|$|E
5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{the leadership of the}} Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E
40|$|Publications on autism have {{exploded}} in recent years, as "Autism Spectrum Disorder" becomes {{not only a}} diagnostic category, but a cultural phenomenon.  In this piece, I review and analyze five major works on autism published between 2014 and 2016 : In A Different Key, by John Donvan and Caryn Zucker; Autism and Gender, by Jordynn Jack; War on Autism, by Anne McGuire; Uniquely Human, by Barry Prizant; and The ABCs of Autism Acceptance, by Sparrow Rose Jones.  In reviewing these works, I analyze both <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they merge and <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they diverge, and I explore {{the ways in which}} these points construct, contribute to, and/or complicate our understanding of "what autism is. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate about whether the U. S. Constitution {{includes}} [...] or should be interpreted to include [...] a principle of 2 ̆ 2 church autonomy. 2 ̆ 2 Catholic doctrine and political theology, by contrast, clearly articulated a principle of 2 ̆ 2 libertas ecclesiae, 2 ̆ 2 liberty of the church, when during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries the Church differentiated herself from the state. This article explores the meaning and origin of the doctrine of the libertas ecclesiae and the proper relationship among churches, civil society, and government. In doing so, it highlights <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> church and state should cooperate and <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> mutual assistance would be ultra vires...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the closure}} of the tramway allowed {{planning}} to go ahead for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line's construction competed with a proposal to electrify the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the line would connect to the main line. Two early proposals to join the line at Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would connect with the main line at the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussion}} continued, {{the battalion}} was {{withdrawn from the}} front lines, leaving Task Force Wahl on 23 January. It returned to 12th Armored Division, where three platoons were committed to combat to support the fighting in the Colmar Pocket {{in the first week}} of February. The remainder of the battalion was kept in reserve, where the disciplinary problems, including assaults on civilians, grew to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the commander had to request outside assistance to restore control on 5 February. The battalion was removed from its attachment to the 12th Armored on 12 February—by request of the divisional command—and withdrawn to the rear area of XV Corps to take up guard duties.|$|E
5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley {{on the western side}} of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E
