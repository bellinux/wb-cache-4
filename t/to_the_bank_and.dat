5|$|On 7 February 1934, Whittle {{was walking}} through University Park {{when he was}} accosted by a small boy who said that his younger brother {{had fallen into the}} lake. Rushing to the area, Whittle dived into the weed-choked lake and began searching for the boy. Finding him unconscious, Whittle brought the boy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> applied {{artificial}} respiration for approximately half an hour; the child later came around and was taken to hospital. Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society. Whittle himself was ill for a fortnight due to swallowing some of the foul water in the ornamental lake.|$|E

Corrocher left behind an angry note condemning the damage that Calvi had done <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> its employees. Corrocher's death was ruled a suicide.|$|E

25|$|Banks have demand {{deposits}} {{in the nature}} of loans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> investment deposits. Some offer guaranteed savings accounts with permission to use the funds and a discretionary reward to the depositor {{as in the case of}} the Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad. Initially, demand deposit accounts were more common, but over time, most accounts are now investment accounts, which reflects the confidence of depositors in the ability of banks to generate a return. Islamic banking operations are successfully operating in many Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Iran, Sudan, Turkey and Bahrain.|$|E
25|$|The Mercantile National Bank Building was {{completed}} in 1942 and was the only major skyscraper constructed during World War II. The U.S. government had called for a halt of private construction to fuel supply materials for the war effort. However, most of the tower's steel had been prefabricated and was given a special waiver from the government. The bank lobby Art Deco wood murals were {{the largest in the}} world at the time. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> other offices, the federal government took 10 floors to hold offices for various war agencies. Mercantile Bank owner and founder Robert L. Thornton constructed his own penthouse level in the upper floors.|$|E
25|$|Once the Federal fleet {{had passed}} out of range, Louisiana had no further part in the action. Her fate was {{henceforth}} tied {{to that of the}} forts, which prepared for an expected attack by the Union army accompanying the fleet, led by Major General Benjamin Butler. However, on the night of 28 April, the enlisted men in Fort Jackson mutinied and forced the surrender of both forts to Commander Porter. The naval officers on Louisiana were not consulted {{at any time during the}} negotiations between Porter and General Duncan, so they considered themselves not bound to respect the truce declared by the two sides. While discussions of terms were going on, they decided not to let their ship fall into enemy hands. Louisiana was set afire, and her crew went ashore. The flames soon parted the lines that held her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> she drifted down the river. When she was nearly abreast of Fort St. Philip, the fire reached her magazine, and she blew up with a blast that killed a soldier there.|$|E

25|$|For {{several decades}} after the Constitution was ratified, the {{interpretation}} of the Necessary and Proper Clause continued to be a powerful bone of contention between the Democratic-Republican Party and the Federalist Party, and several other political parties in the United States. The first practical example of this contention came in 1791, when Hamilton used the clause to defend the constitutionality of the creation of the First Bank of the United States, the first federal bank in the new nation's history. Concerned that monied Northern aristocrats would take advantage of the bank to exploit the South, Madison argued that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to charter a bank. Hamilton countered that the bank was a reasonable means of carrying out powers related to taxation and the borrowing of funds, claiming the clause applied to activities reasonably related to constitutional powers, not just those that were absolutely necessary to carry out said powers. To embarrass Madison, his contrary claims from The Federalist Papers were read aloud in Congress: Eventually, Southern opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> to Hamilton's plan to have the federal government assume the war debts of the states was mollified by the transfer of the nation's capital from its temporary seat in Philadelphia to a more southerly permanent seat on the Potomac, and the bill, along with the establishment of a national mint, was passed by Congress and signed by President Washington.|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was on the way}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm on the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E

[...] The Dark Blues passed under Barnes Bridge with a two-length lead and completed the course, passing the Ship Tavern three lengths clear in a time of 20 minutes 4 seconds. [...] It was their ninth consecutive victory and took the overall record to 1610 in their favour. [...] The winning time was the fastest ever, beating the previous record set in 1868 by 52 seconds, although some doubt was cast over the positioning of the finish which was believed to have made the course approximately [...] shorter.

500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost, but a {{surviving}} synopsis {{of the film}} {{was published in the}} The Moving Picture World on June 11, 1910. It states: [...] "Turner, a man of bad character, conducts an inn in the country. His stepdaughter Grace is his trudge. When on an errand to the village she meets Jack, wealthy young man. He is much attracted by her. Jack goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> draws a large sum of money. Hank, a pal of Turner, sees him and tries to ambush him on the road, but fails. Then he goes ahead to tell Turner. Jack, on his trip, meets Grace. Nearly exhausted, he takes her home, and thus seems to play directly {{into the hands of the}} villains. They steal his revolver, and would drug him, were it not for the fact that Grace writes a warning on the wall with wine. Jack, aided by Grace, escapes but the girl is wounded. Jack marries Grace." ...|$|E
500|$|Their sampan {{was soon}} spotted by North Vietnamese troops, {{some of whom}} fired at them, but Norris and Nguyen {{could not afford to}} return fire. They paddled furiously, using the current and dense foliage along {{the far side of the}} river to their advantage, and trying to out-distance the soldiers. However, when they rounded a bend in the river, the NVA fired on them with a heavy caliber machine gun. They pulled the sampan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> turned it over to provide some cover. Icke in Bilk 11 {{overhead}} called in air support and five U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawks led by Lt. Denny Sapp from the carrier Hancock killed a number of North Vietnamese troops and provided cover for his final escape. Two A-1 Skyraiders also assisted, dropping both explosives and MK47 smoke bombs, providing a smokescreen. Returning to the river, the three men were soon able to receive support from South Vietnamese forces. Landing on the river bank, they were met by some ARVN soldiers. Hambleton was unable to walk and they carried him back to their bunker. There, an M113 armored personnel carrier carried Hambleton, Norris and Nguyen back to Brigade Headquarters in Dong Ha.|$|E

2500|$|The bank lobbied to {{have its}} charter extended, but the Democrats and Free Bankers who {{controlled}} the General Assembly refused. The bank charter expired in January 1857, but the bank was permitted to continue operating until 1859 to help exchange the bank's currency for notes from the new national bank. Governor Joseph A. Wright was bitterly opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> the extension of its charter. Before the bill was passed {{he went to the}} House of Representatives to personally deliver a speech indicting the bank for [...] "corruption and fraud", and alluded that the bank bribed members of the assembly {{to have its}} charter extended. Despite his speech and veto of the bill, the General Assembly passed the act with a super-majority.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the manager}} had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> {{asked him how}} much money they had. Living {{admitted}} to between £600 and £700. Living then handed him the teller's cash, £691. Kelly asked if they had more money, and Living answered [...] "No." [...] Kelly tried to open the safe's treasure drawer, and one of the keys was given to him; but he needed the second key. Byrne wanted to break it open with a sledgehammer, but Kelly got the key from the teller and found £1650, making for a total of £2141 stolen from the bank. Kelly noticed a deed-box. The group then went to the hotel where Kelly burned three or four bank books containing mortgage documents, in an effort to erase the debts and create losses for the banks, though not realizing that some had copies held by the titles office in Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|During the Regency he made {{large amounts}} of money by speculating in the {{financial}} Système (1716–20) of John Law. He bought paper notes, waited for their value to rise, then, before the Système failed in 1720, took them to Law's bank (which had become the national bank) and traded them in for gold. On 3 March 1720, following the example of the Prince de Conti who the day before had gone to Law's bank and withdrawn fourteen million livres in gold in several large carts, Bourbon went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> took away twenty-five million. The bank closed later that year due to lack of reserves. Bourbon made 40 million livres off the Système, or perhaps 20 million. Historian James Breck Perkins says, [...] "he asked enormous advantages in return for the protection he extended , and the unfortunate adventurer [...] was {{not in a position to}} say no to so powerful a nobleman." [...] After the Système went under, [...] "the government compelled some humbler speculators to disgorge their gains, but no one ventured to disturb the head of the house of Condé." ...|$|E
