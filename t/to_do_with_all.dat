500|$|By this time, the UKAEA {{employed}} some 40,000 {{people in}} offices, laboratories and factories scattered around Britain. Gowing {{knew little about}} atomic energy; she once remarked {{that when she was}} appointed, she [...] "didn't know an atom from a molecule". [...] This was rectified, and she won the respect of Sir Christopher Hinton and Sir James Chadwick, and became friends with Nicholas Kurti, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Niels Bohr. At one point she asked Chadwick what he intended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the documents in wooden filing cabinets in his attic, and he just said [...] "burn them". Such heart-stopping moments led her to help establish the Centre for Scientific Archives in 1972.|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What are they going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} Paige's first full studio album of new {{recordings}} in 12years was marked in 2006, titled Essential Musicals. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that [...] "there's been nothing that I've wanted to do, and if you're going to commit to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it's got to be something that you want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> your heart". [...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E
2500|$|The epithet Shouters was {{introduced}} in the early 1980s by the Three Self Patriotic Movement in Jeijing Province to suppress LC activity (as they sought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> Christian groups who refused to join their movement). Over time the name Shouters has morphed in its usage by many Chinese to refer to all members of unregistered house churches, while still others use it to identify a small renegade group of people who claim to be followers of Witness Lee but have broken fellowship with the LC and distort the Bible and Lee’s teachings in numerous cultic ways. The misidentification of the LC with this latter group of [...] "Shouters" [...] has plagued the LC in its dealings with the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{voyage to}} Europe {{was made in}} January 1876. Pausing in London {{long enough to see}} Queen Victoria open Parliament in person for the first time after the Prince Consort's death, she hastened through Paris on her way to Rome to view old palaces, gardens, and galleries, touched to tears by Pope Pius IX's benediction, enjoying the {{hospitality}} of the studios of Elihu Vedder, John Rollin Tilton, and others, and of the gracious and charming social life of Rome. Her descriptions of all this, overflowing with the sensitiveness to beauty which was a part of her nature, made her Random Rambles interesting reading. After Rome, she visited Florence, and then Venice, and then again Paris, and again London and the London season. Entertained by Lord Houghton, she met Robert Browning and Algernon Charles Swinburne, George Eliot, Alexander William Kinglake, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and others, seeing especially a great deal of Browning who said, [...] "Her voice, wherein all sweetnesses abide," [...] having as much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> this as her literary excellence.|$|E
