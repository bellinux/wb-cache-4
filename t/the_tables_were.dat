Manson displayed a much more cautious ring style upon his return.|$|E
25|$|The Oilers and Jets both {{started their}} {{existence}} in the World Hockey Association in 1972. There, the Jets dominated the Oilers winning the Avco Cup three times, while the Oilers were not playoff contenders. But, when they joined the NHL in 1979 (along with the Quebec Nordiques and Hartford Whalers), <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> turned, thanks to an 18-year-old from Brantford, Ontario named Wayne Gretzky. From 1983 to 1989, the Oilers and Jets met in the playoffs five times, the Oilers won every one of them, losing only one game out of the 19 games played between the two {{on their way to}} the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988; with the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup in the latter four years. Gretzky had been traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the time the two teams met in the first round of the 1990 playoffs. The Jets took a commanding three games to one series lead, and led Game 5 by that same margin. Eventually, the Oilers fought back to win the next three games and the series in seven. The Oilers would lose just three more games the remainder of the playoffs, en route to their fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven years. The rivalry ended in 1996 when the original Jets left Winnipeg to become the Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E
25|$|John Scott Haldane {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} half times to model the uptake and release of nitrogen into the blood. He suggested 5 tissue compartments with half times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 75 minutes. In this early hypothesis {{it was predicted that}} if the ascent rate does not allow the inert gas partial pressure in each of the hypothetical tissues to exceed the environmental pressure by more than 2:1 bubbles will not form. Basically this meant that one could ascend from 30m (4 bar) to 10m (2 bar), or from 10m (2 bar) to the surface (1 bar) when saturated, without a decompression problem. To ensure this a number of decompression stops were incorporated into the ascent schedules. The ascent rate and the fastest tissue in the model determine the time and depth of the first stop. Thereafter the slower tissues determine when it is safe to ascend further. This 2:1 ratio was found to be too conservative for fast tissues (short dives) and not conservative enough for slow tissues (long dives). The ratio also seemed to vary with depth. Haldane's approach to decompression modeling was used from 1908 to the 1960s with minor modifications, primarily changes to the number of compartments and half times used. The 1937 US Navy tables were based on research by O. D. Yarbrough and used 3 compartments: the 5- and 10-minute compartments were dropped. In the 1950s <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> revised and the 5- and 10-minute compartments restored, and a 120-minute compartment added.|$|E

25|$|Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion {{cannot be}} solved by the lunar-four {{arguments}} that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact 5458/5923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (Almagest 6.9) his 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 B. C. E. to find the less accurate ratio 7160 synodic months = 7770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic months = 269 anomalistic months.) If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a moonrise 1245 B. C. E. eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13645 synodic months = 148807 1/2 draconitic months ≈ 14623 1/2 anomalistic months. Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely. The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself {{and there is no}} consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 B. C. E., 600 years before his era, <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> actually good back to before the eclipse in question because as only recently noted their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia opened interleague {{play against}} the Boston Red Sox on May 21, {{defeating}} them, 5–1; J. C. Romero collected his second save {{of the season}} to close Hamels' fifth victory, and Werth {{hit a home run}} to the second deck in left field. Boston's Daisuke Matsuzaka nearly no-hit the Phillies in the second game until Juan Castro singled with two outs in the eighth inning; it was Philadelphia's only hit of the game, as they were defeated, 5–0. The Red Sox took the final game, 8–3, by scoring six earned runs against Halladay, his second consecutive loss and the most runs allowed in a start by the right-hander so far during the season. Traveling to New York for their second series against the Mets, the Phillies were shut out in consecutive games: 8–0 on May 25 by knuckleballer R. A. Dickey; and 5–0 on May 26 by Hisanori Takahashi. Philadelphia was held scoreless for 37 of 38 consecutive innings, with the only runs coming in the final inning of the last game against Boston, and increased that total to 46 of 47 after being shut out again in the final game of the series, 3–0; the Phillies became the first defending league champion in Major League Baseball history not to score a run in a three-game series. It was the first time Philadelphia was shut out in three consecutive games since 1983, the season that they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. The streak ended at 30 consecutive innings (49 of 50) when the Phillies scored in the fourth inning of the May 28 contest to open the Memorial Day weekend series with Florida; they defeated the Marlins, 3–2, after taking their first lead in a game in a week. Philadelphia completed its second consecutive victory in a pitcher's duel between Halladay and Marlins ace Josh Johnson; Johnson allowed only an unearned run through seven innings, but Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in major league history, and the second in franchise history (Jim Bunning), striking out 11 and retiring all 27 Florida batters in order. <b>The</b> <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> turned the following afternoon as the Marlins shut out the Phillies, 1–0, behind Aníbal Sánchez, and the month was finished with a 9–3 loss to Atlanta.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, the French {{government}} funded {{a research}} project {{for the evaluation of}} the MT74 tables using computer analysis of the dive report database, which indicated that the MT74 tables had limitations for severe exposures. The government then supported a second project to develop and validate new tables. A complete set of air tables, with options of pure oxygen breathing at 6m (surface supplied), at 12m (wet bell), surface decompression, split level diving, repetitive diving, etc. was developed in 1983. This early model already implemented the concept of continuous compartment half-times. For the safe ascent criteria, the Arterial Bubble model was not derived mathematically, but an approximation was defined empirically by fitting mathematical expressions to selected exposures from the Comex database. At the time, the best fit was obtained by the expression now called AB Model-1, which was used to compute a set of decompression tables that was evaluated offshore on selected Comex worksites. In 1986, after some minor adjustments, <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> included in the Comex diving manuals and used as standard procedures.

The other was designed for closed bell bounce diving and allowed for exposures up to 120 minutes, and depths to 120m. The diver breathed heliox {{in the water and}} in the bell, air after transfer into the deck decompression chamber, and finally oxygen on built in breathing system (BIBS) from 12m to the surface. These tables produced a relatively high incidence of decompression sickness.|$|E

500|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Spanish in 1519, <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> turned on the Nahuatl language: it was {{displaced}} as the dominant regional language, but remained important in Nahua communities under Spanish rule. There is extensive colonial-era documentation in Nahuatl for Tlaxcala, Cuernavaca, Culhuacan, Coyoacan, Toluca and others in the Valley of Mexico and beyond. [...] Since the 1970s, scholars working in a branch of Mesoamerican ethnohistory known as the New Philology have translated to English and analyzed a great number of this type of documentation. Since the Spanish made alliances with first the Nahuatl speakers from Tlaxcala and later with the conquered Mexica of Tenochtitlan or Aztecs, the Nahuatl language continued spreading throughout Mesoamerica in the decades after the conquest. Spanish expeditions with thousands of Nahua soldiers marched north and south to conquer new territories. Society of Jesus missions in northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States often included a barrio of Tlaxcaltec soldiers who remained to guard the mission. For example, some fourteen years after the northeastern city of Saltillo was founded in 1577, a Tlaxcaltec community was resettled in a separate nearby village, San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala, to cultivate the land and aid colonization efforts that had stalled in the face of local hostility to the Spanish settlement. As for the conquest of modern-day Central America, Pedro de Alvarado conquered Guatemala with the help {{of tens of thousands of}} Tlaxcaltec allies, who then settled outside of modern-day Antigua Guatemala.|$|E
