[...] She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes {{back to the beginning of}} the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the [...] "texture and color" [...] of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2016, Andra Day {{received}} the Powerhouse Award at the Billboard Women in Music event. When asked {{what makes a}} 'powerhouse' powerful to others, Day responded, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> remind them of their value, you remind them of their purpose. You remind them {{that you are not}} here just to exist, you're here to impact people in their lives...I think it just reinforces that." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Martyn Percy of the Lincoln Theological Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, an {{authority}} on new religious movements, commented on the organisation's nature of control: [...] "It {{seems to me to}} be a fascinating form of religious control exercised on people. If you really think people know what you <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> don’t dare step out of line. It becomes intolerable. What is absolutely unique about this church is a woman being not just a figurehead, but the prophetic leader of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Linz {{claims he}} did not hear exactly what his manager said, and asked Mickey Mantle, seated a few rows further forward, to repeat it. Mantle, who often played little jokes on his teammates, told Linz that Berra {{had asked him to}} play it louder, which Linz did. This in turn led Berra to get out of his seat and go {{to the back of the}} bus, {{supposedly}} yelling at Linz to [...] "shove it up your ass!

5000|$|Blur's {{previous}} studio album, Blur (1997), {{had seen}} the band {{move away from the}} Britpop movement and take on a more Indie rock influenced direction, primarily under the suggestion of guitarist Graham Coxon. The press and the industry had feared that the change in style would not be taken well with the public, and therefore the album would be commercially unsuccessful as a result. Despite these concerns, Blur had become an unexpected success, particularly in America, where the album had been certified Gold. However, the band still wanted to innovate, so they decided to embrace a different sound. Bassist Alex James stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to keep changing. That sort of thinking was, sort of, key." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{with most}} Johnson songs, [...] "Stop Breakin' Down Blues" [...] failed to {{generate}} much interest with the blues record buying public {{when it was}} released. However, his work was kept alive by a [...] "small circle of Mississippi peers" [...] with interpretations recorded by other blues artists. In 1945, Sonny Boy Williamson I recorded his version as an early Chicago blues with Big Maceo (piano), Tampa Red (guitar), and Charles Sanders (drums) (RCA Victor 20-3047). Titled [...] "Stop Breaking Down", the song featured somewhat different lyrics, including the refrain [...] "I don't believe you really really love me, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> like the way my music sounds" [...] in place of Johnson's [...] "The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind". Williamson's song inspired the versions sung [...] "by most postwar Chicago blues artists".|$|E

5000|$|Lennon's lead guitar {{work on the}} track, {{which he}} {{recorded}} on 4 December 1980, was his final creative act. [...] He used his famous Beatles era 1958 Rickenbacker 325 to record all the guitar parts. This {{is the first time}} that he used the guitar on a studio recording since 1964/65. At the end of January 1981, [...] "Walking on Thin Ice" [...] was released as a single and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at number 58 in the US and gaining major club/underground airplay. The single was released in February 1981 in the UK and reached number 35 on the chart. The critical reception was favorable: NME rated it in the best tracks of year 1981 at number 10. The lyrics talk of the unpredictability of life and death [...] - [...] of [...] "throwing the dice in the air" [...] - [...] and reach the conclusion, [...] "when our hearts return to ashes, it will be just a story....". On the version included on 1992's Onobox, a new intro was added, where John Lennon can be heard remarking [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> cut your first number one, Yoko." ...|$|E

The news brought mixed {{feedback from}} fans; Wilson is purported to have expressed through his Facebook page: [...] "It kind of bums {{me out to}} see some of the negativity here about the album I've been working so hard on. In my life in music, I’ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it’s my job to do that - and I think I’ve earned that right ... So let’s just wait until the album comes out because I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> might dig it as much as I do." [...] Thomas has asserted: [...] "Brian isn’t trying to write to a younger or older audience, he’s telling the story from his perspective." [...] Later, a guest appearance by Nate Ruess of Fun was also confirmed, and that Ocean's collaboration would be excluded, replaced by a remake of the Beach Boys' 1965 instrumental [...] "Summer Means New Love".|$|E
5000|$|Linda Stasi of New York Post {{gave the}} series a 3.5/4. Stasi wrote [...] "so smart, so unexpected, so {{entertaining}} {{and yet so}} informative that you might <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> stepped back in time 20 years". Matt Roush of TV Guide gave it a moderate review, stating [...] "Substantive without being stuffy, workmanlike but something less than a wow. Nothing cheesy or sleazy, But nothing really electrifying happened, either.". James Poniewozik of Time also gave a moderate, general review, paying particular attention to a closing segment with Jon Stewart of The Daily Show. [...] "Rock Center {{may not be a}} ratings smash, and not all its experiments may work. But the good news is, Williams and Stewart can both keep their day jobs.". Hank Stuever of Washington Post gave a positive review, saying [...] "The result was assured, quick-paced and enjoyably flavored with a few spicy dashes of Brian Williams' dry rub." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times gave it a general, neutral review. Stanley said [...] "Rock Center is still a work in progress, so it’s hard to judge how it will fare. But it’s already clear that Mr. Williams wasn’t chosen to host it because of his stature as a news anchor. Mostly, he is there to draw viewers who {{think of him as a}} funny TV personality who sometimes moonlights delivering the news.".|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are not a}} {{scarecrow}} at all!" [...] {{she said}} indignantly. [...] "Why do you say such things of yourself? Of course you are thin, very thin, but even now you look nice.

5000|$|Sharapova's next tournament was {{the first}} major of the year, the Australian Open, an event she had {{previously}} won in 2008. She was seeded third and was defending heavy points from the previous years semifinal, which she lost in straight sets to Li Na.

She then faced Italian Karin Knapp in the second round and ultimately won 6-4, 4-6, 10-8, in a match that lasted for almost three and a half hours.

Sharapova later played down the complaints stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> get numb to heat, it just doesn't faze you any more. I'm happy - these are the matches that you work for." [...] Next, Sharapova had a much easier time in the third round, defeating French 25th seed Alizé Cornet in straight sets 6-1, 7-6.
