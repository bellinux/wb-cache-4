5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> crooked, steel beams <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E

5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Cray {{had always}} {{attacked}} {{the problem of}} increased speed with three simultaneous advances; more execution units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components {{to allow for a}} higher clock speed. Of the three, Cray was normally least aggressive on the last; his designs tended to use components <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> in widespread use, as opposed to leading-edge designs.|$|E
5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan {{was that the}} Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia {{since the beginning of the}} Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian Democratic Union on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> founded.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E

5|$|Marseillois {{was ordered}} on 16 January 1762, {{to be built}} in Toulon on a design by the {{engineer}} Coulomb, and named the same day by Louis XV, following the request of her patrons. The chamber of commerce of Marseille further requested that the ship be built in Marseille, but Coulomb determined that the harbour there was too shallow for the launch of a 74-gun ship, and the order for Marseillois was eventually confirmed at Toulon. There, lack of timber in the shipyards, <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> busy building Languedoc, Zélé and Bourgogne, delayed the construction of Marseillois until 1764. Her building was directed by the engineer Chapelle.|$|E
5|$|Mounseer Nongtongpaw was {{originally}} published by William Godwin's publishing firm, M. J. Godwin, in 1808 {{as part of}} its Juvenile Library series. English editions have been located for 1811, 1812, 1823, and 1830 and Philadelphia editions have been located for 1814 and c. 1824. The original edition was illustrated by a protégé of Godwin, William Mulready. Shelley biographer Emily Sunstein speculates that some of the verses may have been written to match illustrations <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> designed. The copper plate engravings are reproduced in Peter and Iona Opie's Nursery Companion.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> on the market at that time.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game {{developers}} and publishers wanted to contribute the video game library. The NES, at its peak, controlled 90% of the 8-bit market in the United States. Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from two sources to better capitalize on the growing industry. The first strategy was to take games <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1997, the W3C {{approved}} Yggdrasil {{to coordinate}} future development of Arena. Development {{was taken over}} by Yggdrasil, with the idea to turn Arena into an open source X Window System browser licensed under the GNU General Public License. Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries. Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> available in the previous title.|$|E

5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and {{the lack}} of any {{suitable}} place for aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required a number of features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would not interfere with stations <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also necessary to keep OTUs as far away from enemy airspace as possible, while the sensitive airspace over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E
5|$|The Cayman Islands were {{expected}} to suffer badly if Hurricane Dean passed too close, and mandatory evacuations were instigated for the low-lying Little Cayman. Tourists were forbidden from entering the island and extra flights were added to evacuate those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> there. Schools and civic centers were converted to shelters on Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, and, despite the mandatory evacuation, one shelter was opened on Little Cayman for the residents who remained there. Expecting catastrophic damage, two Royal Navy ships of the Atlantic Patrol Task (North), HMS Portland and RFA Wave Ruler, followed 150mi (240km) behind the storm in order to arrive at Cayman as soon after the hurricane as possible.|$|E
5|$|The United States trade dollar was {{a dollar}} coin minted by the United States Mint {{to compete with}} other large silver trade coins <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> popular in East Asia. The idea first came about in the 1860s, {{when the price of}} silver began to decline due to {{increased}} mining efforts in the western United States. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually put before Congress, where it was approved and later signed into law as the Coinage Act of 1873. The act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an obverse and reverse created by William Barber were selected.|$|E
