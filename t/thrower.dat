The {{purpose of this}} study was to find out anthropometric measurements, body composition and somatotyping differences in high performer and low performer hammer <b>throwers.</b> 20 male hammer <b>throwers</b> of age 18 to 25 years were assessed for the study. Out of which 10 were high performers and 10 were low performers. All subjects were assessed for height, weight, widths, girths and skinfold thicknesses. The independent samples t-test revealed that high performer hammer <b>throwers</b> had significantly higher weight (p< 0. 01), sitting height (p< 0. 05), BMI (p< 0. 01) and lower leg length (p< 0. 01) as compared to low performers.

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the muscle fibre type composition and body composition of well-trained hammer <b>throwers.</b> Six experienced hammer <b>throwers</b> underwent the following measurements: one repetition maximum in squat, snatch, and clean, standing broad jump, backward overhead shot throw and the hammer throw. Dual x-ray absorptiometry was used for body composition analysis. Fibre type composition and cross sectional area was determined in muscle biopsy samples of the right vastus lateralis. Eight physical education students served as a control group. One repetition maximum in squat, snatch and clean for the hammer <b>throwers</b> was 245 ± 21, 132 ± 13 and 165 ± 12 kg, respectively. Lean body mass was higher in hammer <b>throwers</b> (85. 9 ± 3. 9 kg vs. 62. 7 ± 5. 1 kg (p < 0. 01). The percentage area of type II muscle fibres was 66. 1 ± 4 % in hammer <b>throwers</b> and 51 ± 8 % in the control group (p < 0. 05). Hammer <b>throwers</b> had significantly larger type IIA fibres (7703 ± 1171 vs. 5676 ± 1270 μm 2, p < 0. 01).

5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the <b>thrower</b> releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
