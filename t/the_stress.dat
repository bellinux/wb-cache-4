5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on <b>the</b> <b>stress),</b> but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E
