5000|$|Chumakov {{graduated}} in 1931 from Moscow State University Medical School {{that was later}} transformed into I.M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy. In 1937 Chumakov participated in a scientific expedition to Khabarovsk region of Soviet Far East that was led by Professor Lev A. Zilber. Together with his colleagues he discovered the etiology of a new transmissible neurological disease called <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (<b>TBE)</b> and isolated {{the virus that causes}} it. He was accidentally infected with the virus and developed encephalitis that led to a permanent loss of hearing and paralysis of the right arm. For this discovery he was awarded Stalin Prize of First Degree in Science and Technology in 1941. In 1948 Chumakov became a corresponding member, and in 1960 a full member of Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. Beginning in the 1940s Chumakov organized multiple medical expeditions to Siberia and other regions of the Soviet Union to investigate outbreaks caused by new viruses. Among viruses discovered and studied by Chumakov are Omsk hemorrhagic fever and Kemerovo fever viruses, hantavirus causing renal syndrome, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, and many others. From 1950 he was the Director of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow. In 1952 {{as a part of the}} anti-Semitic campaign in the Soviet Union known as Doctors' plot he was removed from the Ivanovsky Institute for refusal to fire Jewish associates. In 1955 he organized a new research institute near Moscow to work on vaccines against poliomyelitis. His work on vaccines against poliomyelitis was done in close collaboration with American scientists including Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. [...] In 1958-1959 he organized the first mass production and clinical trials of Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV) made from live attenuated strains developed by Albert Sabin. This made the Soviet Union the first country to develop, produce, license and widely use this highly effective vaccine that practically eliminated poliomyelitis from the country in the first few years of its use. The vaccine produced by Chumakov's Institute was exported into more than 60 countries, and was instrumental in stopping large outbreaks of poliomyelitis in Eastern Europe and Japan. The success of the Russian clinical trials was critical to OPV licensing in the United States in 1962, and the vaccine becoming the main tool used in global poliomyelitis eradication campaign. Chumakov also created a number of other human and veterinarian vaccines, including inactivated vaccine against TBE, measles, influenza and vaccine against Canine distemper virus that is widely used to protect farmed fur animals. Chumakov published more than 960 research papers, scholarly articles and books.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> or <b>TBE,</b> {{is a human}} viral {{infectious}} disease involving the central nervous system. TBE {{is caused by the}} tick- borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), {{a member of the family}} Flaviviridae, and was initially isolated in 1937. Three virus sub-types are described: European or Western <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, Siberian <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, and Far eastern <b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (formerly known as Russian Spring Summer encephalitis virus, RSSEV). The family Flaviviridae includes several tick-borne viruses affecting humans. These viruses are closely related to TBEV and Far- eastern TBE, and include Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus in Siberia, Kyasanur Forest disease virus in India and its close relative, Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia. Louping ill virus (United Kingdom) is also a member of this family; it causes disease primarily in sheep and has been reported as the cause of a TBE-like illness in laboratory workers and persons with contact to sick sheep (e. g., veterinarians, butchers).

40|$|Introduction: In {{the year}} 2013, we are celebrating the 60 th {{anniversary of the}} {{isolation}} of the <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (<b>TBE)</b> in Slovenia. Ever since its isolation, Slovenian infectologists, epidemiologists, virologists and other experts have been researching this disease. Methods: For this anniversary, we have historiographically analysed all qualified articles from this period and prepared a retrospective study of the appearance of the disease in Slovenia. Results: In certain parts of Slovenia, in the years following the Second World War, there was an increased presence of previously unknown diseases of the central nervous system. In 1953, Milko Bedjanič, Slava Rus and Jelka Vesenjak Zmijanac isolated a virus in the blood and thereby proved that the disease was indeed TBE. In the years that followed, virologists studied the cause of TBE, many epidemiologists researched its epidemic characteristics, entomologists and ornithologists studied the ecosystems of arboviral infections and infectologists studied the clinical and laboratory features of infections and the course of the disease as well as its possible consequences. Microbiologists perfected the technique of diagnosing this infection. They developed a vaccine and selected the groups that were legally obliged to be vaccinated. Conclusion: the disease has stabilised as an endemic type of TBE that clinicians can control, but the common effort of epidemiologists and the public health service directed towards vaccinating people against this disease has not been very successful and the disease is still too common...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the vertebrate host of <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (<b>TBE)</b> virus {{in the southern}} part of Hokkaido, Japan, virus isolation was performed using spleens from small mammals captured in the area. Two virus strains were isolated, one strain from Apodemus speciosus and another from Clethrionomys rufocanus. Virus isolates were inoc-ulated onto baby hamster kidney cell monolayers and antigen slides were prepared for an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay. Two isolates were identified as TBE viruses by monoclonal antibody reactions. To specify the TBE-endemic area in Hokkaido, rodent, horse, and dog sera collected from 1992 to 1997 were tested for neutralization antibody against TBE virus previously isolated from a dog. The positive cases were distributed in four districts {{in the southern part}} of Hokkaido. <b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (<b>TBE)</b> virus is one of the most important flaviviruses causing severe illness in humans.
