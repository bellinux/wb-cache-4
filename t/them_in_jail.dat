25|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of violence}} in slums is armed violence (gun violence), mostly existing in African and Latin American slums. It leads to homicide {{and the emergence of}} criminal gangs. Typical victims are male slum residents. Violence often leads to retaliatory and vigilante violence within the slum. Gang and drug wars are endemic in some slums, predominantly between male residents of slums. The police sometimes participate in gender-based violence against men as well by picking up some men, beating them and putting <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> Domestic violence against men also exists in slums, including verbal abuses and even physical violence from households.|$|E

25|$|In 1820, {{four years}} after the Congress had named Francia {{dictator}} for life with the title Supremo Dictator Perpetuo de la Republica del Paraguay (Supreme Dictator in Perpetuity), Francia's security system uncovered and quickly crushed a plot by the élite to assassinate El Supremo. Francia arrested almost 200 prominent Paraguayans among whom were all the leading figures of the 1811 independence movement, and executed most of them. In 1821 Francia struck against the Spanish-born elite, summoning all of Paraguay's 300 or so peninsulares to Asunción's main square, where he accused them of treason, had them arrested, and held <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for 18 months.

2500|$|Lee {{tried to}} hire an {{overseer}} to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, [...] "I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate & kind to the negroes, will be firm & make them do their duty." [...] But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and {{had to take a}} two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself. He found the experience frustrating, since many of the slaves had been given to understand that they were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay. In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, [...] "I have had some trouble with some of the people. Reuben, Parks & Edward, {{in the beginning of the}} previous week, rebelled against my authority—refused to obey my orders, & said they were as free as I was, etc., etc.—I succeeded in capturing them & lodging <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> They resisted till overpowered & called upon the other people to rescue them."

2500|$|In March 1942, {{with the}} Japanese fast {{moving up the}} Malayan Peninsula after the Fall of Singapore, and with the Americans {{supporting}} independence for India, Winston Churchill, the wartime Prime Minister of Britain, sent Sir Stafford Cripps, {{the leader of the}} House of Commons, with an offer of dominion status to India {{at the end of the}} war in return for the Congress's support for the war effort. Not wishing to lose the support of the allies they had already secured—the Muslim League, Unionists of the Punjab, and the Princes—the Cripps offer included a clause stating that no part of the British Indian Empire would be forced to join the post-war Dominion. As a result of the proviso, the proposals were rejected by the Congress, which, since its founding as a polite group of lawyers in 1885, saw itself as the representative of all Indians of all faiths. After the arrival in 1920 of Gandhi, the preeminent strategist of Indian nationalism, the Congress had been transformed into a mass nationalist movement of millions. In August 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India Resolution which asked for drastic constitutional changes, which the British saw as the most serious threat to their rule since the Indian rebellion of 1857. With their resources and attention already spread thin by a global war, the nervous British immediately jailed the Congress leaders and kept <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> until August 1945, whereas the Muslim League was now free for the next three years to spread its message. Consequently, the Muslim League's ranks surged during the war, with Jinnah himself admitting, [...] "The war which nobody welcomed proved to be a blessing in disguise." [...] Although there were other important national Muslim politicians such as Congress leader Abul Kalam Azad, and influential regional Muslim politicians such as A. K. Fazlul Huq of the leftist Krishak Praja Party in Bengal, Sikander Hyat Khan of the landlord-dominated Punjab Unionist Party, and Abd al-Ghaffar Khan of the pro-Congress Khudai Khidmatgar (popularly, [...] "red shirts") in the North West Frontier Province, the British were to increasingly see the League as the main representative of Muslim India. The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan pitted it against the British and Congress.|$|E

60|$|You know (though I didn't, till Aristides {{explained}} to me) {{that in any}} European country the captain {{in such a case}} would go to his consul, and the consul would go to the police, and the police would run the men down and send them back to the ship in irons as deserters, or put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> till the captain was ready to sail, and then deliver them up to him. But it seems that there is no law in Altruria to do anything of the kind; the only law here that would touch the case is one which obliges any citizen to appear and answer the complaint of any other citizen before the Justiciary Assembly. A citizen cannot be imprisoned for anything but the rarest offence, like killing a person in a fit of passion; and as to seizing upon men who are guilty of nothing worse than wanting to be left to the pursuit of happiness, as all the Altrurians are, there is no statute and no usage for it. Aristides says that the only thing which can be done is to ask the captain and the men to come to the Assembly and each state his case. The Altrurians are not anxious to have the men stay, not merely because they are coarse, rude, or vicious, but because they think they ought to go home and tell the Americans what they have seen and heard here, and try and get them to found an Altrurian Commonwealth of their own. Still they will not compel them to go, and the magistrates do not wish to rouse any sort of sentiment against them. They feel that the men are standing on their natural rights, which they could not abdicate if they would. I know this will appear perfectly ridiculous to Mr. Makely, and I confess myself that there seems something binding in a contract which ought to act on the men's consciences, at least.|$|E
