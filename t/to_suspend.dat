5|$|In the off-season, Ottawa's {{president}} Llewellyn Bate proposed <b>to</b> <b>suspend</b> the team's operations {{until the}} end of the war. Gate receipts had declined 17 per cent. The other NHA owners refused <b>to</b> <b>suspend</b> the league. Rather than simply cease operations, Bate and the other directors of the team turned it over to Ted Dey, owner of the Arena. Dey cut player salaries and let players go, including Art Ross to the Wanderers. Dey also fired manager Alf Smith, saving on his $750 salary.|$|E
5|$|After the season, {{the owners}} asked the NHL {{for a second}} time for {{permission}} <b>to</b> <b>suspend</b> operations. This time, the NHL refused the request. Instead, the league bought back the franchise, halted its operations, and dispersed its players among the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used in}} the building of the Fastra II computer.

The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses two poles or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress <b>to</b> <b>suspend</b> the anti-slavery {{clause of}} the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Changes {{in blood}} calcium and {{phosphorus}} concentrations were characterized for rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) following intense exercise or exposure <b>to</b> <b>suspended</b> volcanic ash or topsoil. Significant elevations in blood calcium and phosphorus accompanied exercise-induced acidemia in both S. qairdneri and O. kisutch. These elevations persisted for many hours post-exercise. Previous authors have identified bone mineral {{as the source}} of the excess calcium observed during exercise-induced hypercalcemia, but data presented herein indicates that phosphorus released into the bloodstream during exercise must have an additional, non-skeletal source. Exposure of juvenile O. kisutch <b>to</b> <b>suspended</b> Mt. St. Helens volcanic ash caused significant elevations in blood calcium and phosphorus only when fish so exposed were maintained under a regime of moderate exercise. No significant changes in blood calcium or phosphorus occurred following exposure of unexercised fish <b>to</b> <b>suspended</b> volcanic ash, nor were they elicited in exercised fish exposed to an identical level of suspended topsoil. The effects of exercise-induced hypercalcemia on the blood buffering capacity of S. gairdneri were also investigated. Results obtained in vitro suggest that dissolution products of bone hydroxyapatite may significantly diminish the in vivo blood buffering power of S. gairdneri, especially during exercise-induced acidosis...|$|R

5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having <b>to</b> <b>suspend</b> the construction.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of wind and}} water in semiarid and arid areas usually leads to low-frequency flash flood events in desert rivers, which have adverse effects on river systems and ecology. In arid zones, many aeolian dune-fields terminate in stream channels and deliver aeolian sand to the channels. Although aeolian processes are common to many desert rivers, whether the aeolian processes contribute to fluvial sediment loss is still unknown. Here, we identified the aeolian-fluvial cycling process responsible for {{the high rate of}} suspended sediment transport in the Sudalaer desert stream in the Ordos plateau of China. On the basis of element geochemistry data analysis, we found that aeolian sand was similar <b>to</b> <b>suspended</b> sediment in element composition, which suggests that aeolian sand contributes <b>to</b> <b>suspended</b> sediment in flash floods. Scatter plots of some elements further confirm that aeolian sand is the major source of the suspended sediment. Factor analysis and the relation between some elements and suspended sediment concentration prove that the greater the aeolian process, the higher the suspended sediment concentration and the greater the contribution of aeolian sand <b>to</b> <b>suspended</b> sediment yield. We conclude that aeolian sand is the greatest contributor to flash floods in the Sudalaer desert stream...|$|R
