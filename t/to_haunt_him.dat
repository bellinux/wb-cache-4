5|$|On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further {{consolidated}} {{power in}} Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the unique {{position of being}} both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat to the country of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him.</b> With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him</b> when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E

He himself {{was wounded in the}} duel, but received a written apology from his protagonist. The scandal was <b>to</b> later <b>haunt</b> <b>him</b> during his career, and is most often cited as the reason why, despite an exceptional career in the diplomatic service, he never received the customary knighthood.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the other}} notable Lords of the Manor was Sir Hugh de Morville, Lord of Westmorland. He {{was one of the}} four knights who murdered St Thomas Beckett in Canterbury cathedral, and legend says that he took refuge here {{afterwards}} before being banished to France.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{beginnings}} of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, {{he was given}} the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders). In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him.</b> The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra. In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg. Just a Gigolo (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her Gigolo Stable.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, {{the final}} season, opens with summer {{wrapping}} up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor {{as a special}} teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him,</b> it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a good look at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E
50|$|At {{about this}} time he began to develop an intense {{interest}} {{in the study of}} mental illness. The incentive was a personal one. A friend had developed a ‘nervous melancholy’ that had ‘degenerated into mania’ and resulted in suicide. What Pinel regarded as an unnecessary tragedy due to gross mismanagement seems <b>to</b> have <b>haunted</b> <b>him.</b> It led him to seek employment at one of the best-known private sanatoria for the treatment of insanity in Paris. He remained there for five years prior to the Revolution, gathering observations on insanity and beginning to formulate his views on its nature and treatment.|$|R

60|$|Without prolonging the {{narrative}} {{to dwell on}} any one of its curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the Engine-Driver included, not only the words which the unfortunate Signal-man had repeated <b>to</b> me as <b>haunting</b> <b>him,</b> but also the words which I myself--not he--had attached, and that only in my own mind, to the gesticulation he had imitated.|$|R

25|$|Brooke {{became the}} centre of {{controversy}} in 1851 when accusations against him of excessive {{use of force against}} natives, under the guise of anti-piracy operations, ultimately led to the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry in Singapore in 1854.

50|$|Fort Pulaski was {{prepared}} for a possible infantry attack. However, it never endured a direct land assault. Using 36 guns, including the new James Rifled Cannon and Parrott rifles, Union troops began the long sustained bombardment of Fort Pulaski. The rifled projectiles could be accurately fired farther (4-5 miles) than the larger and heavier smoothbore cannonballs. Within 30 hours, the new rifled cannon had breached one of the fort's corner walls. Shells now passed through the fort dangerously close to the main powder magazine. Reluctantly, Colonel Olmstead surrendered the fort. Only two soldiers, one Confederate and one Union, were injured in the attack. Olmstead's decision <b>to</b> surrender <b>haunted</b> <b>him</b> for decades.|$|R
50|$|Dieterle's {{next film}} {{would come back}} <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> both <b>him</b> and screenwriter John Howard Lawson later in life. Blockade (1938) stars Henry Fonda as a {{dedicated}} Loyalist fighter and Madeline Carroll as the reluctant Franco spy {{who falls in love}} with him during the Spanish Civil War. The film was openly anti-fascist and critical of nations that stood by and let fascist dictators commit atrocities. It was mildly controversial upon release, but would become one of the major films cited by Congressional Committees during the Hollywood Witch Hunt of the 1940s and 1950s. Its 1938 premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater was abruptly and inexplicably cancelled.|$|R

25|$|Arthur Miller’s {{writing in}} All My Sons often shows {{great respect for}} the great Greek tragedies of the likes of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. In these plays the tragic hero or protagonist will commit an offense, often unknowingly, which will return <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him,</b> {{sometimes}} many years later. The play encapsulates all {{the fallout from the}} offense into a 24-hour time span. During that day, the protagonist must learn his fate and suffer as a result, and perhaps even die. In this way the gods are shown to be just and moral order is restored.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Luchian contributed two pastels to Romania's Pavilion at the World Fair, and in {{the same}} year {{suffered}} the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis, the disease which, after some initial improvements, was <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. Nonetheless, he continued painting and, until 1915, had his works displayed in numerous exhibitions, albeit to a largely indifferent public. At his 1905 exhibition, the only buyer of a painting was his former teacher Grigorescu. Despite being appreciated by a select few (including the writer Ion Luca Caragiale), Luchian lived in poverty (the large fortune he had inherited was progressively drained).|$|E
25|$|Wallace's {{service at}} the battle of Shiloh {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him</b> in later life. The debate persisted in book publications, magazine articles, pamphlets, speeches, and in private correspondence. Wallace attended a reunion at Shiloh in 1894, his first return since 1862, and retraced his journey to the battlefield with veterans from the 3rd Division. He returned to Shiloh for a final time in 1901 to walk the battlefield with David W. Reed, the Shiloh Battlefield Commission's historian, and others. Wallace died before the manuscript of his memoirs was fully completed, so it is unknown whether he would have revised his final account of the battle.|$|E

50|$|The 1970s were a {{difficult}} decade for Frei. He found himself troubled about his {{links to the}} church. Firmly convinced theologically {{that he should have}} some kind of ecclesiastical grounding and location for his work as well as his academic setting, he nevertheless felt distanced from his adopted Anglican home, and yet committed to stay there. He found himself theologically uneasy about the places where he did feel less isolated - in particular, Quaker meetings. At the same time he found himself unable easily to call himself a theologian, particularly not a systematic theologian, and he concentrated his energies instead on the 'religious studies' (for which read 'historical') side of his work. Nevertheless, the questions he asked, the issues which interested him, the way he pursued that historical work - all were theological, and he knew it. The ambivalence seems not exactly <b>to</b> have <b>haunted</b> <b>him,</b> but at least to have been never far from his working mind.|$|R

Childhood means happiness, charm, freedom, certainty of revival. Its light and freshness reflect on the places where he spent a part of it, the modest village-Chapelle Anthenaise, in the Mayenne department. For the writer of Romanian origin and French expression, Chapelle-Anthenaise remained as a secure place, a world of miracles and surprises, a real paradise on earth. Places of childhood merged with childhood itself, the age of innocence and joy of life, symbolizing the paradise.

500|$|Sir George Ralph Collier, 1st Baronet KCB (1774 [...] 24 March 1824) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812. He had an eventful early life, being shipwrecked early in his career and later {{captured}} by the French. Nevertheless, he saw enough service {{to attract the attention of}} powerful patrons that secured his rise through the ranks. An officer of considerable ability, he won a noteworthy victory against a stronger French opponent, before embarking on a period of distinguished service off the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, working closely with the British generals fighting the Peninsular War, and markedly contributing to their success. His good service led to a prime posting in command of a squadron despatched to hunt down and neutralise the American super frigates during the War of 1812. He came close to capturing the , but lost her in circumstances that were unclear and would later return <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> <b>him.</b> The years of peace that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars saw him rewarded with a baronetcy, and his continued to serve in the navy where he was tasked with the suppression of the slave trade.
