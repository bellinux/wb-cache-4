5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.

A population's allele frequency is <b>the</b> <b>fraction</b> of the copies of one gene that share a particular form.
