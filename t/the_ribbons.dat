5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E

The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. <b>The</b> <b>ribbons</b> that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E

25|$|The {{locations}} where {{the band and}} ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement {{can result in a}} poorly fitting shoe. Optimal placement depends on the physical attributes of the foot to which it will be mated, and consequently <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> and elastic bands cannot be attached during the shoe manufacturing process. After acquiring a new pair of pointe shoes, a dancer must determine the appropriate attachment locations for <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> and elastic bands and then sew them, or arrange for them to be sewn, onto the shoes.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ribbon</b> synapse is {{a special}} type of synapse found in sensory neurons such as {{photoreceptor}} cells, retinal bipolar cells, and hair cells. Ribbon synapses contain a dense protein structure that tethers an array of vesicles perpendicular to the presynaptic membrane. In an electron micrograph it appears as a ribbon like structure perpendicular to the membrane. Unlike <b>the</b> 'traditional' synapse, <b>ribbon</b> synapses can maintain a graded release of vesicles. In other words the more depolarized a neuron the higher the rate of vesicle fusion. <b>The</b> <b>Ribbon</b> synapse active zone is separated into two regions, the archiform density and <b>the</b> <b>ribbon.</b> <b>The</b> archiform density {{is the site of}} vesicle fusion and <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> stores <b>the</b> releasable pool of vesicles. <b>The</b> <b>ribbon</b> structure is composed primarily of the protein RIBEYE, about 64-69% of <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> volume, and is tethered to the archiform density by scaffolding proteins such as Bassoon.|$|R
25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} of calcium-dependent exocytosis at retinal ribbon synapses suggests that <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> accommodates {{a reservoir of}} primed releasable vesicles. The vesicles that are in closest contact with the presynaptic plasma membrane {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> constitute <b>the</b> small, rapidly releasable pool of vesicles, whereas the remaining vesicles tethered to <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> constitute <b>the</b> large, readily (slower) releasable pool. These regularly aligned rows of synaptic vesicles tethered to either side of <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> along with <b>the</b> expression of the kinesin motor protein KIF3A at retinal ribbon synapses can move vesicles like a conveyor belt to the docking/release site at <b>the</b> <b>ribbon</b> base.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{protection}} spell is causing Regina {{to believe that}} Emma trapped her inside, and as she sees {{herself in the mirror}} Regina changes her clothes to those she used to wear as the Evil Queen. When Emma and Elsa arrive and unseal the Vault, Regina uses her pyrokinetic powers against them and they shield themselves with <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> on their wrists; <b>the</b> <b>ribbons</b> free Emma and Elsa, and Emma uses her powers to stall Regina from going after them. Regina, believing that Emma went to the Sheriff's station, shows up there, only to set up a battle between her and Mary Margaret. Regina then makes Anna and Kristoff disappear, and they end up on the beachfront. As Kristoff argues with Anna, she trips her leg on a bottle. Anna picks up the bottle and hits Kristoff on his head knocking him out, allowing the letter that was inside the bottle to fall into Anna's hands. Anna then reads the letter and she races off to the Snow Queen's lair.|$|E
