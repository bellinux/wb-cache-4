5000|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} of Synchronize It! {{is to compare}} two folders - a source folder and a <b>target</b> <b>folder.</b> You can choose whether subfolders should be included (allowing exclusion of specific subfolders), whether only matching folders should be compared and you can apply file filters. Various actions and comparison modes are available (see below). Custom sessions can be saved and organized into projects.|$|E
5000|$|It recursively synchronizes {{a source}} folder to a <b>target</b> <b>folder.</b> For that, {{it uses a}} very simple {{algorithm}} of comparing file's [...] "last change date" [...] attribute, between source and target folders, when the attribute is different between source and target, the engine replaces the target file with a fresh copy from the source and updates its [...] "last changed date" [...] attribute to exactly that of the source file.|$|E

5|$|On July 7, 1941, Hansell went to London, England, as {{a special}} {{observer}} attached to the military attaché, where he was privy to {{the inner workings of}} RAF intelligence and their <b>target</b> <b>folders</b> on the German industrial infrastructure. In his memoir, Hansell stated that in the exchange of information, the AAF received nearly a ton of material, shipped back to the United States in a bomber.|$|R
50|$|Sidney Cotton’s work {{found only}} grudging {{approval}} with the Royal Air Force, but eventually {{his work was}} incorporated into No. 1 Photographic Development Unit (PDU) at RAF Heston and then RAF Benson, a unit from which most later British air reconnaissance developed. (It soon was renamed 1 PRU, R for reconnaissance.) Key to the RAF’s intellectual ascendancy in reconnaissance was {{the establishment of the}} Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) at RAF Medmenham. Priority tasks of this unit were to prepare <b>target</b> <b>folders</b> and to chart Axis air defenses. In short order, it began {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} bombing. See Photo interpretation.|$|R
50|$|While the SAC U-2s flew high-altitude {{reconnaissance}} missions, {{the staff}} of the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, was made aware of the potential need for low-level flights over Cuba. Mission planners at Shaw began planning such flights and preparing <b>target</b> <b>folders.</b> On 21 October, HQ Tactical Air Command ordered the 363d to deploy to MacDill AFB, Florida. The wing began immediately to move RF-101 Voodoo and RB-66 Destroyer aircraft, personnel, and photographic equipment to Florida. By the next morning, the aircraft were at MacDill, cameras cocked, ready to carry out any reconnaissance missions.|$|R
50|$|The package feature {{can be used}} to {{synchronize}} distant, non-connected PCs. A list of {{the files}} contained in the source folder is stored in a small package file, that can be kept on a USB stick. The package is then synchronized with the <b>target</b> <b>folder</b> on another computer. Files only present or modified on the target computer will be packed into the package. A package hence contains only the files that are different and not the entire folder, which makes it a tool to keep non-connected computers synchronized (e.g. a PC at work and a PC at home).|$|E
5000|$|Although Windows {{does not}} provide {{convenient}} tools to create it, Explorer supports a [...] "folder link" [...] or [...] "shell link folder": a folder with the system attribute set, containing a hidden [...] "desktop.ini" [...] (folder customization) file which tells Explorer to look in that same folder for a [...] "target.lnk" [...] shortcut file pointing to another folder. When viewed in Explorer, the shell link folder then appears to have {{the contents of the}} <b>target</b> <b>folder</b> in it—that is, the customized folder becomes the effective shortcut. This technique is used by Microsoft Windows for items like WebDAV folders. The advent of file system links in Windows Vista and up has made shell link folders less useful.|$|E
50|$|Winzip 15.5 (April 2011): New {{compression}} algorithms {{designed for}} multi-processor systems that zip files up to twice as fast, new WinZip Desktop Gadget option called 'Folder I Choose' {{that allows you}} to create or select a <b>target</b> <b>folder</b> for zipping/unzipping files on a case-by-case basis, dynamic, context-sensitive icons that automatically change to reflect the WinZip tasks available to your specific situation, streamlined processes that remove unnecessary dialogs and cut down on extra steps, the ability to show/hide the Address bar, the ability to instantly jump between any instances of WinZip that you currently have open, the ability to customize {{the look and feel of}} your WinZip interface with interchangeable themes, improved destination folder management, so when you open/alter a zipped file's contents directly from an email attachment, WinZip will prompt you to save your work to a new location on your computer (rather than the email temp folder), streamlined 'Unzip and Try' processes that remove extra steps, making temporary viewing even quicker and easier, extended enterprise support that provides IT control over the addition/alteration of e-mail services.|$|E
40|$|People are storing an {{increasing}} amount of their data digitally {{in the form}} of files. However, many of the current navigation based interfaces are unable to support efficient retrieval of this information. We develop a file system crawler, and use this to conduct a user study to characterise the structural features and temporal usage patterns of file systems. Based on these findings and the extensive prior literature, we develop a spatially consistent representation of entire file systems which is augmented with colour-coded tags allowing efficient access to temporally relevant <b>target</b> <b>folders</b> within the file system (SCOFT). We conduct a user study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this technique and the supporting techniques developed. Our findings show that SCOFT allows users to revisit files 3 times faster than when using a standard file browser...|$|R
40|$|One area of {{particular}} concern for computer forensics examiners involves situations in which someone utilized software applications to destroy evidence. There are products available in the marketplace that are relatively inexpensive and advertised as being able to destroy targeted portions of data stored within a computer system. This study was undertaken to identify these tools and analyze them {{to determine the extent}} to which each of the evaluated data wiping applications perform their tasks and to identify trace evidence, if any, left behind on disk media after executing these applications. We evaluated five Windows 7 compatible software products whose advertised features include the ability for users to wipe <b>targeted</b> files, <b>folders,</b> or evidence of selected activities. We conducted a series of experiments that involved executing each application on systems with identical data, and we then analyzed the results and compared the before and after images for each application. We identified information for each application that is beneficial to forensics examiners when faced with similar situations. This paper describes our application selection process, our application evaluation methodology, and our findings. Following this, we describe limitations of this study and suggest areas of additional research that will benefit the study of digital forensics...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1. A user {{points in}} mid-air to a <b>target</b> <b>folder</b> on a wall-sized display (left); Stoppers provide visual {{feedback}} as the user’s gesture {{goes out of}} the display range (center) and guide her back (right). To interact with wall-sized displays (WSD) from a five-to-ten feet distance, users can leverage touchless gestures tracked by depth sensors such as Microsoft’s Kinect®. Yet when user’s gestures inadvertently land outside the WSD range, no visual feedback appears on the screen. This leaves users to wonder what happened, and slows down their actions. To combat this problem, we introduce Stoppers, a subtle visual cue that appears at the gesture’s last exit position informing the users that their gestures are off the WSD range, but being still tracked by sensors. In an 18 -participant study investigating touchless selection tasks on an ultra-large 15. 3 M pixel WSD, introducing Stoppers made users twice as fast in getting their gesture back within the display range. Users reported Stoppers as intuitive, non-distracting and an easy-to-use visual guide. By providing persistent visual feedback, Stoppers show promise as a key ingredient to enhance fundamental mechanisms of user interaction in {{a broad range of}} touchless environments...|$|E
