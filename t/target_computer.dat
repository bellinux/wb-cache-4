25|$|New {{versions}} of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers {{as they come}} to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the <b>target</b> <b>computer</b> to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.|$|E
25|$|Keystroke logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the <b>target</b> <b>computer</b> to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E
2500|$|Tor {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against end-to-end timing attacks: if an attacker can watch the traffic {{coming out of the}} <b>target</b> <b>computer,</b> and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a [...]onion site), he can use statistical analysis to discover that {{they are part of the}} same circuit.|$|E
50|$|According to an NSA {{document}} {{leaked to}} Der Spiegel, the NSA sometimes swaps the monitor cables on <b>targeted</b> <b>computers</b> with a bugged monitor cable {{in order to}} allow the NSA to remotely see what's displayed on the <b>targeted</b> <b>computer</b> monitor.|$|R

2500|$|In German-speaking countries, spyware used or {{made by the}} {{government}} is called govware by computer experts (in common parlance: Regierungstrojaner, literally [...] "Government Trojan"). [...] Govware is typically a trojan horse software used to intercept communications from the <b>target</b> <b>computer.</b> [...] Some countries, like Switzerland and Germany, have a legal framework governing {{the use of such}} software. In the US, the term [...] "policeware" [...] has been used for similar purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Variants A, B, C and E exploit a {{vulnerability}} in the Server Service on Windows computers, {{in which}} an already-infected source computer uses a specially-crafted RPC request to force a buffer overflow and execute shellcode on the <b>target</b> <b>computer.</b> [...] On the source computer, the virus runs an HTTP server on a port between 1024 and 10000; the target shellcode connects back to this HTTP server to download {{a copy of the}} virus in DLL form, which it then attaches to svchost.exe. [...] Variants B and later may attach instead to a running services.exe or Windows Explorer process.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 December 2014, an exploit {{was found}} {{affecting}} the Windows and Mac {{versions of the}} Git client. An attacker could perform arbitrary code execution on a <b>target</b> <b>computer</b> with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named [...]git (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as [...]GIT or [...]Git, needed because Git doesn't allow the all-lowercase version of [...]git to be created manually) with malicious files in the [...]git/hooks subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user pulls (downloads) {{a version of the}} repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the [...]git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in [...]git/hooks may be run, which results in the attacker's commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the [...]git/config configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.|$|E

50|$|By itself, small packets {{will not}} evade any IDS that reassembles packet streams. However, small packets {{can be further}} {{modified}} in order to complicate reassembly and detection. One evasion technique is to pause between sending parts of the attack, hoping that the IDS will time out before the <b>target</b> <b>computer</b> does. A second evasion technique is to send the packets out of order, confusing simple packet re-assemblers but not the <b>target</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E

50|$|Files {{needed by}} a service are {{automatically}} {{transferred to the}} computer executing that service so that the user is freed from having to manage file transfers. A file transfer mechanism is used allowing files to be transferred directly from the source to the <b>target</b> <b>computer</b> system, going through any number of firewalls between source and target, without being stored {{on any of the}} intermediary systems. This mechanism uses the shortest path for transferring files to a <b>target</b> <b>computer</b> from the source.|$|E
