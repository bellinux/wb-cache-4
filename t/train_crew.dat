5|$|In May 2016, the RAIB {{published}} {{a report on}} the incident, which largely blamed the incident on the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> tampering with a safety system that would otherwise have safely brought the train to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-seven {{officers}} and crew of the two ships were at their stations, and various support personnel were present such as the three-man civilian <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> and a Marine sentry. Nine Navy {{officers and}} 29 armed guards watched over the procedure. A Coast Guard fire barge with a crew of five was docked at the pier. An officer who left the docks shortly after 10p.m. noticed that the Quinault′s propeller was slowly turning over and that the men of Division Three were having trouble pulling munitions from the rail cars {{because they had been}} packed so tightly.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, the 15th Wing {{provided}} {{logistical support}} and <b>trained</b> <b>crews</b> for both wings. However, it reorganized as a mission capable tactical fighter wing for the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. [...] Once the wings began to equip with the Phantom, the 15th Wing resumed {{the role of}} <b>training</b> <b>crews</b> on the new fighter.|$|R
5|$|The player begins {{inside a}} space station called Starport {{orbiting}} the planet Arth. Here they buy and sell minerals, Endurium (fuel), and artifacts, recruit and <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> members, and upgrade parts of the ship. The player hires a crew from five species to man the ship's six posts: navigator, science officer, engineer, communications officer, doctor, and captain. A crewman's proficiency {{is determined by the}} relevant skill: a science officer with a high science skill can determine more of a planet's properties and detect aliens at a greater range, for example. Skills are increased through training, which must be purchased. One crewman can man multiple posts, but different species have different maximum skill levels. The ship is initially equipped only with engines and a limited supply of Endurium, a type of crystal used as fuel. The ship can be modified and upgraded through the purchase of weapons, armor, and shields.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E
5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
50|$|Instead of <b>training</b> B-17 <b>crews,</b> Mountain Home airmen began <b>training</b> <b>crews</b> for the B-24 Liberator. The {{first group}} {{to do so}} was the 470th Bombardment Group (Heavy), which trained at Mountain Home from May 1943 until January 1944, when the unit moved to Tonopah AAF Nevada. The 490th Bombardment Group (Heavy) {{replaced}} the 470th and <b>trained</b> B-24 <b>crews</b> until it deployed to RAF Eye England in April 1944. The 494th Bombardment Group then replaced the 490th, once more <b>training</b> Liberator <b>crews.</b>|$|R

A 2 <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> office is on the Track 3 side, and a 5 <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> office is on the Track 2 side. There are public restrooms along Track 3 just within the station's main entrance. The columns separating the two tracks are painted light-blue.|$|E

25|$|The <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> reacted {{quickly to}} the incident. The four coaches behind the two ablaze were {{uncoupled}} and pushed back, leaving them isolated up the line. Having drawn forward and uncoupled the two burning vehicles, the driver proceeded with the front eight coaches to Grantshouse station.|$|E
25|$|The bar-lounge cars next to {{the diner}} always {{included}} dormitory space for the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> (a staff of 3–4 cooks and 6–7 stewards) required for the two-night-and-one-day trip.

25|$|In {{order to}} enter any section of line, the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> must obtain {{permission}} from Control and the relevant token. Each section of {{line is a}} token block section. The WHR uses the traditional Staff and Ticket system in which trains can either be issued with the section token staff or a numbered ticket. Tickets allow multiple trains to pass one-at-a-time through a section in one direction. The Controller advises the <b>train</b> <b>crew</b> which method they will be using. Tickets are kept in a locked box opened by a key on the token staff. This means the last train must use the token staff {{to pass through the}} section, so it can be used for trains to travel in the opposite direction. For additional protection, both the footplate crew and the guard must see the token or ticket before the train can depart.|$|E
25|$|Table A of the Network Rail Sectional Appendix {{provides}} {{a list of}} these.
