5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, there was {{increasing}} {{rebellion against the}} rule of Somali President Siad Barre, a military dictator who maintained <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> of power and had a record of human rights abuses. By 1990, what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war, with several militias organized to overthrow the central government.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to the crisis and lack of transparency in the response brought attention {{to the state of}} media in Malaysia. After decades of having <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> of media, during which government officials were accustomed to passing over issues without scrutiny or accountability, Malaysia was suddenly thrust to the forefront of global media and unable to adjust to demands for transparency.|$|E
50|$|In hindsight, this {{conclusion}} now seems obvious. Non-diabetics have much <b>tighter</b> <b>control</b> of their {{blood sugar levels}} than diabetics, as the normal pancreas can react to blood sugar {{in a way that}} twice-daily injections cannot. However, to the diabetic adult patient who resists the additional burden and/or expense of <b>tighter</b> <b>control,</b> the DCCT provides medical evidence that <b>tighter</b> <b>control</b> is measurably favorable to the patient.|$|R

5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> over media access, {{not only to the}} convention grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with unauthorized members of the media.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} by nightfall, when John the Armenian with his {{men and the}} 600 Huns rejoined his army, that Belisarius {{realized}} {{the extent of his}} victory. The cavalry spent the night at the battlefield. In the next morning, as the infantry (and Antonina) caught up, the whole army made for Carthage, where it arrived as night was falling. The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under <b>tight</b> <b>control,</b> refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{half the}} world's known {{reserves}} {{are located in}} Bolivia, {{and according to the}} US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium. Other important reserves are located in Chile, China, and Brazil. Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking {{to gain access to the}} lithium resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E

5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> over the town, and it grew {{little in the}} early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's common land and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded the first steps towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability of affordable housing combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates made it an attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Burnet {{scaled back}} his {{laboratory}} work, taking one day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Diệm regime {{began to}} lose its <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> over the country as civil unrest spread {{as a result of}} the Buddhist crisis. Large scale demonstrations by the Buddhist {{majority}} erupted in response to the government shootings of nine Buddhists in Huế who were protesting against a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag during Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. Thảo was part of the many plots that engulfed Saigon, destabilising the regime. Aiming for a 15 July coup, Tuyến consulted with Thảo regarding his plans, but Tuyến was too closely associated with Nhu to recruit the necessary military aid and he was subsequently exiled by Nhu.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 November, along with the 20th Battalion, it was tasked with the capture of Belhamed, a hill {{adjacent}} to Sidi Rezegh. With two companies leading the battalion's portion of the advance, the objective was captured with a bayonet charge. Peart was wounded during the attack but remained in command. The battalion held the hill {{for three days and}} then swapped its positions with the 20th Battalion before, on 30 November, the 15th Panzer Division surrounded and attacked Belhamed. While the 20th Battalion was effectively destroyed, the 18th Battalion, with Peart maintaining <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> of some personnel who were close to panicking, managed to evacuate in time and reached the British 70th Division in Tobruk. Here it manned the lines, with Gray back in command, fending off German attacks, until 11 December when it was withdrawn to Baggush. Meeting up {{with the rest of the}} division, it was brought back up to strength and manned defences to protect the lines of communication to the front.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} {{the power of}} the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (十三衙門), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under <b>tight</b> <b>control</b> during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.|$|E

50|$|The Precision Dribbling feature allows {{players to}} dribble whilst shielding, {{meaning that the}} player can still move around the pitch whilst holding players off, rather than being rooted to the spot. Close control has been added below jogging {{as a way of}} {{allowing}} players to take smaller, more frequent touches, keeping the ball closer and keeping <b>tighter</b> <b>control.</b> Players will now be much more aware of their surroundings. As an example, players in possession near the touchline will understand their position, and keep <b>tighter</b> <b>control</b> of the ball to stop it running out of play.|$|R

5000|$|Brad Adams the Asia {{director}} at the U.S. based NGO Human Rights Watch has said in 2006; [...] "Although 'azad' means 'free,' the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but, the Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir government with <b>tight</b> <b>controls</b> on basic freedoms." [...] Scholar Christopher Snedden has observed that despite <b>tight</b> <b>controls</b> the people of Azad Kashmir have generally accepted whatever Pakistan has done to them, which in any case has varied little from how most Pakistanis have been treated (by Pakistan). According to Christopher Snedden {{one of the reasons}} for this was that the people of Azad Kashmir had always wanted to be a part of Pakistan.|$|R
