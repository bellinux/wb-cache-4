A questionnaire to dog owners and a blood sample of 181 dogs from four breeds, miniature and standard bull terriers, German shepherds, and Staffordshire bull terriers showed these to be more susceptible to compulsive and repetitive behaviors. It is suggested that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> learn through studying OCD in dogs, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> can to understand human biology and the genetics involved in the heredity of susceptibility to disorders such as OCD.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} science that regards natural cognition as a biological function. It {{is based on}} the theoretical assumption that every organism—whether a single cell or multicellular—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling. That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives {{from one generation to the}} next. And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems, and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> understand the nature of cognition.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally intended}} to port existing Halo 3 assets to Reach and update them. For Halo 3, Bungie {{had been forced to}} shrink parts of the game to fit the game engine's constraints, but wanted to make Reach look better than its predecessors. [...] "The more we started looking into this, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> found that realistically we could rebuild each asset from scratch with a huge increase in quality without significantly investing more time," [...] said Bungie 3D artist Scott Shepherd. [...] Texture resolution and polygon counts for models increased; the Reach assault rifle is constructed of more polygons than an entire Marine character from Halo 3. The prequel concept also gave the art team an opportunity to redesign key enemies, weapons, and elements of the series. Artists found inspiration in the original concept art for Halo: Combat Evolved; the shape for the redesigned Covenant Grunts came from a sketch that concept artist Shi Kai Wang created ten years earlier.|$|E

That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E

He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E

Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people.

Nas' rapping {{is characterized by}} internal rhymes, a relaxed, plainspoken flow, and transparent lyrics addressing moments in his life, including his youth and the personal {{events leading up to}} the album. Erika Ramirez of Billboard observes [...] "stories of internal and external battles, some of which he won and some he lost." [...] David Dennis of The Village Voice writes that his lyrics address hip hop's [...] "golden era" [...] and [...] "the trials and tribulations of adult relationships". Brandon Soderberg from Spin asserts that his lyrics [...] "constantly remind nostalgics that the good ol' days were often chaotic and desperate". Slant Magazines Manan Desai finds Nas' comparison of his album to Gaye's Here, My Dear apropos. [...] "Like Nas, Gaye was pushing 40 when he recorded his album", Desai wrote. [...] "He'd cemented his position as one of R's greatest, and yet, he never sounded more anguished about where all that fame was leading him. There's something similar going on throughout Life Is Good; <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> hear Nas repeat that titular refrain, the less convincing he sounds." [...] AllMusic's David Jeffries said the lyrics about his divorce were [...] "unfiltered carpet bombing of love and marriage"; both Jeffries and Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic characterize the content as [...] "venomous".

500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E
