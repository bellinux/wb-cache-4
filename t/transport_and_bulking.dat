40|$|Organic small {{molecule}} (SM) acceptors {{containing a}} perylene diimide (PDI) moiety, F 2 B-T 2 PDI and T 2 PDI are synthesized, {{and the effects}} of their molecular geometry on the performance of fullerene-free organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are investigated. The SM acceptors possess a PDI-core-PDI structure in which the PDI wing is connected to conjugated core units. By incorporation of a 2, 5 -difluorobenzene (F 2 B) moiety within the core unit, the planarity of the conjugated core is enhanced and the energy levels of the SM acceptor are down-shifted. In terms of molecular geometry, the F 2 B-containing SM acceptor, F 2 B-T 2 PDI, has a rigid core, which can symmetrically align the two PDI wings and enhance molecular packing. As a result, improved electron <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulk</b> heterojunction morphology of the active layers are achieved. Furthermore, the incorporation of the F 2 B moiety effectively down-shifts the HOMO energy level, preventing back-transfer of holes from the acceptor to the cathode and enhancing the absorption of complementary wavelengths of the donor polymer, PTB 7 -Th. Leveraged by the beneficial geometric and energetic effects from the incorporation of F 2 B units, the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-free OPV devices using F 2 B-T 2 PDI reached 5 %, whereas that using T 2 PDI was 3. 63 %. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistryclos...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel kinetic {{multi-layer}} model that explicitly resolves mass <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> chemical reaction {{at the surface}} <b>and</b> in the <b>bulk</b> of aerosol particles (KM-SUB). The model {{is based on the}} PRA framework of gas–particle interactions (P¨oschl et al., 5 2007), and it includes reversible adsorption, surface reactions and surface-bulk exchange as well as <b>bulk</b> diffusion <b>and</b> reaction. Unlike earlier models, KM-SUB does not require simplifying assumptions about steady-state conditions and radial mixing. The temporal evolution and concentration profiles of volatile and non-volatile species at the gas-particle interface and in the particle bulk can be modeled along with surface 10 concentrations and gas uptake coefficients. In this study we explore and exemplify the effects of bulk diffusion on the rate of reactive gas uptake for a simple reference system, the ozonolysis of oleic acid particles, in comparison to experimental data and earlier model studies. We demonstrate how KM-SUB can be used to interpret and analyze experimental data from laboratory stud 15 ies, and how the results can be extrapolated to atmospheric conditions. In particular, we show how interfacial <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>transport,</b> i. e., surface accommodation, <b>bulk</b> accommodation <b>and</b> <b>bulk</b> diffusion, influence the kinetics of the chemical reaction. Sensitivity studies suggest that in fine air particulate matter oleic acid and compounds with similar reactivity against ozone (C=C double bonds) can reach chemical lifetimes of 20 multiple hours only if they are embedded in a (semi-) solid matrix with very low diffusion coefficients (10 − 10 cm 2 s− 1). Depending on the complexity of the investigated system, unlimited numbers of volatile and non-volatile species and chemical reactions can be flexibly added and treated with KM-SUB. We propose and intend to pursue the application of KM-SUB 25 as a basis {{for the development of a}} detailed master mechanism of aerosol chemistry as well as for the derivation of simplified but realistic parameterizations for large-scale atmospheric and climate models. ...|$|R

This forced these governments to subsidize the ports, put up with slow and expensive port operations, reject labor-saving innovations, allow the unions to monopolize cargo handling and stowage and negotiate collective agreements that institutionalized inefficient practices. 2 The monopolistic control of the port activities {{on the part of}} the port administration, customs, labor unions <b>and</b> firms <b>transporting</b> freight to the country interior, made competition to vanish. 3 In addition, the lack of appropriate investments in infrastructure and technology, especially in the 80 s, resulted in inefficient an obsolete ports across the region.

Surface <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> behavior in rare-earth (samaria) doped and undoped ceria were investigated, with particular emphasis on applications in electrochemical and thermochemical energy conversion processes such as fuel cells and solar fuel production. The electrochemical responses of bulk- processed ceria with porous Pt and Au electrodes were analyzed using 1 -D <b>and</b> 2 -D <b>transport</b> models to decouple surface reactions, near-surface <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>transport.</b> Combined experimental <b>and</b> numerical results indicate that hydrogen electro-oxidation and hydrolysis near open-circuit conditions occur preferentially over the ceria | gas interface rather than over the ceria | gas | metal interface, with the rate-limiting step likely to be either surface reaction or transport through the surface oxygen vacancy depletion layer. In addition, epitaxial thin films of ceria were grown on zirconia substrates using pulsed-laser deposition to examine electrocatalysis over well-defined microstructures. Physical models were derived to analyze the electrochemical impedance response. By varying the film thickness, interfacial and chemical capacitance were decoupled, with the latter shown to be proportional to the small polaron densities. The geometry of microfabricated metal current collectors (metal = Pt, Ni) was also systematically varied to investigate the relative activity of the ceria | gas and the ceria | metal | gas interfaces. The data suggests that the electrochemical activity of the metal-ceria composite is only weakly dependent on the metal due to the relatively high activity of the ceria | gas interface. In addition to electrochemical experiments, thermochemical reduction-oxidation studies were performed on ceria. It was shown that thermally-reduced ceria, upon exposure to H 2 O and/or CO 2, can be reoxidized to form H 2, CO, and/or CH 4. Analysis of gas evolution rates confirms that the kinetics of ceria oxidation by H 2 O and CO 2 are dominated by surface reactions, rather than by ambipolar oxygen diffusion. Temperature-programmed oxidation experiments revealed that, even under thermodynamically favored conditions, carbonaceous species do not form on the surface of neat ceria, thereby giving a high CO selectivity when dissociating CO 2.
