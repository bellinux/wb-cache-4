25|$|On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua {{was about}} 27 {{miles south of}} Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire {{broke out in the}} gas <b>turbine</b> <b>house.</b> It was {{established}} that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the gas turbine generator to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|E

In this paper neutron diffraction techniques have been used to measure surface and internal strains in the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> prior to operation (residual strains) in an area prone to fatigue crack initiation, while high temperature strain gauges have been used to measure surface induced strains due to thermal cycling on gas stand test. Service strain measurements have been compared with simulation results. The direction and magnitude of the measured residual strain is explored in relation to the effect on fatigue crack initiation/ propagation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> of a {{turbocharger}} {{is exposed}} to extensive cyclic thermo-mechanical loading. This leads to multi-axial stress states with local plastifications, so that {{the design of the}} <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> becomes a major challenge in ensuring the guaranteed lifetime in relation to the high-temperature behavior of the materials. The first step was to develop and validate a phenomenological lifetime estimation approach, in conjunction with a constitutive material model applied in a preceding Finite-Element analysis, for application on the casting materials Ni-resist D 5 S and GJV. A satisfactory estimation of the number of cycles until crack initiation, by considering creep fatigue interaction, was demonstrated on specimens subject to characteristic load conditions derived by a critical plane approach. In the second step, the adaption for <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> design is investigated...|$|R

40|$|An improved, lightweight, <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> {{unit for}} an {{intermittent}} combustion reciprocating {{internal combustion engine}} turbocharger is prepared from a lay-up or molding of carbon-carbon composite materials in a single-piece or two-piece process.

50|$|It {{was planned}} to have two cooling towers per reactor, as was typical with such Soviet designs.

5000|$|It {{utilizes}} {{a single}} turbocharger with a <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> size of 1.15 A/R. In 1999, an air-to-air intercooler {{was added to}} cool the charged air from the turbo for increased air density. With the new cooler, denser air would increase the horsepower potential of the engine, while also reducing exhaust gas temperatures (EGT). Eventually, the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> was changed to a [...]84 A/R and a wastegate was added.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The Garrett GT 42 <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> is a {{spheroidal}} ductile {{cast iron}} casting, which according to the ASME B 31. 3 (1996) Code for Pressure Piping, does not satisfy the Pebble Bed Micro Model (PBMM) design requirements. By using Geometrical Reverse Engineering (GRE) methods, a 3 -D virtual model, and if required, a mould of the existing design can be created to recast a <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> in a suitable material. The aim {{of this research was}} to study, evaluate, identify and implement the most promising method(s) to reverse engineer the Garrett GT 42 <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> without destroying it in the process. GRE advantages and limitations influenced by practical contact (tactile) and non-contact data acquisition problem areas provided evaluation guidelines that assisted in the allocation of Computed Tomography (CT) as the most promising method to reverse engineer the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing.</b> X-ray and neutron CT were implemented. Neutron Computed Tomography (NCT) using CADKEY® V 21 CAD modelling software at the SAFARI- 1 nuclear reactor, NECSA, produced the most favourable 3 -D NURBs model, which had a geometrical external accuracy of 95 % and a volumetric internal accuracy of 94 %. It was verified by comparing the results with an 87 % geometrical external- and 85 % volumetric internal accurate 3 -D NURBs model created by the implementation of an alternative contact GRE method, i. e. geometrical inspection and measurements.

50|$|In 2009 a {{hydroelectric}} power station was completed just upriver from Mahon Bridge. The station is privately owned and is fed from two weirs, one on the Mahon {{and the other on}} the Mahon Og, about 2 km upstream of the village. The scheme generates a maximum of 850 kW of electricity to add to the national grid. The <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> is of a very inconspicuous and low profile design being mostly located below ground level and not visible from the nearby road. This was necessary due to the region possessing outstanding scenery. It was originally conceived and run by Sean Murphy, a local historian and actor who features in the locally produced comedy series, Bachelors in Trouble.The <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> is located very close to a large ruined mill which was built in the famine years 1845-1848 but which saw little use as a corn mill before being sold. At some stage in the mid 20th century part of it was demolished by Waterford Co. Council and the stone used for road building, a fact which is now greatly resented by residents of the area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Newly {{developed}} turbocharger Swing {{valve assembly}} (arm and bush) {{has to be}} tested to study the product life cycle and to know the satisfactory working throughout entire duty cycle. The <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> consists of swing valve assembly used to bypass the exhaust gas directly to atmosphere whenever not required. This assembly consists of two types of fits. Interference fit between <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> and bush and clearance fit between bush and arm. But, it is expensive and requires more time to carry out experimental study and measurements can be made only at {{the limited number of}} time stations. So, Finite element method is considered as a standard approach which is economical avoiding frequent experimental studies to find the performance of turbochargers. This paper deals with structural analysis of turbocharger’s swing valve assembly where von misses stress distributions are plotted for both minimum and maximum interference cases due to thermal loads acting b/w bush and <b>turbine</b> <b>housing.</b> Meshed turbocharger and swing valve assembly model is imported to ANSYS for solving and preprocessing and given run for structural analysis.
