6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>Larry's</b> first voyage in the {{merchant}} service, {{and that was}} the reason why, hitherto, he had been so reserved; since he well knew that merchant seamen generally affect a certain superiority to [...] "blubber- boilers," [...] as they contemptuously style those who hunt the leviathan. But Larry turned out to be such an inoffensive fellow, and so well understood his business aboard ship, and was so ready to jump to an order, that he was exempted from the taunts which he might otherwise have encountered.|$|R

Wailing away one minute - folk mood, jazz lightness the next. Seems impossible on paper, but with ASFB it works. Showing maturity in sound and lyric, all tracks are standouts. All their albums are treasures with layers of interest both musically and lyrically." ...|$|R

50|$|The website also recognizes, with Honorable Mentions, {{individuals}} who survive their misadventures with their reproductive capacity intact. One example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Lawnchair <b>Larry,</b> who attached helium-filled weather balloons to {{a lawn chair}} and floated far above Long Beach, California, in July 1982. He reached an altitude of 16000 ft but survived, to be later fined for crossing controlled airspace. Another notable honorable mention {{was given to the}} two men who attempted to burgle the home of footballer Duncan Ferguson (who had four convictions for assault and had served six months in Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison) in 2001, with one burglar requiring three days' hospitalization after being confronted by the player.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a slight}} laugh at <b>this,</b> and <b>Larry</b> <b>was</b> graciously cast loose, and {{permitted}} to remain.

6000|$|... "Humph," [...] ejaculated {{the mate}} contemptuously, for Cupples, {{although}} a kind-hearted man, was somewhat cynical {{and had not}} a particle of sentiment in his soul.

Said to be his best." ...|$|R
60|$|Imagine, on Mr. Pike's part, that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> one for <b>Larry</b> and {{at least}} ten for Kid Twist, Nosey Murphy, and Bert Rhine. I'll not be so absurd {{as to say that}} the mate is afraid of those gangsters. I doubt if he has ever {{experienced}} fear. It is not in him. On the other hand, I am confident that he apprehends trouble from these men, and that it was for their benefit he made this example of Larry.|$|R
5000|$|During the January 1977 North American Team Trials, an {{allegation}} of improper communication between partners Richard H. Katz and Larry T.

5000|$|... 1978 was {{a terrible}} season for the Red Wings, as the club had three managers, Ken Boyer, Al Widmar, and Frank Robinson. The team {{finished}} 68-72. Robinson was replaced by Doc Edwards, who {{managed to get the}} team to the playoffs in 1980, but could not manage a league title. Edwards was soon gone, replaced by Lance Nicholls, who in turn, was replaced by former Tidewater Tides manager Frank Verdi. The team did horribly under Verdi, and was mainly stocked with cast off former major leaguers, career minor league players, and very few prospects. The only bona fide major league prospect on the team during <b>this</b> lean period <b>was</b> <b>Larry</b> Sheets, who <b>was</b> mainly a journeyman hitter during his career.|$|R
5000|$|While {{representing}} Caesars Palace in Las Vegas , Solters {{first met}} Frank Sinatra. Solters followed Sinatra on his tour {{to ensure that}} Sinatra would be connected with the hotel. Solters told Sinatra that he wasn't impressed with his existing publicist and suggested that Solters would invite columnists in each city where he performed to meet the star five minutes before he went on stage to give the reporters a rarely obtained chance to speak directly with Sinatra. The New Yorker recounted that [...] "The first columnist they tried <b>this</b> on <b>was</b> <b>Larry</b> Fields of the Philadelphia Daily News, whose wife fainted when Sinatra kissed her cheek. 'Take care of it, Lee,' Sinatra said, and he was off." [...] After the concert, Fields wrote a glowing review. Solters used the same technique in succeeding cities and built much positive press for the singer. When he returned to Las Vegas, Sinatra's attorney Mickey Rudin informed Solters that [...] "You're taking over" [...] Sinatra's publicity. The professional relationship with Sinatra lasted for 26 years.|$|R

Larry! The Cheese!". The only cure is for someone to feed him cheese, leading to Curly's manic catchphrase upon sighting a mouse in the film short. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> explained by <b>Larry,</b> stating that Curly's father was a rat.|$|R
500|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{featured}} four {{characters that}} {{were intended to}} be series regulars if the show was to be picked-up for a first season: Jerry, George, Kramer and Claire the waitress. Though it was already settled that Seinfeld would play a fictionalized version of himself, auditions were held for the other three characters. Though George <b>was</b> based on <b>Larry</b> David, David <b>was</b> keen on writing, {{and did not have}} the desire to portray the character himself. Prior to the casting progress, Seinfeld pleaded with his friend Jake Johannsen to play the part, but he rejected it. When the casting process started, as casting director Marc Hirschfeld stated, the casting crew [...] "saw every actor [...] could possibly see in Los Angeles". Among these actors <b>were</b> <b>Larry</b> Miller, Brad Hall, David Alan Grier, and Nathan Lane yet none of them seemed fit for the part. Jason Alexander auditioned for the part via a video tape, though he had very little hope for being cast, as he felt he was doing a Woody Allen impression. However, upon watching the tape, David and Seinfeld were immediately convinced Alexander would be the right actor to cast. However, traditionally casting sessions work with rounds, so Alexander and a few other actors considered for the role were flown to Los Angeles for a second audition. One of the other actors who made it to <b>this</b> round <b>was</b> <b>Larry</b> Miller. As Alexander knew Miller was a close friend of Seinfeld, he was convinced he would not get the part, but eventually did.|$|R
