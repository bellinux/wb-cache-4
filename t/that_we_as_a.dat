500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said [...] "show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." [...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them." ...|$|E

Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed {{his interest in the}} role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E

60|$|There {{is a third}} {{question}} which I have asked myself, and to which I have undertaken to give some answer. When this war be over between the Northern and Southern States, will there come upon us a necessity of fighting with the Americans? If there do come such necessity, arising out of our conduct to the States {{during the period of}} their civil war, it will indeed be hard upon us, as a nation, seeing the struggle <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation have made to be just in our dealings toward the States generally, whether they be North or South. To be just in such a period, and under such circumstances, is very difficult. In that contest between Sardinia and Austria it was all but impossible to be just to the Italians without being unjust to the Emperor of Austria. To have been strictly just at the moment one should have begun by confessing the injustice of so much that had gone before! But in this American contest such justice, though difficult, was easier. Affairs of trade rather than of treaties chiefly interfered; and these affairs, by a total disregard of our own pecuniary interests, could be so managed that justice might be done. This I think was effected. It may be, of course, that I am prejudiced on the side of my own nation; but striving to judge of the matter as best I may without prejudice, I cannot see <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation, have in aught offended against the strictest justice in our dealings with America during this contest. But justice has not sufficed. I do not know that our bitterest foes in the Northern States have accused us of acting unjustly. It is not justice which they have looked for at our hands, and looked for in vain--not justice, but generosity! We have not, as they say, sympathized with them in their trouble. It seems to me that such a complaint is unworthy of them as a nation, as a people, or as individuals. In such a matter generosity is another name for injustice, as it too often is in all matters. A generous sympathy with the North would have been an ostensible and crushing enmity to the South. We could not have sympathized with the North without condemning the South, and telling to the world that the South were our enemies. In ordering his own household a man should not want generosity or sympathy from the outside; and if not a man, then certainly not a nation. Generosity between nations must in its very nature be wrong. One nation may be just to another, courteous to another, even considerate to another with propriety. But no nation can be generous to another without injustice either to some third nation or to itself.|$|E
