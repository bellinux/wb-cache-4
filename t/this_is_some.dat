25|$|The grave to {{the east}} of Turkman Gate is not the {{mausoleum}} of the 13th century Sufi Shams-ul-Arifeen Shah Turkman Byabani. The Shrine of the Sufi is deep inside Mohalla Qabristan and can be approached either through Mohammad Deen Ilaichi Marg or through the road leading to Chitli Qabar from Turkman Gate. The grave {{to the east}} of Turkman Gate {{has nothing to do with}} the Sufi and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> imposter who is using lak of information on the Sufi Sanit to make some quick buck.|$|E
25|$|The global {{financial}} crisis affected the FTF, which is required maintained its value {{in real terms}} before a distribution can be made. At 30 September 2010, the maintained value was $27.3 million; the result of capital growth and contributions from development partners. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> $3.5 million higher than {{the market value of}} $23.8 million. The gap of 15% between the market value and the maintained value must be recouped before another distribution can be made. Since the commencement of FTF there have been four years in which distributions were made. The FTF has distributed $6.4 million with some $5.3 million allocated to island development (the balance of $1.1 million is held in reserve by the communities). This equates to an average of $55,000 spent per island per year.|$|E
25|$|Villages {{generally}} {{provide their}} own fire protection, but joint town-village fire districts are permitted. A Joint Fire District is a fire district that encompasses {{more than one}} town, wholly or in part, and may also include a village. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> times done to reduce duplication of services in a small area or to help spread the tax burden {{when there is a}} large difference in tax base between neighboring towns. A joint fire district may also be formed when a fire department in a village that has fire protection districts in the surrounding towns separates itself from the village government to obtain greater self-governance. This was seen in 2003 when the fire department in the village of Baldwinsville formed a joint fire district consisting of the village of Baldwinsville and parts of the towns of Lysander and Van Buren in Onondaga County.|$|E

500|$|Black and Means {{discover}} that they have both been sent to investigate by the Group, realizing that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> kind of test for them. They both {{come to believe that}} Barkabow, from whom Black senses a demonic presence, is responsible for Wells' death, and visit her home. Means speaks to Barkabow's mother while Black interviews the child. As they speak, Barkabow begins screaming and accuses Black of harming her; after he leaves the room she hits herself in the face and breaks her jaw. [...] This leads Roberts, who learns that Black is under suspicion of harming Jordan, to arrest him for assault. [...] Means has ultraviolet photographs taken of Barkabow's injuries, deduces that the girl was injured with an angel statue from her room. Means realizes that Black could not have wielded this statue, and Barkabow's mother admits to having heard her daughter hit herself. Black is released, and the Seattle investigation against him is dropped when Catherine defends him. [...] The Black family and Lara return to Seattle, while Barbakow is adopted by a family of the Millennium Group.|$|E

2500|$|Last Train to Paris {{is officially}} {{credited}} to Diddy – Dirty Money. The group was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member, Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside {{him on the}} album. In an interview with All Hip-Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is [...] "not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative". Instead he described it as [...] "a sound, a movement, [...] a crew", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that [...] "he wanted to tell a love story" [...] but needed Dirty Money because [...] "he couldn’t just tell the male’s point of view." [...] Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at [...] "a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, {{and all of a}} sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. I was sitting there with a bunch of money and I was like, 'Damn, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as [...] "fleshing out Last Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money [...] "sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing", on the disk. [...] Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album [...] "attitude and style". He said [...] "the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand." [...] David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as [...] "fine background singers or part of Diddy’s Fashion Week posse." [...] Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, [...] "Diddy takes a backseat" [...] which allowed [...] "Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of the heavy lifting (and breathing) on a wide range of songs." [...] Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he [...] "wanted to flip things" [...] by having two girls and one guy in the band. [...] "Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me". He told Amos Barshad from New York that [...] " [...] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace." ...|$|E
