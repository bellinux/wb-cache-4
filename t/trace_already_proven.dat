In this paper we show Deligne’s category admits a unique nontrivial family of modified trace functions. Such modified <b>trace</b> functions have <b>already</b> <b>proven</b> to be interesting in both low-dimensional topology and representation theory. We also introduce a graded variant of Deligne’s category, lift the modified trace functions to the graded setting, {{and use them to}} recover the well-known invariant of framed knots known as the writhe. 1...|$|R
