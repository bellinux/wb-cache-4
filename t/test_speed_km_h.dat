40|$|Previous {{researchers}} have identified {{significant differences between}} laboratory and road cycling performances. To establish the ecological validity of laboratory time-trial cycling performances, the causes of such differences should be understood. Hence, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to quantify differences between laboratory- and road-based time-trial cycling and to establish to what extent body size [mass (m) and height (h) ] may help to explain such differences. Twenty-three male competitive, but non-elite, cyclists completed two 25 mile time-trials, one in the laboratory using an air-braked ergometer (Kingcycle) and the other outdoors on a local road course over relatively flat terrain. Although laboratory speed was a reasonably strong predictor of road speed (R 2 69. 3 %), a significant 4 % difference (P 5 0. 001) in cycling speed was identified (laboratory vs. road speed: 40. 4 + 3. 02 vs. 38. 7 + 3. 55 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71; mean + s).

In the systems model, performance at any given point in time is seen as the difference between two antagonistic components, fitness and fatigue, which represent {{the positive and negative}} adaptation to training, respectively. Each component comprises a set of parameters unique to the individual, which were estimated by fitting model-predicted performance to performance measured weekly throughout a 12 -week training period. The model fitness component was correlated with extrapolated VO 2 max (ml. kg 1. min 1), running economy (RE) (VO 2 at 17 <b>km.</b> <b>h</b> 1), and running <b>speed</b> (<b>km.</b> <b>h</b> 1) at ventilatory threshold (VTRS). The model fatigue component was correlated with the fatigue subset of the profile of mood states (POMS). The fit between model and actual performance was signifi- cant (r 2 = 0. 92, P< 0. 01).

40|$|Many {{researches}} in {{the world}} deal with driving {{on the road to}} ensure optimum safety. In this context, several telecommunication technologies are often used to connect the vehicles via continuous wireless communication with the infrastructure, exchange data and information relevant to increase overall road safety and enable cooperative traffic management. These systems are not reliable for all situations and the difficulties encountered by the drivers. We have been proposed the Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency- Division Multiplexing system based on Ultra Wide Band (MB-OFDM UWB) as a good candidate to insure a Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I) communication with high data rate and good performances in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). However, Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) resulting from Doppler shift phenomenon degrades MB-OFDM UWB system performance and raises a significant challenge in wireless mobile environment. In this study, V 2 I communication based on the MB-OFDM UWB technology is studied and analyzed for 200 Mbit/s, over multipath channel using the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a channel model with Doppler shift for different speeds. The theoretical formulas of BER in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels are calculated and are compared to the simulation results in MB-OFDM UWB system. The comparison shows that simulation results are consistent with theoretical formulas. The degradation in the performance of the proposed system solution becomes worse with a high <b>speed</b> 250 <b>Km</b> <b>h</b> - 1, so itâs necessary to use new receiver solutions.

Species that rely heavily on walking often have high capacities for aerobic metabolism relative to species that rely primarily on saltation. We tested the hypothesis of co-adaptation of gait and aerobic metabolism by investigating the locomotor energetics of Bufo boreas halophilus, a toad that walks, but does not hop. Rates of oxygen consumption during locomotion were measured in an enclosed variable-speed treadmill. The steady-state rate of oxygen consumption (V˙O•ss) increased linearly within a range of sustainable speeds [V˙O•ss (ml O 2 g 21 h 21) = 0. 93 3 <b>speed</b> (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) + 0. 28]. The minimum cost of transport, Cmin (the slope of this relationship), varied significantly among individual toads. When expressed in units of oxygen consumed per distance travelled (ml O 2 km 21), Cmin scaled isometrically with body mass: Cmin = 0. 69 mass 1. 07. Consequently, mass-specific Cmin (ml O 2 g 21 km 21) was uncorrelated with body mass. Variation in Cmin was also unrelated to experimental temperature. Mass-specific Cmin estimates were similar to previous allometric predictions for terrestrial animals of similar size, which contrasts with previous findings for another toad species. Maximum rates of oxygen consumption measured in closed, rotating respirometers were significantly higher than the maximum rates achieved on the treadmill, but lower than those measured previously in other Bufo species. Our results indicate that walking is not necessarily a costly gait for toads and that high maximum rates of oxygen consumption are not associated with reliance on walking within the genus Bufo...|$|R

The heat dissipation capacity of the head and neck, estimated from measurements made at a wind <b>speed</b> (100 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) corresponding to fast flight, was 9. 8 W, or 4. 5 times the resting heat production. Since the greater part of this capacity, about 8 W, was attributable to the inner surfaces of the mouth, ram ventilation of the buccal cavity appears to be an important mechanism for increasing evaporative heat loss during flight. Accordingly, wind-assisted mouth cooling should be utilized by resting pigeons, since exposure to a slight breeze (approximately 10 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) could augment their dissipating power by an amount equivalent to their resting metabolic rate.

The emission composition and emission factors of NMHCs from vehicles are currently lacking in Hong Kong. In this study, speciation and emission factors of NMHCs emitted from gasoline-fuelled private cars and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) -fuelled taxis at different driving speeds were constructed using a chassis dynamometer. Large variations in the contributions of individual NMHC species to total emission were observed for different private cars at different driving speeds. The variations of individual NMHC emissions were relatively smaller for taxis due to their relatively homogeneous year of manufacture and mileages. Incomplete combustion products like ethane, ethene and propene were the major component of both types of vehicles, while unburned fuel component was also abundant in the exhausts of private cars and taxis (i. e. i-pentane and toluene for private car, and propane and butanes for taxi). Emission factors of major NMHCs emitted from private cars and taxis were estimated. High emission factors of ethane, n-butane, i/n-pentanes, methylpentanes, trimethylpentanes, ethene, propene, i-butene, benzene, toluene and xylenes were found for private cars, whereas propane and i/n-butanes had the highest values for taxis. By evaluating the effect of vehicular emissions on the ozone formation potential (OFP), {{it was found that the}} contributions of olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons to OFP were higher than that from paraffinic hydrocarbons for private car, whereas the contributions of propane and i/n-butanes were the highest for taxis.

This colony {{is located at}} more than 500 km from the main fishing grounds of a very important industrial purse-seine fishery targeting surface-dwelling tunas. Despite their slow flight <b>speeds</b> (16 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 1), frigatebirds are able to forage at more than 1000 km from the colonies when breeding, using 2500 – 4750 km long foraging loops over oceanic waters. All trips were directed {{to the north of}} the island up to the equator. Foraging bouts, indicated by reduced flight speeds, were rare and located throughout the trips. Foraging spots tended to be more frequent on higher surface chlorophyll concentration and in association with some cyclonic vortices. However, mesoscale activity is relatively weak between Aldabra and the equator and the chlorophyll variability is mostly the result of wind-mixing processes during the southwest monsoon. These results suggest that frigatebirds forage for widely distributed resources to the north of Aldabra. The northernmost foraging bouts were located in the vicinity of the purse-seine fishing grounds, but without a significant overlap between frigatebirds and tuna fleets. The results of the study are compared with those from another population at Europa Island (22. 3 S, 40. 3 E) where birds were foraging on predictable features, the edge of cyclonic eddies that are marked in the Mozambique Channel.

40|$|Seabed logging {{is a new}} {{technology}} being implemented for deep target exploration. The technology uses electromagnetic (EM) wave where an antenna transmits EM wave into water layer underneath seabed and with resistivity characteristics of hydrocarbon reservoir, the wave is reflected and received by the detectors on the seafloor. However, the roughness of the sea caused by underwater sea current limits the transmission of EM wave. EM wave itself has its own attenuation in seawater that is 102 dBm and the underwater sea current has made it worst. In seabed logging technology, the vessel is towing the transmitter at a very slow <b>speed</b> (1. 5 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> - 1) with high EM wave energy for transmitting the waves of ~ 1250 A cm - 2. Due to this large current more heat is generated. In this project, we propose an EM wave guide amplifier {{to be used to}} overcome these problems. The EM wave guide amplifier amplifies the wave without modifying the transmitter (antenna) circuit. Therefore lower energy is required for the transmitter and is sufficient for seabed logging technology. The thermionic cathode and molybdenum (Mo) anode with work function of 1 eV are selected to get higher amplification of EM wave. It is found that potential difference between the cathode and anode improves the electron acceleration in the wave guide amplifier. It has been observed that with the use of wave guide amplifier and with 20 Vpp supply to the transmitter at 5 MHz frequency, the wave received by receiver has been amplified up to 170 %. The application of this new method in seabed logging shall reduce the heat generated and overcome the EM wave attenuation problems...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{vehicles}} are exclusively {{used on the}} three lines. The first two lines because of their winding routes are operated with class 612 tilting trains, mostly in sets of three. From December 2004, services on the Schweinfurt-Nuremberg route were hauled at first by class 111 locomotives with five double-deck carriages (built in 1997), but with a top <b>speed</b> of 140 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> only. However, the one-hour service required to allow regular connections to and from trains on the Erfurt-Würzburg line made trains with a stop <b>speed</b> of 160 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> necessary. DB Regio therefore procured eight new five-car sets, which have been hauled since December 2005 by eight new class 146 locomotives, saving several minutes on the line. Regional-Express trains stop only at the stations of Bamberg, Haßfurt, Schweinfurt and Würzburg on the 100-kilometre route.|$|R
40|$|The quality fuel affects {{combustion}} {{because the}} fuel quality {{will get better}} combustion. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} improve the quality of the fuel to produce combustion. Such an increase in the octane rating of the fuel can result in increased good quality of the fuel. One method used is the addition of natural additives in the fuel. Tests were performed using a motorcycle test engine 100 cc 4 -stroke is running test (road test and acceleration), and stationary testing. The test road test conducted by a distance of 10 km with an average <b>speed</b> of 50 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> test aims to get the value of fuel consumption. Furthermore, using the acceleration <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> 0 - 80 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> and 40 - 80 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> which aims to get the fastest acceleration time. Then the stationary testing done on rotation 1. 000 rpm and 3. 000 rpm with a 5 -minute aims to get the value of fuel consumption at rest. This test uses a natural variation in the dose of the gasoline additive used is 1 : 4, 1 : 6, 1 : 8, and 1 : 10. On testing fuel consumption with the distance 10 km can be seen that the concentration of 1 : 6 is the best concentration that can reduce fuel consumption by 23, 31 % (136 ml), compared with natural gasoline without additives (177, 333 ml). Average time acceleration 0 - 80 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> resulted in the concentration of the best natural additives 1 : 4 that is with an average acceleration of 10, 847 seconds (20, 69 %). In testing acceleration 40 - 80 <b>km</b> / <b>h</b> obtained for the concentration of 1 : 8 with an average acceleration of 6, 993 seconds (21, 83 %). Tests of stationary fuel consumption at 1, 000 rpm for 5 minutes in to the best performance at a concentration of 1 : 8 that is 33, 91 % (12, 667 ml) whereas at 3. 000 rpm stationary best performance is obtained at a concentration of 1 : 10 30, 71 % (14, 334 ml) ...|$|R

It is the {{successor}} to the Toyota 88C and the predecessor to the Toyota 89C-V. Like other Toyota-powered sports prototypes of the era, it was designed and built by Dome. The car was a new design, developed around the Toyota's R32V 3.2 L turbocharged V8 engine, who replaced the 88C's standard turbocharged Inline-4. The 88C-V competed in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship.|$|R
