5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The termination end is called <b>the</b> incoming <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. <b>The</b> outgoing <b>register</b> transmits forward MF tones to <b>the</b> incoming <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> incoming <b>register</b> transmits backward MF tones to <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> outgoing <b>register</b> detects backward MF tones arriving from <b>the</b> incoming <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> incoming <b>register</b> detects forward MF tones arriving from <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> outgoing <b>register</b> transmits <b>the</b> first signal, but from that point forward <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register</b> merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by <b>the</b> incoming <b>register.</b> (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register's</b> first push signal to <b>the</b> incoming <b>register</b> is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas <b>the</b> incoming <b>register's</b> pull signals, which request information from <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register,</b> are client-server, where the client is <b>the</b> incoming <b>register</b> and <b>the</b> server is <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register.)</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that only half of <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim {{this was due to}} recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E

In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> voters were recorded, even though the Hòa Hảo warlord Ba Cụt and his army had prevented voting.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, {{registered}} marketplace merchants had a {{very low}} social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding public office. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants {{were not allowed to}} own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.|$|E

5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to serfdom. Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to serfdom, and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to much political wrangling with regard {{to the size of the}} Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the Polish state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, they provided some light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Italian Heavy Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian Heavy Draft. The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts, about half of which were mares. <b>The</b> <b>registered</b> population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported.|$|E
