5|$|Six of the Pendle witches {{came from}} one of two families, each at the time headed by {{a woman in her}} eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her {{daughter}} Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both {{trying to make a living}} from healing, begging, and extortion.|$|E
25|$|Cathedrals {{are also}} {{traditionally}} places of pilgrimage, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> travel from afar to celebrate certain important feast days or {{to visit the}} shrine associated with a particular saint.

25|$|Many cathedrals {{are places}} of pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> travel {{in order to}} worship or venerate a holy object or the reliquary of a saint. Many cathedrals are {{regarded}} as places that have provided rewarding religious experiences, where prayers have been answered or miracles have taken place. Pilgrimage was particularly popular in the late medieval period. Some cathedrals such as Santiago de Compostela continue to attract pilgrims.|$|E

25|$|The Cagliari {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} since the Neolithic. It occupies a favourable position between the sea and a fertile plain and is surrounded by two swamps (which provides defence against attacks from the inland).

After a brief stop in Britain, most likely on the Scottish coast, {{they crossed the}} channel and landed in Brittany in 585. At Saint-Malo in Brittany, there is a granite cross bearing the saint's name <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> once came to pray for rain in times of drought.

25|$|People with {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage require supportive care, including {{blood pressure}} control if required. People are monitored {{for changes in}} the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible). A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location {{and the size of the}} hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit.|$|E
25|$|After the Reformation, Protestant groups {{continued}} to splinter, {{leading to a}} range of new theologies. The Enthusiasts were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the Methodists, the Quakers, and the Baptists. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with modernist ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the Nicene creed and Chalcedonian Creed. These included Unitarians and Universalists. A major issue for Protestants became the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> contribute to their salvation. The debate is often viewed as synergism versus monergism, though the labels Calvinist and Arminian are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the Synod of Dort.|$|E
25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, {{with higher levels of}} anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E

25|$|If {{significant}} use of bicycles {{for shopping}} trips {{is to be}} achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in predatory pricing practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|E

500|$|The Tribal {{assembly}} (...) {{dates from}} time immemorial, as no ancient historian mentions its establishment. In the early Republic, {{there were four}} urban tribes and 17 rural tribes. In 241BC fourteen rural tribes were added, bringing the total to thirty-five. The 'tribes' were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather a district <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> were assigned. A citizen's tribe was inherited from his father, and only changed upon adoption or reallocation in the census; over time, this meant that tribal affiliation had little relationship to a citizen's home or even place of birth. The vast majority of legislation was enacted in the comitia tributa, which also elected quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes.|$|E

500|$|Immediately upon {{entry into}} the {{national}} park, {{a fork in the}} main path begins a trail running through the inner peninsula leading to a local cavern known as the Cave of Zeus (...) [...] The entrance is dense in vegetation, covering parts of it. There is also a wishing tree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> usually tie objects and belongings, hoping for their wishes to be granted. The Cave of Zeus is filled with clear subterranean spring water, making it another common tourist attraction near the national park. Visits to the cave typically increase as the waters of the nearby beaches become rougher, thereby making them less inviting. The cave's name invokes the many legends that concern the cave and its origins, including one holding that Zeus bathed in the cave.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{allegations}} made in the Pendle witch trials resulted {{from members of the}} Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it is implicit in much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, {{it may have been a}} trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about [...] away, near the village of Fence.|$|E
