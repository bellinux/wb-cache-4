5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> {{inhabited}} by the Proletheans, a religious extremist group, following her impregnation, Helena is {{introduced to the}} group's nursery where she bonds with a young girl. The Prolethean leader, Henrik Johanssen (Peter Outerbridge), impregnates his teenage daughter Gracie (Zoé de Grand'Maison) with his and Helena's embryos.

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of easy access to <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line {{increased the number of}} visitors, as the railroad featured <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E

5|$|The {{demands of}} {{managing}} <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> consume all of Chetwin's time, leaving Wilton to feel neglected and unloved. One day, a traveler is injured near <b>the</b> <b>ranch,</b> whom she recognizes as Pelham. Pelham courts her, {{taking advantage of}} her loneliness. Although she admits she does not love him, he convinces her to abandon her family and run away with him. As she is preparing to depart, she is confronted by Starlight, an Indian woman {{who works as a}} servant on <b>the</b> <b>ranch,</b> who reminds Wilton of the needs of her child. She spurns Pelham and returns to her family. Eventually, Chetwin forgives her and devotes more of his time to her. Pelham may have been killed by Starlight, although his ultimate fate is left unclear.|$|E

5|$|In the 1860s, {{a drought}} forced Del Valle {{to sell off}} much of his land, but he {{retained}} Camulos and prospered there. By {{the time of his}} death in 1880, he had expanded the house to twenty rooms, and the compound had become a self-sustaining ranch, complete with a brick winery, chapel, barn and workers' housing. Records indicate that in 1870 <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> was largest vintner in the area. A stagecoach line opened in 1874 and in 1887, Southern Pacific ran a rail line past <b>the</b> <b>ranch,</b> including a depot at Camulos, ending the ranch's isolation.|$|E
5|$|Rübel {{continued}} operating <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> in {{the same}} manner as the Del Valles, employing many of same workers. He had served in the American Field Service during World War I and when World War II broke out, he volunteered for active duty again. He died while serving in Tunisia in 1943. After his death, his widow Mary married a man named Edwin Burger, who was not as interested in maintaining the rancho. After Mary's death in 1968, Burger closed <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> entirely. The buildings and grounds were left untended for years. Rübel's heirs regained control of the property after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which had damaged a number of buildings on the rancho.|$|E

50|$|Isaac L. Ellwood came {{onto the}} scene after Texas was ravaged by terrible drought and blizzards during the late 1880s. Ellwood was {{co-owner}} of the barbed wire patent with Joseph Glidden. Ellwood bought <b>the</b> Spade <b>Ranch</b> from Evans and Warner during this time; along with his purchase came <b>the</b> <b>ranch's</b> unique brand and 800 head of cattle. Ellwood then purchased <b>the</b> sprawling Renderbrook <b>Ranch</b> from <b>the</b> Snyders and began to stock it with Spade cattle. In 1889, Ellwood acquired the 128,000-acre (518-km²) north pasture of <b>the</b> Snyder Brothers <b>ranch</b> and renamed it Spade <b>Ranch,</b> so <b>the</b> second Spade <b>Ranch</b> was born. Ellwood registered <b>the</b> <b>ranch's</b> distinctive brand in Mitchell County in 1889 and Hale and Lubbock Counties in 1891.|$|R

5|$|The younger Del Valle and {{his family}} did not live on <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> initially, instead {{settling}} in a house on what is now Olvera Street in Los Angeles. The Del Valle family did not move back to Camulos, which he had expanded, until 1861. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> was overseen by José Antonio Salazar, Del Valle's majordomo. Although the rancho was associated with Ramona and Mexican California, the house was not constructed until after the United States acquired the territory and California was admitted as a state. The Del Valle family never lived there under Mexican rule.|$|E
5|$|Agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and Archer Fordham (David Wilson Barnes) {{refuse to}} let Marston {{return to his}} family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down Dutch van der Linde (Benjamin Byron Davis), the leader of Marston's former gang. Marston learns that Dutch has been forming his own gang, and joins Ross, Fordham {{and a group of}} U.S. {{soldiers}} in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, Marston chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter commits suicide by backing off the cliff and falling to his death. Marston is released from his deal with Ross and returns to his ranch where his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack (Josh Blaylock) are waiting. Marston devotes his time tending to <b>the</b> <b>ranch,</b> having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. He is then suddenly forced to repel a surprise attack from a combined force of soldiers, lawmen and government agents led by Ross. Marston is able to fend off several waves of attackers and get his family to safety but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men, and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking <b>the</b> <b>ranch.</b>|$|E

Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of <b>the</b> <b>ranch.</b>|$|E

40|$|Duncan McNab McEachran's {{early history}} and {{involvement}} {{in the formation of}} the Montreal Veterinary College as well as in livestock inspection were reviewed. His contribution to the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>ranching</b> industry in western Canada was explored in detail. In 1881, McEachran helped to establish the Cochrane Ranche, which was <b>the</b> first great <b>ranch</b> to be started in southern Alberta. He was employed as <b>the</b> <b>ranch's</b> resident general manager until 1883, in which year <b>the</b> Waldrond <b>Ranch</b> was established. McEachran was this ranch's president and general manager until approximately 1909. During this time, he came under considerable criticism from both The MacLeod Gazette and The Calgary Herald. As Dr. McEachran maintained his obligations to <b>the</b> <b>ranches</b> while he was directing the veterinary college in Montreal as well as chief inspector of livestock for Canada, it was concluded that this feat alone would rank him as a remarkable historical figure...|$|R
