5|$|In September 2013, A {{bought the}} rights for an American {{remake of the}} French {{television}} series Les Revenants (<b>The</b> <b>Returned),</b> which is also about dead people coming back to life as they were before. Les Revenants, in turn, {{was inspired by a}} 2004 film of the same name directed by Robin Campillo and translated into English as They Came Back. When Seeley started working on Revival, a friend recommended he watch They Came Back to avoid similarities. Since <b>The</b> <b>Returned</b> is inspired by the film, he and Norton watched it and became fans of the show.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of <b>the</b> <b>returned</b> samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E

In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, <b>the</b> <b>returned</b> spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E

5|$|Bladin {{retired from}} the Air Force on 15October 1953, and was succeeded as AMP by Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock. Shortly after leaving the Air Force, Bladin donated an eponymous trophy for the service's best-performing Avro Lincoln unit in bombing and aerial gunnery competition. He ran a grazing property, which he named Adastra, at Yass, {{just north of the}} Australian Capital Territory. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, he also served as {{treasurer}} of <b>the</b> <b>Returned</b> Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became <b>the</b> <b>Returned</b> Services League in 1965. In the early 1960s he helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in Deepdene, Frank Bladin was buried at Springvale, Victoria.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>return</b> {{generating}} process {{underlying the}} South African stock market. The investigation of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process is framed within the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) framework with the APT reinterpreted {{so as to}} provide a conceptual framework within which <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process can be investigated. In modelling <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process, <b>the</b> properties of South African stock returns are taken into consideration and an appropriate econometric framework {{in the form of}} Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (ARCH) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) models is applied. Results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process of South African stock returns is described by innovations in multiple risk factors representative of several risk categories. The multifactor model of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process explains a substantial amount of variation in South African stock <b>returns</b> and <b>the</b> ARCH/GARCH methodology is an appropriate econometric framework for the estimation of models of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process. <b>The</b> APT framework is successfully applied to model and investigate <b>the</b> <b>return</b> generating process of South African stock returns...|$|R
5|$|After D-Day, Allied troops {{crossed the}} Belgian {{frontier}} on 1 September 1944. German forces {{did little to}} oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference. Although the King {{was no longer in}} the country, his Political Testament was presented to <b>the</b> <b>returned</b> Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The text reignited the divisions within the Government which had been largely hidden since earlier in the war.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} home McCann became a {{barrister}} {{and formed a}} legal partnership with Victoria Cross recipient Arthur Blackburn. McCann was active in returned servicemen's organisations, serving {{as president of the}} South Australian branch of <b>the</b> <b>Returned</b> Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League from 1924 to 1931, and as a state vice-president during 1938–1949. He was also a foundation member of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, looking after the dependents of deceased servicemen. He served in the part-time Citizen Military Forces, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel and commanding the 43rd Battalion between 1927 and 1930. He was state prices commissioner and deputy Commonwealth prices commissioner from 1938 to 1954, and in 1946 an arson attack on his home was linked to his anti–black marketeering work in those roles. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935, and a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1956. Both awards were for his services to the ex-service community.|$|E

The subsequent battle between Prime and Sixshot exposes the Transformers to the world at large and forces the military to call in a carpet bombing strike. The Autobots escape, but Verity and Jimmy are seemingly killed. Elsewhere, Hot Rod and Wheeljack set out to recover Ironhide's body, but are confronted by the Machination's Headmaster army, only escaping due to Wheeljack's gadgets. Hunter escapes his captors and discovers the decapitated but still living head of Sunstreaker. Sunstreaker reveals his mind is being used as the hub for the Machination's army, and Hunter opts to fight back, becoming a Headmaster himself. The Reapers arrive at Earth, attacking the Decepticon base and forcing Megatron to recall Sixshot, while Nova Prime (now known as Nemesis Prime), concerned at the pace of events, dispatches Galvatron to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain. In the following months {{he wrote his}} account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial of responsibility for the Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London.
