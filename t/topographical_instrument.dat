40|$|Cartographic heritage” is {{different}} from “cartographic history”. The second term refers {{to the study of}} the development of surveying and drawing techniques related to maps, through time, i. e. through different types of cultural environment which were background for the creation of maps. The first term concerns the whole amount of ancient maps, together with these different types of cultural environment, which the history has brought us and which we perceive as cultural values to be preserved and made available to many users (public, institutions, experts). Unfortunately, ancient maps often suffer preservation problems of their analog support, mostly due to aging. Today, metric recovery in digital form and digital processing of historical cartography allow preserving map heritage. Moreover, modern geomatic techniques give us new chances of using historical information, which would be unachievable on analog supports. In this PhD thesis, the whole digital processing of recovery and elaboration of ancient cartography is reported, with a special emphasis on the use of digital tools in preservation and elaboration of cartographic heritage. It is possible to divide the workflow into three main steps, that reflect the chapter structure of the thesis itself: •	map acquisition: conversion of the ancient map support from analog to digital, by means of high resolution scanning or 3 D surveying (digital photogrammetry or laser scanning techniques); this process must be performed carefully, with special instruments, in order to reduce deformation as much as possible; •	map georeferencing: reproducing in the digital image the native metric content of the map, or even improving it by selecting a large number of still existing ground control points; this way it is possible to understand the projection features of the historical map, as well as to evaluate and represent the degree of deformation induced by the old type of cartographic transformation (that can be unknown to us), by surveying errors or by support deformation, usually all errors of too high value with respect to our standards; •	data elaboration and management in a digital environment, by means of modern software tools: vectorization, giving the map a new and more attractive graphic view (for instance, by creating a 3 D model), superimposing it on current base maps, comparing it to other maps, and finally inserting it in GIS or WebGIS environment as a specific layer. The study is supported by some case histories, each of them interesting from the point of view of one digital cartographic elaboration step at least. The ancient maps taken into account are the following ones: •	three maps of the Po river delta, made at the end of the XVI century by a famous land-surveyor, Ottavio Fabri (he is single author in the first map, co-author with Gerolamo Pontara in the second map, co-author with Bonajuto Lorini and others in the third map), who wrote a methodological textbook where he explains a new <b>topographical</b> <b>instrument,</b> the squadra mobile (mobile square) invented and used by himself; today all maps are preserved in the State Archive of Venice; •	the Ichnoscenografia of Bologna by Filippo de’ Gnudi, made in the 1702 and today preserved in the Archiginnasio Library of Bologna; it is a scenographic view of the city, captured in a bird’s eye flight, but also with an icnographic value, as the author himself declares; •	the map of Bologna by the periti Gregorio Monari and Antonio Laghi, the first map of the city derived from a systematic survey, even though it was made only ten years later (1711 – 1712) than the map by de’ Gnudi; in this map the scenographic view was abandoned, in favor of a more correct representation by means of orthogonal projection; today the map is preserved in the State Archive of Bologna; •	the Gregorian Cadastre of Bologna, made in 1831 and updated until 1927, now preserved in the State Archive of Bologna; it is composed by 140 maps and 12 brogliardi (register volumes). In particular, the three maps of the Po river delta and the Cadastre were studied with respect to their acquisition procedure. Moreover, the first maps were analyzed from the georeferencing point of view, and the Cadastre was analyzed with respect to a possible GIS insertion. Finally, the Ichnoscenografia was used to illustrate a possible application of digital elaboration, such as 3 D modeling. Last but not least, we must not forget that the study of an ancient map should start, whenever possible, from the consultation of the precious original analogical document; analysis by means of current digital techniques allow us new research opportunities in a rich and modern multidisciplinary context...|$|E

40|$|We {{provided}} {{new data}} on topography, morphology and physical/chemical parameters (pH, T, etc) collected in several tidepool-like morphologies along the Northwestern Istrian coast, between Savudrija (Salvore) and Zambratija (Zambrattia). 6 transects, each containing 4 - 5 tidepool-like morphologies, have been surveyed using <b>topographical</b> <b>instruments.</b> Higher pools highlight a smooth surface and, at the bottom, sub-rounded pebbles and locally terra rossa. Moving seaward, rounded pebbles prevail and biochemical/biophysical weathering increases surface roughness. The surveying {{suggests that the}} genesis of the studied shore morphologies is strongly controlled by geological weakness, in fact they are mainly developed along joints and axis of folds and interested by marine factors; the surface morphology depends on their elevation. Higher pools are interested mainly by inner karst factors and consequentially by marine spray, while the ones located in the mid- and low-tidal zone are interested by marine weathering, mainly biological...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{illustrates}} the procedures {{applied for the}} coordinate system conversion of the historical fumarole positions at La Fossa crater, to allow their comparison with newly acquired global positioning system (GPS) data. Due {{to the absence of}} ground control points in the field and on both the old Gauss Boaga and the new UTM WGS 1984 maps, we had to model the transformation errors between the two systems using differential GPS techniques. Once corrected, the maps show a residual Easting shifting, due to erroneous georeferencing of the original base maps; this is corrected by morphological comparative methods. The good correspondence between the corrected positions of the historical data and the results of the new GPS survey that was carried out in 2009 highlights the good quality of the old surveys, although they were carried out without the use of accurate <b>topographical</b> <b>instruments.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} DGPS (Digital Ground Positioning System) {{satellite}} antennas has become widespread {{within the framework of}} the historical-topographic research. They give us the possibility of geo-referencing, in a simple manner, different objects spread across the territory, and permit the delimitation and geometrical survey of specific areas rendered in the shape of polygons. In the present project, new case-studies, aimed at defining new procedures for the geo-referencing of territorial elements, are produced. In these case-studies the use of DGPS, employed in a new and integrated way with other modern <b>topographical</b> <b>instruments,</b> has enabled us to survey complex structures and to produce detailed morphological studies of the sites. The archaeological sites that have been examined show great differences. Firstly, in their geomorphologic characteristics, the historical period, the cultural environment and related problems and secondly, for the different scale of the research, procedures and level of investigation of the archaeological research...|$|R
40|$|Calamitous events cause {{modifications}} in soil morphology and damages in infrastructures. The {{knowledge of these}} modifications can be very useful for the Civil Protection operations. However, survey operations, {{even if they are}} supported by the most modern geomatic technologies, are still very difficult, if they are not impossible, because of the adverse operative conditions, like for examples: difficulties for moving in zones subjected to thunderstorms, or short sight conditions determined by volcanic eruptions. Not all of the usual surveying techniques, in these conditions, can be successfully applied. Therefore it is important to arrange instruments and methodologies for surveys, studied and tested for different scenarios, to front timely and effectually the need of the case. Among the most technologically advanced approaches, {{it is very important to}} quote laser scanning, very effective and quick to evaluate the damages suffered from operas and infrastructures (buildings, bridges, road embankments, [...] ), and multispectral images’ analysis, useful for the research of dispersed polluting substances owing to the spill of transported hazmat or for the environmental analysis related to the occur of fires or volcanic eruptions. The contribution of the techniques of aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, for the definition of the new morphology caused by remarkable hydro-geological damages, is always valid. Besides, it is important to avoid neglecting the new potentialities of the modern robotic <b>topographical</b> <b>instruments,</b> very useful for the traditional approaches for the soils and buildings, and of satellite positioning, that, especially in RTK modality, can find an application for the positioning of helps and even to individuate a perimeter for the interested areas (for example, landslides and flooded surfaces). In this paper it is proposed a wide overview of scenarios and thr consequently necessity of surveying that can be determined after calamitous events, with a particular attention to the effects induced by seismic events and hydro-geological damages, forest fires and volcanic eruptions; case by case, it is suggested, on the basis of precedent experiences achieved in this field, the most suitable techniques of surveying and of data management...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the first field-works in the temple of Niuserra at Abu Ghurab more than one hundred years from the discovery and publication of the temple by Borchardt. The sun temple built by Niuserra is the only one, out of the six temples known from the epigraphic sources, greatly preserved and whose structures are still recognizable. This new investigation is not based on new excavations of the temple but rather on a re-evaluation of the archaeological data still available on the site as well as an attempt to clarify the architectural and functional features of some of the structures and to suggest a new, revisited plan of the temple itself by means of the modern <b>topographical</b> and technological <b>instruments.</b> In this sense, attention has been particularly focused on the general measurements of the temple made by Borchardt and on some specific areas like, above all, the obelisk and the so-called “magazines” whose architectural layout and symbolical value seem to have been sometimes misinterpreted by the German scholar. After two archaeological campaigns it was possible to ascertain that, although Borchardt’s work in the temple still remains a key-point in the understanding and comprehension of the architectural features of such kind of religious buildings, many interesting archaeological data still need further, accurate investigation...|$|R
