5|$|The cysts of Azotobacter are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body.</b> <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>body</b> can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents {{of the outer shell}} are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
5|$|Germination of cysts is {{accompanied}} by changes in the intima, visible with an electron microscope. The intima consists of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and has almost the same volume as <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body.</b> During germination of cysts, the intima hydrolyses and {{is used by the}} cell for the synthesis its components.|$|E
5|$|English Freemasonry {{spread to}} France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, {{and then as}} distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the Moderns. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe {{during the course of}} the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who {{exercised}} only nominal authority. His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body</b> as the Grand Orient de France in 1773.

25|$|An {{accretion}} disk is a structure (often a circumstellar disk) formed by diffused material in orbital motion around a massive central body. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>body</b> is typically a star. Friction causes orbiting {{material in the}} disk to spiral inward towards <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body.</b> Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise {{the temperature of the}} material, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion disks of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared; those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum. The study of oscillation modes in {{accretion disk}}s is referred to as diskoseismology.|$|E

25|$|Under Newtonian physics, a {{two-body}} system {{consisting of}} a lone object orbiting a spherical mass would trace out an ellipse with the spherical mass at a focus. The point of closest approach, called the periapsis (or, because <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body</b> in the Solar System is the Sun, perihelion), is fixed. A number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the Sun. The principal cause {{is the presence of}} other planets which perturb one another's orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar oblateness.|$|E

25|$|His {{experience}} at Seminara {{taught him that}} more was required on the battlefield. The battle was lost primarily because Ferdinand, ignoring de Córdoba's advice, persisted in fighting a pitched battle with their more lightly equipped troops. In the open field, the loose formation and short swords of the Spanish infantry put them at a disadvantage against a charge of heavy cavalry and pikemen. De Córdoba introduced a closer formation, dividing the Spanish infantry among <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body</b> of pikemen and shooting wings. Known as a colunella, it was the original pike and shot formation. The French were expelled by 1498 without another battle, and he returned home.|$|E

25|$|If {{an orbit}} {{is about a}} {{planetary}} body with significant atmosphere, its orbit can decay because of drag. Particularly at each periapsis, the object experiences atmospheric drag, losing energy. Each time, the orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum. This {{is similar to the}} effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the highest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower. With each successive slowing more of the orbit's path is affected by the atmosphere and the effect becomes more pronounced. Eventually, the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect. When this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
