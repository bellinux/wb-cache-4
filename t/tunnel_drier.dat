40|$|Abstract—Tomato powder {{has good}} {{potential}} as substitute of tomato paste and other tomato products. In {{order to protect}} physicochemical properties and nutritional quality of tomato during dehydration process, investigation was carried out using different drying methods and pretreatments. Solar drier and continuous conveyor (<b>tunnel)</b> <b>drier</b> were used for dehydration where as calcium chloride (CaCl 2), potassium metabisulphite (KMS), calcium chloride and potassium metabisulphite (CaCl 2 +KMS), and sodium chloride (NaCl) selected for treatment [...] lycopene content, dehydration ratio, rehydration ratio and non-enzymatic browning in addition to moisture, sugar and titrable acidity were studied. Results show that pre-treatment with CaCl 2 and NaCl increased water removal and moisture mobility in tomato slices during drying of tomatoes. Where CaCl 2 used along with KMS the NEB was recorded the least compared to other treatments and the best results were obtained while using the two chemicals in combination form. Storage studies in LDPE polymeric and metalized polyesters films showed less changes in the products packed in metallized polyester pouches and even after 6 months lycopene content did not decrease more than 20 % {{as compared to the}} control sample and provide extension of shelf life in acceptable condition for 6 months.

40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} casein drying have been {{investigated}} to provide relevant information for design, operation and control of industrial casein driers. Casein desorption isotherms were sigmoid in shape and of type II according to the BET classification. A modified Henderson equation could describe the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of casein {{as a function of}} water activity (equilibrium relative humidity) and temperature. Under similar drying conditions, the EMC of casein decreased in the order mineral acid > rennet > lactic. Studies on mineral acid casein indicated that the EMC was not affected by wet processing conditions but more severe drying conditions caused a significant decrease. Drying mechanisms were studied in a laboratory <b>tunnel</b> <b>drier</b> and a fluidized bed drier. The batch drying curve in the <b>tunnel</b> <b>drier</b> consisted of a short constant rate period (CRP) and two linear falling rate periods (FRP). The critical moisture content was about 1. 5 kg water/kg dry solids. In contrast the batch drying curve in the fluidized bed drier had a long constant rate period down to a critical moisture content of around 0. 5 kg water/kg dry solids, followed by a single linear falling rate period. The effects of drying conditions and casein manufacturing conditions were studied in the fluidized bed drier. The CRP drying rate was directly proportional to the air temperature driving force. The FRP drying rate also increased with an increase in air temperature. An increase in air velocity caused an increase in the CRP drying rate but did not affect the drying rate in the FRP. A rise in casein precipitation pH from 4. 3 to 4. 8 caused a significant reduction in the CRP drying rate but had only a small effect on the FRP drying rate. The precipitation and hot wash temperatures of casein curd had no significant effect on the drying rates. Curd plasticization did not affect the drying rate in the CRP but increased the FRP drying rate. In the CRP, larger particles (> 2. 00 mm) tended to dry more slowly than smaller particles because of reduced fluidization efficiency, but particle sizes ranging from 0. 50 to 3. 35 mm did not appear to affect drying rates in the FRP. In general the CRP was affected by factors which altered the gas phase heat and mass transfer whereas the FRP tended to be influenced by factors affecting the solid phase heat and mass transfer. Measurements in a commercial plant indicated that bigger casein particles leaving the drier had significantly higher moisture contents than the smaller particles. Moisture equilibration between the big and small particles was reached in about 3 hours. Studies on drying of single casein particles indicated that lactic casein particles had higher air contents than rennet casein and mineral acid casein particles when drying from a mean initial MC of 1. 2 kg water/kg dry solids to a final MC of 0. 02 kg water/kg dry solids. This caused particle shrinkage of about 40 % for all three types of casein which was brought about by both evaporation of moisture and contraction of the casein matrix. Below about 0. 40 kg water/kg solids, the casein matrix no longer contracted significantly and the voids left by the evaporating moisture became air pores. A pulsed NMR technique was used to obtain the self diffusion coefficient (D) and transverse relaxation time (T 2) of water in mineral acid, lactic and rennet casein particles, as well as the moisture distribution images within mineral acid casein particles. The self diffusion coefficient and transverse relaxation time for all casein types decreased with decreasing moisture content. But at the same moisture content the T 2 values for acid caseins were much higher than for rennet casein. This may be attributed to the extra mineral content of rennet casein. The maximum self diffusion coefficient of water within a casein particle was about 25 % that of pure water. The T 2 of pure water was about 200 times that for acid caseins and 750 times for rennet casein. Moisture equilibration between particles took about 3 hours to reach an equilibrium D value which compares well with the value above. The proton density image within a wet casein particle showed regions of high moisture content and some regions of very low moisture content which may be air gaps. The effects of temperature and time on casein colour and casein solubility in alkali were studied for a range of moisture contents. In general low moisture samples were more soluble than high moisture samples. However for holding temperatures up to 100 °C and holding time up to 2 hours, the maximum insolubility of casein occurred at a moisture concent of around 0. 43 kg water/kg dry solids. Casein colour was not affected by holding temperatures of up to 100 °C at holding times of up to one hour. However a 2 hour holding time at 100 °C caused severe discoloration of casein. The implications of these results for commercial casein drying are discussed and a new design concept for casein dry processing is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Shrimp chips {{included}} {{the food that}} liked by many people. Shrimp chips are chips with the protein. The types of shrimp that use in this research are the white shrimp (Panaeus mergulensis) and small shrimp. White shrimp (Penaeus merguiensis) is shrimp that have color white and have a thin skin, but small shrimp is shrimp with small size. Economic value of small shrimp is low, but if processed into shrimp chips, it will increase that economic value. Shrimp chips furthermore dried, drying method that used is with solar <b>tunnel</b> <b>drying</b> and sun drying method. The sun drying method has many weaknesses, because of that we use solar tunnel dryer to reduce water content of product at the lowest level, so the shelf life will increase, and significantly can reduce the drying time because the inside temperature at solar tunnel dryer higher than outside. The shelf life of product can estimate by ASLT technical (Accelerated Shelf Life Test), this technical can do fastly with extend stimulate extreme treatment, and the yield can used to detect quality decline during storage. This research do to know {{the effect of the}} use of white shrimp and small shrimp and the use of sun <b>drying</b> and solar <b>tunnel</b> <b>drying</b> method, to drying rate of shrimp chips and the quality (include shelf life) of shrimp ships from chemical aspect are water content (analyze by thermogravimetri method) and protein content (analyze by Kjeldahl method); physic aspect are percentage of expansion and the texture analyzed by texture analyzer; microbiological aspect include total colony bacteria and mold that analyzed by total plate count method; and sensory aspect. The shelf life of shrimp chips estimate by accelerated shelf life test method. The best drying rate of shrimp chips is small shrimp chips that <b>dried</b> by solar <b>tunnel</b> dryer. Solar tunnel dryer can accelerate the time of drying about two hours. From the analysis small shrimp chips that <b>dried</b> by solar <b>tunnel</b> dryer have the highest protein content that is 24. 7367...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the properties of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) exposed to convective air drying and freeze-drying. The samples were analyzed in terms of physical properties (colour and texture). The trials in the convective chamber were done at 40 ºC and 60 ºC, in the <b>drying</b> <b>tunnel</b> at 60 ºC and in the freeze dryer at - 50 ºC. It was concluded that the freeze drying and the air drying at 40 ºC produced smaller changes in the colour while the <b>drying</b> in the <b>tunnel</b> originated more intense colour changes. With respect to texture, {{it was possible to}} deduce that the pulp in the fresh product at 2 cm off from the skin is harder than the pulp at 4 cm off from the skin. As to the effect of drying in the texture of the pumpkin, it was observed that all dryings affected texture considerably when compared to the fresh product. In fact, hardness varied from 75 % in the drying in chamber at 40 ºC to 90 % in the <b>tunnel</b> <b>drying,</b> when compared to the fresh product. As to springiness, it was changed more in the drying at 40 ºC, while cohesiveness showed the higher change in the freeze drying treatment...|$|R

40|$|Pears of S. Bartolomeu variety {{have been}} used {{over the years in}} Portugal to produce a {{traditional}} dried pear using the cheapest practice with environmental friendly characteristics: open-sun drying. However, the obvious disadvantages concerning the drying efficiency and safety of the dried product have been an incentive to design or improve solar drying methods {{as an alternative to the}} traditional one. The present work has tested three types of drying processes, namely solar stove, solar <b>drying</b> and <b>tunnel</b> <b>drying.</b> In addition, the efficiency of drying and the properties of the dried pears were compared with the traditional dried fruits. The results of the tests have allowed us to conclude that all methods have lead to a considerable reduction in drying time as compared to open-sun drying. Indeed, the drying time for the solar stove and the solar dryer showed a reduction of 40 % while in the <b>drying</b> <b>tunnel</b> this reduction increased to 60 %. In addition, it was also possible to conclude that the properties of the dried pears obtained by the three processes correspond to a dried fruit similar to the traditional dried pears. Thus, based on these results, it can be inferred that the traditional sun drying at open-air can be replaced by either of the processes tested in the present study, which, allow a higher drying efficiency associated to a higher safety of the dried food, while maintains the properties of the traditional food product...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{finite element}} {{techniques}} {{to investigate the}} performance of buried tunnels subjected to surface blasts incorporating fully coupled Fluid Structure Interaction and appropriate material models which simulate strain rate effects. Modelling techniques are first validated against existing experimental results and then used to treat the blast induced shock wave propagation and <b>tunnel</b> response in <b>dry</b> and saturated sands. Results show that the tunnel buried in saturated sand responds earlier than that in <b>dry</b> sand. <b>Tunnel</b> deformations decrease with distance from explosive in both sands, as expected. In {{the vicinity of the}} explosive, the tunnel buried in saturated sand suffered permanent deformation in both axial and circumferential directions, whereas the <b>tunnel</b> buried in <b>dry</b> sand recovered from most of the axial deformation. Overall, response of the tunnel in saturated sand is more severe for a given blast event and shows the detrimental effect of pore water on the blast response of buried tunnels. The validated modelling techniques developed in this paper can be used to investigate the blast response of <b>tunnels</b> buried in <b>dry</b> and saturated sands...|$|R
50|$|The Carter H. Harrison Crib {{replaced}} the Two-Mile Crib in 1900, which was later {{replaced by the}} William E. Dever Crib built alongside it in 1935. As the demand increased for water {{this meant that the}} Harrison Crib continued in service until 1997. In 1998 the tunnels leading from the Harrison Crib to shore were drained for inspection, a process that was surrounded by controversy. Some experts feared that pumping the <b>tunnels</b> <b>dry</b> would result in a catastrophic collapse, while others guaranteed that collapse was not possible. Portions of the tunnel did in fact collapse. City lawyers soon filed suit against the engineers and contractors. The suit charged that the engineers, Alvord, Burdick & Howson, were negligent for advising the city that it was safe to drain the tunnels. It also charged that Luedtke Engineering Co., of Michigan, did the work in a way that caused the collapse. As a result, the city spent $5.3 million to fill in a portion of the tunnel under Lake Shore Drive to prevent a possible additional collapse.|$|R
