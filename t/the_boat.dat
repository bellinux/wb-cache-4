5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E

5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E

Eventually, most of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> had lost sight of each other and proceeding alone.|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} by Sotalia guianensis dolphins {{in the presence}} of touristic sea traffic in the bay of Curral, Pipa-RN, Brazil, were measured. The dolphins changed their behavior when boats were closer than 100 meters. The main behavioral alterations were that the dolphins remained submerged for longer and that they formed a more cohesive group as <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> came closer. Although we concluded that the approach of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> changed <b>the</b> dolphins’ behavioral pattern, {{we do not know what}} aspects of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> caused <b>the</b> avoidance.
