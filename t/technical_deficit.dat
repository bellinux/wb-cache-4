However, the clinical utility has not reach a consensus by the medical and genetic peers as well as third party payers. The predictive value and clinical applications are variable from one condition to the other. Numerous questions remain including technology deficits, data interpretation and unpredicted phenotypes in complex disorders. In this commentary, the authors reviewed the historical perspective of genetic testing and summarized the current <b>technical</b> <b>deficit,</b> clinical dilemma and suggested a few critical threshold to overcome before the implementation of useful genetic information in standard health care can become a reality...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: p. [274]- 285. This {{dissertation}} uses ethnographic {{material to}} critique South African adult literacy policy. Recent policy documents, I show identify people who lack {{six years of}} formal schooling, and particularly people in this position who are also classified as blacks, women and people in rural areas, as being in a deficit position. Not only are they regarded as illiterate and therefore having a <b>technical</b> <b>deficit,</b> but policy documents also describe their "illiteracy" as a marker of their social deficit as marginalised people. Policy makers argue that the deficit attributed to adult literacy target populations can be effectively redressed through formal literacy interventions. I indicate that policy makers' arguments are based on interpretations of statistics. that fail to reflect the complex forms of literacy and the multiple social identities {{of people in the}} "target population" and also on a theoretical approach to literacy and which dichotomizes the cognitive, social, cultural and linguistic attributes of "oral/illiterate" people and those of "literate" people...|$|E

30|$|This {{possibility}} {{is limited by}} important technical reasons. If the original examiner missed a lesion, no documentation exists of this. Thus, {{in the vast majority}} of cases, the only way to get a real second opinion is for the breast US examination to be repeated by another examiner. This underlines the importance of selecting quality-assured/certified breast imaging centres for the original breast US examination. Notably, this is not true for mammography, which can be read by a second radiologist without it being necessary to repeat the test, (with only few exceptions due to <b>technical</b> <b>deficits</b> of the original mammogram).|$|R
30|$|The {{detection}} of the <b>technical</b> <b>deficits</b> during the peer review {{and the special}} support of technicians is very important. The technical aspects of the examination critically influence the radiologists’ decision-making. A moderate correlation between the discrepancies and inadequate technique (correlation coefficient[*]=[*] 0.5, p[*]<[*] 0.05) or artifacts (correlation coefficient[*]=[*] 0.3, p[*]<[*] 0.05) for trauma cases was revealed. The technical problems most often detected were for pelvis MRI (55 %), i.e., patient and slice positioning (43 %), field-of-view selection (23 %), and pulse sequence selection (19 %) For CT, the most problematic areas are the neck and the larynx. Approximately 42 % of studies were performed with technical imperfections.|$|R

40|$|Governments {{around the}} globe are {{embracing}} Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to overcome financial and <b>technical</b> <b>deficit</b> and to provide public infrastructure on faster pace. However, PPPs are complex institutional arrangements involving many players from diversified fields and thus bringing more risk to the project. Numerous researches had been conducted to investigate potential risks and success factors for establishing PPPs. But, as appetite for transportation PPPs is increasing {{around the globe}}, more problems and partnership failures are being witnessed. Existence of such failures and faults, despite {{of the availability of}} scientific protocols, motivate the authors to investigate transportation PPPs failures in past two decades. The investigation led to the identification of forty eight potential failure reasons, responsible for transportation PPPs. The identification of “potential failure reasons” was made possible through thirty five transportation PPPs case studies. The investigation through case studies reveals that the adoption of PPPs in different regions was motivated by specific reasons besides fundamental financial and technical concerns. These specific reasons had played important roles in the project success and failure. This paper discusses the global trend of transportation PPPs in different economies with evidence of potential failure reasons and their causal relationships </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the context}} of a {{potential}} bioterrorist attack sensitive and fast detection of functionally active toxins such as ricin from complex matrices is necessary to be able to start timely countermeasures. One of the functional detection methods currently available for ricin is the endpoint cytotoxicity assay, which suffers from a number of <b>technical</b> <b>deficits.</b> Methodology/Findings: This work describes a novel online cytotoxicity assay for the detection of active ricin and Ricinus communis agglutinin, that is based on a real-time cell electronic sensing system and impedance measurement. Characteristic growth parameters of Vero cells were monitored online and used as standardized viability control. Upon incubation with toxin the cell status and the cytotoxic effect were visualized using a characteristic cell index–time profile. For ricin, tested in concentrations of 0. 06 ng/mL or above, a concentration-dependent decrease of cell index correlating with cytotoxicity was recorded between 3. 5 h and 60 h. For ricin, sensitive detection was determined after 24 h, with an IC 50 of 0. 4 ng/mL (for agglutinin, an IC 50 of 30 ng/mL was observed). Using functionally blocking antibodies, the specificity for ricin and agglutinin was shown. For detection from complex matrices, ricin was spiked into several food matrices, and an IC 50 ranging from 5. 6 to 200 ng/mL was observed. Additionally, the assay proved to be useful in detecting active ricin in environmental sample materials, as shown for organic fertilizer containing R. communis material. Conclusions/Significance: The cell-electrode impedance measurement provides a sensitive online detection method fo...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{exercise was}} carried out to assess the performance of Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) {{in the delivery of}} animal health care services in Karamoja region, identify capacity gaps and recommend remedial measures. Participatory methods were used to design data collection tools. Questionnaires were administered to 204 CAHWs, 215 farmers and 7 District Veterinary Officers (DVOs) to collect quantitative data. Seven DVOs and 1 Non Government Organization (NGO) representative were interviewed as key informants and one focus group discussion was conducted with a farmer group in Nakapiripirit to collect qualitative data. Questionnaire data was analyzed using SPSS version 19. Key messages from interviews and the focus group discussion were recorded in a notebook and reported verbatim. 70 % of the farmers revealed that CAHWs are the most readily available animal health care service providers in their respective villages. CAHWs were instrumental in treatment of sick animals, disease surveillance, control of external parasites, animal production, vaccination, reporting, animal identification, and performing minor surgeries. Regarding their overall performance 88. 8 %(191 / 215) of the farmers said they were impressed. The main challenges faced by the CAHWs were inadequate facilitation, lack of tools and equipments, unwillingness of government to integrate them into the formal extension system, poor information flow, limited technical capacity to diagnose diseases, unwillingness of farmers to pay for services and sustainability issues. CAHWs remain the main source of animal health care services in Karamoja region and their services are largely satisfactory. The <b>technical</b> <b>deficits</b> identified require continuous capacity building programs, close supervision and technical backstopping. For sustainability of animal health care services in the region continuous training and strategic deployment of paraprofessionals that are formally recognised by the traditional civil service to gradually replace CAHWs is recommended...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{compares the}} responses of Dhaka, Bangladesh and Kolkata, India to the serious challenges posed by climate change, particularly in the water sector. Drawing on the theories of "adaptation as development" and cross-case analyses of ongoing planning initiatives in these two bellwether cities, this dissertation explores the factors that promote or hinder successful climate action. This work identifies practical, less resource-intensive adaptation strategies suited to the context of urban South Asia, where the findings suggest that, given the absence of dedicated adaptation planning at the city level, the most effective approaches are those that integrate both development and adaptation criteria. Resources allocated for local development can thus simultaneously address adaptation needs without substantial additional investments. Moreover, since such efforts are already part of ongoing planning initiatives, they obviate {{the need for more}} extensive "specialized adaptation" planning and technical expertise. These actions may thereby reduce the vulnerabilities of urban residents in these most threatened regions of the world. Drawing upon over ninety in-depth interviews, primary documents, firsthand observation, relevant scholarship, and three emblematic, developmentally oriented project case studies that address the cities' most urgent climate risks in water, flood and wetlands management, this research proposes a "contingent adaptation" approach as best-suited to such resource-constrained environments. Such an approach has the ability to overcome inherent local resource constraints, institutional limitations, while increasing the likelihood of adoption of adaptation-oriented projects. This work identifies several factors-among them, developing collaborative partnerships to bridge <b>technical</b> <b>deficits,</b> reforming local organizational structures to generate internal resources, and building political consensus for climate action-as essential for successful climate adaptation. This work seeks to provide a theoretical framework for effectively implementing adaptation-related local planning initiatives while building broader support for substantial climate action. Such contingent adaptation approaches may thereby provide a blueprint for immediate, proactive, and cost-effective practical applications in similar cities in South Asia and in comparable developing regions. by Madhu Chhanda Dutta-KoehlerThesis (Ph.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a competência técnica de profissionais que atuam no cuidado em anticoncepção. MÉTODOS: Realizou-se pesquisa do tipo avaliativa, na área da saúde, em oito municípios do Estado do Ceará, de julho a setembro de 2003. Os dados foram coletados mediante entrevistas com 29 enfermeiros e 50 usuários do Programa Saúde da Família e observações feitas nas unidades de saúde. RESULTADOS: A maioria dos enfermeiros havia participado de alguma capacitação sobre anticoncepção e normas técnicas. No entanto, foi relatada a existência de barreiras profissionais pelos enfermeiros e outras foram identificadas pelos usuários, os quais mostraram a necessidade de melhor capacitação dos profissionais que atuam nessa área. Os enfermeiros reconheceram dificuldades, tanto na comunicação e informação quanto técnicas, no manejo dos anticoncepcionais. CONCLUSÕES: Há lacunas na competência profissional em anticoncepção que associadas a falta de sistematização do trabalho em equipe, geram distorções na qualidade da atenção. O trabalho em equipe foi caracterizado pela indefinição de atribuições e tarefas dos seus membros. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the technical competence of professionals carrying out {{activities related to}} contraceptive care. METHODS: Evaluative {{research in the field}} of health was conducted in eight districts of the State of Ceara from July to September 2003. Data was collected by means of interviews with 29 nurses working in the Family Health Care Program within these districts and 50 people being attended by this program. Observations of the Family Health Care Units were a complementary source of data within this study. RESULTS: The majority of nurses had received some form of training regarding contraception and the technical norms regulating their use. However, professional barriers were reported by the nurses and others were identified by lay persons being attended by the program, that indicate the need to provide better training for professionals engaged in this area of care. The nurses recognized they had deficits in information and communication skills as well as <b>technical</b> <b>deficits</b> in dealing with contraception. CONCLUSIONS: There are gaps in professional competence with regard to contraceptive care that, when associated to the lack of systematization of team work, generates distortions in the quality of care.

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that, subject to some <b>technical</b> conditions, the <b>deficit</b> process of an {{infinitely}} deep dam with a Markov chain input process and unit withdrawals has a limiting zero-modified geometric distribution. In this paper it is shown that, provided the state {{space of the}} input process is finite, the limiting distribution of the deficit process of a finite dam tends to the zero-modified distribution above as the capacity tends to infinity. A convergence rate is established when the input process is an independent sequence. When the input process is a semi-Markov chain we find a simple condition ensuring that the limiting deficit distribution is a zero-modified geometric distribution. Some results are obtained for infinitely deep, and high, dams when the input process is a first order discrete autoregressive process. Nearly all examples of Markovian input processes have linear conditional expectations. The final section is a brief expository essay on such processes and mentions some open problems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of apraxia, it has been {{suggested}} that the ability to use tools and objects in daily life depends not only on semantic knowledge about tool function and context of use but also on technical reasoning about mechanical properties of tools and objects. The aim of the present work was to assess tool use abilities regarding these hypotheses in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and reduced autonomy. Performance of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n = 31), semantic dementia (n = 16) and corticobasal syndrome (n = 7) was compared to that of healthy control participants (n = 31) in familiar tool use tasks, functional/contextual associations and mechanical problem solving. A conversion method was applied to data in order to avoid ceiling effects. Tool use disorders were found in all patient groups but the underlying reasons were different. Patients with semantic dementia had difficulties in imagining and selecting familiar tools due to the semantic loss but they performed in normal range in mechanical problem solving tasks. Interestingly, they performed better with only one tool and its corresponding object, which is interpreted as a partial compensation of semantic loss by spared technical reasoning. Patients with corticobasal syndrome exhibited the reverse pattern, that is, mechanical problem solving deficits without semantic loss. However, additional qualitative research is needed to disentangle the relative contributions of motor and <b>technical</b> reasoning <b>deficits</b> to this pattern. Both of these profiles were found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. For all that, these patients did not commit the same errors as stroke patients with left brain-damage documented in previous works. Several hypotheses are proposed to account for the specificity of tool use disorders in neurodegenerative diseases, and recommendations are provided to caregivers...|$|R
40|$|Using {{selected}} examples, {{the project}} outlines supplementary requirements for remediation in land recycling {{that go beyond}} existing stipulations of police law and administrative regulations, specialized statutory regional guidelines, future Federal Soil Conservation Law regulations and general development planning. In addition, the project will tackle all <b>technical</b> and legal <b>deficits</b> currently restraining optimized land recycling. Instruments and recommendations are prepared that show how deficits in the planning and implementation of land recycling projects can be detected and which measures have to be undertaken in order to optimally counteract these deficits. The methodical concept assumes that a complex operational structure constituting four equally important influencing variables - derelict land reclamation, profitability, utilization, and the law - is determinative in all land recycling projects. Recommendations for action take up these deficits and provide specific suggestions for streamlined and more efficient procedures in land recycling. They refer to existing statutory and professional instruments, organizational forms, and regulations and are to be considered recommendations for improved application and utilization of these instruments. They provide a guideline for project completion and suggestions for project initiation {{as well as for}} setting up a suitable project structure and for optimized target definition in land recycling. A check list was prepared to evaluate and assess land recycling projects. The check list provides the user with a fast and comprehensive outline of the processing status of all important operating areas in land recycling. A project analysis using the check list reveals deficits in project processing and the steps to be taken immediately. Used in conjunction with the recommendations for action, the check list is an instrument for the comprehensive and effective completion of land recycling projects. (orig.)

30|$|The {{major issue}} with the {{training}} program is that it focuses on skill enhancement before the start-up begins to ensure sustainable and assessable business planning and market preparation. Hence, a substantial aim of training {{is to improve the}} ability of the business founder to assess the new business option and to evaluate ongoing business development. Furthermore, training courses also intend to improve specific knowledge on topics related to business activities such as technical skills in accounting, finance and marketing. For this, the implementing regulation outlines rather homogenous requirements for the form and content related to the training seminars. In contrast, the use of the coaching program focuses on the period after start-up and allows for an inflow of external knowledge during the early stage business development. The major aim of this program is to allow for individual and context-specific support to overcome technical problems and to compensate specific <b>technical</b> and personal <b>deficits.</b> Furthermore, skill enhancement may also be relevant in this context since learning is allowed to be problem- and context-specific. Therefore, coaching not only improves the business development of the newly founded business but also fosters the individual’s ability to assess and manage the economic potential of the business concept in general. Coaching in this sense should be understood as a highly flexible tool that allows for the inclusion of external expertise in the post entry period. 9 Note that this implies a rather wide definition of coaching (e.g., Chrisman and McMullan 2004). Finally, discretionary start-up support can be characterized as having the highest degree of freedom in terms of the timing of the intervention, related topics and concerning the way this support is used. Nevertheless, it is plausible to assume that DSUS mainly focuses on incorporating external expertise for a new business venture (see above). Hence, DSUS may provide a mixture of the characteristics related to what is covered by the training and the coaching programs.|$|R
