50|$|At {{the other}} end of the spectrum, central {{matching}} removes much of the sequentially in the trade verification process because <b>the</b> <b>counterparties</b> involved input <b>the</b> relevant data independently and separately. The information is then validated and matched centrally and to a large extent synchronously. When the details match, settlement instructions are automatically sent to custodians and settlement agents. What is more, <b>the</b> <b>counterparties</b> receive updates on the status of trades processed through the system, with errors (and the need to take corrective action) being indicated if trades do not match.|$|R
25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, because <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> is contractually {{obligated to}} match the return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E
25|$|Clients hold {{a margin}} account with the exchange, {{and every day}} the swings {{in the value of}} their {{positions}} is added to or deducted from their margin account. If the margin account gets too low, they have to replenish it. In this way {{it is highly unlikely that}} the client will not be able to fulfill his obligations arising from the contracts. As the clearing house is <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> to all their trades, they only have to have one margin account. This is in contrast with OTC derivatives, where issues such as margin accounts have to be negotiated with all counterparties.|$|E

2500|$|Some general {{criticism}} of financial derivatives is also relevant to credit derivatives. [...] Warren Buffett famously described derivatives bought speculatively as [...] "financial {{weapons of mass}} destruction." [...] In Berkshire Hathaway's annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, [...] "Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of <b>the</b> <b>counterparties</b> to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, <b>the</b> <b>counterparties</b> record profits and losses—often huge in amount—in their current earnings statements {{without so much as}} a penny changing hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)." ...|$|R
50|$|Uncollateralised XCSs (that {{are those}} {{executed}} bilaterally without a credit support annex (CSA) in place) expose <b>the</b> trading <b>counterparties</b> to funding risks and credit risks.

2500|$|An {{investor}} {{can also}} purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) {{to sell the}} underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price. [...] In {{the event of a}} market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or [...] "strike") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.|$|E
2500|$|If {{both the}} {{borrower}} and lender are well-known {{and the market}} (or even worse, the news media) learns that the bank is selling the loan, then the sale {{may be viewed as}} signaling a lack of trust in the borrower, which could severely damage the banker-client relationship. [...] In addition, the bank simply may not want to sell or share the potential profits from the loan. By buying a credit default swap, the bank can lay off default risk while still keeping the loan in its portfolio. The downside to this hedge is that without default risk, a bank may have no motivation to actively monitor the loan and <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> has no relationship to the borrower.|$|E
2500|$|To hedge <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk of {{entering}} a CDS transaction, one practice {{is to buy}} CDS protection on one's counterparty. [...] The positions are marked-to-market daily and collateral pass from buyer to seller or vice versa to protect both parties against counterparty default, but money does not always change hands due to the offset of gains and losses by those who had both bought and sold protection. [...] Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the clearinghouse {{for the majority of}} trades in the US over-the-counter market, stated in October 2008 that once offsetting trades were considered, only an estimated $6billion would change hands on October 21, during the settlement of the CDS contracts issued on Lehman Brothers' debt, which amounted to somewhere between $150 to $360billion.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of allocating the counterparty-level credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) to the individual trades composing the portfolio. We show that this problem can be reduced to calculating contributions of the trades to the counterparty-level expected exposure (EE) conditional on <b>the</b> <b>counterparty's</b> default. We propose a methodology for calculating conditional EE contributions for both collateralized and non-collateralized counterparties. Calculation of EE contributions can be easily incorporated into exposure simulation processes that already exist in a financial institution. We also derive closed-form expressions for EE contributions under the assumption that trade values are normally distributed. Analytical results are obtained for the case when the trade values and <b>the</b> <b>counterparty's</b> credit quality are independent as well as when there is a dependence between them (wrong-way risk).

2500|$|Bond markets, unlike {{stock or}} share markets, {{sometimes}} {{do not have}} a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, market liquidity is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond [...] "in inventory", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.|$|E
2500|$|This {{worldwide}} primacy {{in trade}} {{would not have}} been possible if it only rested on Dutch primacy in the carrying trade. After all, one has to trade something. Even where <b>the</b> <b>counterparty</b> is primarily interested in gold and silver as means of exchange, as in South-East Asia, that specie must be earned by a surplus on the balance of payments with other trading partners. A surplus in [...] "invisibles", like shipping services, would not suffice to cover the enormous financing requirement of the spice trade. At first, the Dutch had little indigenous to offer, beyond herring and dairy products. But the industrial revolution of the early 17th century brought an industry into being that by the 1640s had matured enough to play an important part in Dutch exports. This industrial growth was partly innovation driven, stimulating all kinds of heretofore not seen mechanization, that greatly enhanced labor productivity, thereby driving down prices for Dutch products, even while nominal wages rose steeply at the same time. But the commerce-engendered Dutch control of many raw-material markets (like Spanish and Turkish raw wool, Swedish iron and copper, Ibero-American dyestuffs, Portuguese salt, French wine, Baltic grain, Scandinavian tar and wood, Caribbean sugar, American tobacco etc.) was an important factor in stimulating the booms of the industries that used those materials: textiles, guns, vinegar, shipbuilding, sugar and salt refining, tobacco blending, to name only a few. [...] The Dutch entrepot was therefore supplied by an important domestic industrial sector, and not limited to reexporting wares obtained abroad. Industry and commerce were in this period closely integrated (though in later stages of the Dutch economy they would become disaggregated again, when foreign protection and a structurally high real-wage level forced the decline of the Dutch industrial sector).|$|E

50|$|Under a {{repurchase}} agreement, the Federal Reserve (Fed) buys U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, or {{mortgage-backed securities}} from a primary dealer who agrees {{to buy them}} back within typically one to seven days; a reverse repo is the opposite.

50|$|One {{leg of the}} swap {{will pay}} an amount based upon the {{realized}} variance of the price changes of the underlying product.

The other leg of the swap will pay a fixed amount, which is the strike, quoted at the deal's inception. Thus the net payoff to <b>the</b> <b>counterparties</b> will be <b>the</b> difference between these two and will be settled in cash at the expiration of the deal, though some cash payments will likely be made along the way by one or <b>the</b> other <b>counterparty</b> to maintain agreed upon margin.|$|R
