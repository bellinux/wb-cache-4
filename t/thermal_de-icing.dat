50|$|From 1942 to 1959 {{he worked}} at the NACA (later NASA) Ames Research Center. There, he {{conducted}} flight research programs with <b>thermal</b> <b>de-icing</b> systems and wind tunnel tests of supersonic aerodynamic heating, internal and external aerodynamics. He was also a member of NACA Internal Aerodynamics Subcommittee and assistant head of the 1x3-foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel Branch. Early in his time at NACA, in 1942, he wrote a proposal to develop both a jet engine and a research aircraft to test it. Likely unaware of the work being done at NACA Langley, let alone of the top secret acquisition of the Whittle engine by Air Corps Chief Hap Arnold in the spring of 1941, Scherrer never managed to acquire the necessary support to continue his jet propulsion research.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the loss of efficiency associated with a heated-air <b>thermal</b> <b>de-icing</b> propeller both with and without internal flow. For the available data, measured efficiency losses are compared with the calculated losses and the agreement is found to be within the experimental accuracy of the data. The method presented may be used with reasonable accuracy to determine the net change in propeller efficiency due to the combined effects of the nozzle and internal flow if the characteristics of the propeller without nozzles are known.

50|$|The Let L-200 Morava light {{twin-engine}} transport was preceded {{in production}} at the Let factory by the license-built Aero Ae 45. In 1955 the newly created design team led by Ladislav Smrcek of the Czechoslovak State Aircraft Factory decided to proceed with a proprietary design for a more modern twin with seating capacity of five and powered {{by a pair of}} then new 210 hp Avia M 337 engines, but as they were not yet available, the prototype made do with the less powerful Walter Minor 6-III engines of 160 hp each. While maintaining similar characteristics of western twin engine aircraft of the time, updated features of the Morava included twin tails, standard <b>thermal</b> wing <b>de-icing</b> equipment and inverted inline engines.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} forming multi-functional graphene based surfaces capable of <b>thermal</b> heating for <b>de-icing</b> applications. Developmental ink layers are deposited onto composite laminate skin surfaces and used to melt the ice-skin interface by Joule heating while simultaneously developing a thermal strain in the skin structure to develop a shear stress to debond the ice-skin interface. The electrical properties, microstructure, processing parameters, heat transfer and electro-thermal response of the electrically conductive developmental ink layers are examined along with the change in shape of the composite structure with temperature. Initial de-icing tests are demonstrated. Application sectors for the multifunctional skins include exposed instrumentation housings, structural members exposed to extreme environments, such as wind turbines, and transport (aerospace). The opportunity to limit the extent of ice build-up on structures has broad application opportunities to provide light -weight structures with reduced material costs and fuel saving for mobile applications and improved performance for instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a runback {{water and}} ice {{prediction}} model is extended to anti-icing and <b>thermal</b> <b>de-icing</b> situations. The resulting coupled equations that govern thin-film flow, ice accretion, and heat conduction in the multilayered system substrate-ice-water are solved using an explicit finite volume approach. The procedure is {{implemented in the}} three-dimensional icing code ICECREMO 2, and both structured and unstructured grids can be considered. Numerical results are presented to compare the present code simulations to some data provided by other ice prediction codes and to show {{the capabilities of the}} present numerical tool...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{tool for}} the optimal design and characterization of multilayer transparent coatings is developed. The coatings consist of thermal control films or nanometric metallo-dielectric layers. Electromagnetic shielding, optical transmittance, heat control, and <b>thermal</b> <b>de-icing</b> are the multifunctional performances of the proposed coatings. A circuit approach is developed for the prediction of the shielding effectiveness of electrically small apertures loaded with the transparent coating. The hypotheses of electrically short planar structure and large cavity are assumed. Applications of the proposed procedure are carried out to {{the window of a}} building and of a transportation aircraft. Measured and computed spectra of the shielding effectiveness and optical transmittance are presented in the radio frequency range...|$|E
