25|$|The Tour de France has {{the major}} fault of {{dividing}} <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>right</b> {{down to the}} smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.|$|E

She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure out what she doesn’t know. I got to thinking about all of the ways that, over the past few months, the women of Genoa City have been, to use the lingo of Leaning In, the most popular non-fiction book in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>right</b> now, leaning out."
