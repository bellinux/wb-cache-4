5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with <b>the</b> <b>rank</b> of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
