5|$|Five new {{characters}} in the series make their appearance in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, of which <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> Doctor Cortex's genetically enhanced superweapon Crunch Bandicoot, a bionic bandicoot created {{for the purpose of}} destroying Crash Bandicoot. Acting as Crunch's power source are the Elementals, a group of destructive masks who control the elements of Earth, Water, Fire and Air. The Elementals consist of Rok-Ko, a temperamental and rock-headed earthbending mask who controls earthquakes and landslides, Wa-Wa, a waterbending mask who controls thunderstorms and floods, Py-Ro, an easily perturbed firebending mask who controls volcano eruptions, and Lo-Lo, a joke-cracking airbending mask who controls tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|This article {{compares the}} {{properties}} of brains across {{the entire range of}} animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares {{the properties of}} other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.|$|E
5|$|Uranium has {{the highest}} number (25) of both natural and {{synthetic}} isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217–242, and three of them, 234U, 235U and 238U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> 233U, which is a final product of transformations of 232Th irradiated by slow neutrons. 233U has a much higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with 235U. Most uranium chemistry {{studies were carried out}} on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4 years.|$|E

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> outdoor learning. Program leaders {{believe that}} the {{outdoors}} environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day {{at home and in}} school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist the}} new government, since February 2000 the United Nations {{has had the}} United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (now called MONUSCO), which {{currently}} has a strength of over 16,000 peacekeepers in the country. Its principal tasks are to provide security in key areas, such as the South Kivu and North Kivu in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups {{are also in the}} Congo, as they have been {{for most of the last}} half-century. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against which Laurent Nkunda's troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army are also present.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> the {{accumulation}} of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

25|$|In later ages playwrights, historians, {{and other}} intellectuals would create works {{inspired}} by the Trojan War. The three great tragedians of Athens, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, wrote many dramas that portray episodes from the Trojan War.
