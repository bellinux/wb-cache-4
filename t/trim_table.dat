Focusing on latest-substring rules that are the order and adjacency information that model experiences a monotonically increasing precision curves. Meanwhile, the reduced rule could {{be done at the}} same time as searching. The rule discovered would be recorded in Full Table. Then rule is reduced by confidence factor and support factor and recorded in <b>Trim</b> <b>table.</b> Last procedure is pruning rules that will discard redundant and inconsistent rules then the rest will have high accuracy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in a selected fish and seafood processing line. Results showed that during 2013, 12. 4 %, 8. 3 % and 2. 3 % of fish, seafood salads and environmental swabs were positive for L. monocytogenes. All positive food samples showed a contamination level below 100 CFU/g. Environmental swabs from surface of slicing and <b>trimming</b> <b>tables,</b> slicing machines, fish filleting and trimming knives, belt glazer and working table were positive for L. monocytogenes. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to cleaning and disinfection to control the level of L. monocytogenes...|$|R

While in Kansas as early as 2006, residents have suggested the Cairn Terrier as the state dog due to the breed's appearance as Toto in the film The Wizard of Oz.

50|$|Ingram-Schipper Farm is a {{historic}} farm complex located near Boonsboro, Washington County, Maryland, United States. It is a two-story, four-bay Flemish bond brick dwelling with white <b>trim</b> and water <b>table.</b> The house features a Victorian period flat-roofed one-story porch and a slate roof. The property includes a number of early outbuildings, including a brick kitchen and wash house, three log buildings, one of which has a fireplace and {{appears to have been}} a dwelling, and a large stone barn.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trimming</b> the <b>tables</b> of {{organization}} of the armored divisions in 1943, Army Ground Forces {{cut the number of}} tank battalions in the armored division from 6 to 3 and reduced the number of tanks from 390 to 263. In process, the number of non-divisional tank battalions increased to 65, permitting more combined training with the infantry divisions. Later, it became standard practice to attach a non-divisional tank battalion to each infantry division where possible. Almost 4,000 personnel were cut from the division establishment although the number of Sherman tanks was only reduced by a quarter. While the old armored division organization was cumbersome and inefficient, the new was flexible but sometimes too lean and light, requiring supplementing. All armored divisions were converted to the new tables except the 2nd and 3rd, which remained under the old, with some modifications.|$|R

50|$|The Slate House {{is set on}} a 25 acre parcel {{north of}} the central village of Brownville. It is a two-story structure, roughly square in shape, with a low-pitch hip roof with {{bracketed}} eaves. A shed joins the main house to a carriage house at the southeast corner. A wooden <b>trim</b> water <b>table</b> separates the foundation from the first floor, and the front corners of the building have wide wooden pilasters. The west-facing front has three symmetrically-arranged bays, with paired sash windows flanking the centered entrance on the first floor, and single sash windows flanking a round-arch window above the entrance. The house has a wooden frame, which rests on a foundation composed of stacked pieces of slate. The main entrance is accessed by steps fashioned from larger pieces of slate. The front and side facades are covered with scalloped slate shingles. The attached shed and carriage house are also wood-frame structures, but are finished in board-and-batten siding. The interior of the house has retained much of its original finish.|$|R

True breeding is often as soon felt by the uncultivated as by the cultivated; and the zeal with which the strangers threw themselves into the business of the hour won the family, and placed them all in friendly relations at once. The old lady let them do what they would, admiring everything, and declaring {{over and over again that}} her new assistants [...] "beat her boys and girls to nothin' with their tastiness and smartness." [...] Sylvia <b>trimmed</b> the <b>table</b> with common flowers till it was an inviting sight before a viand appeared upon it, and hung green boughs about the room, with candles here and there to lend a festal light. Moor trundled a great cheese in from the dairy, brought milk-pans without mishap, disposed dishes, and caused Nat to cleave to him by the administration of surreptitious titbits and jocular suggestions; while Phebe tumbled about in every one's way, quite wild with excitement; and grandma stood in her pantry like a culinary general, swaying a big knife for a baton, as she issued orders and marshalled her forces, the busiest and merriest of them all.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} {{began to}} feature some pages of color photography {{in the early}} 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (1913-2003), a writer and photographer for National Geographic, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called [...] "miniature" [...] 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods. In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf <b>trim</b> and bare <b>table</b> of contents, {{to allow for a}} full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality photojournalism in the world. In 2006, National Geographic began an international photography competition with over eighteen countries participating.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 As part of {{the effort}} to {{evaluate}} TRIM (Timber Resource Inventory Model) for the next RPA National Assessment, a study was conducted using natural pine stands in North Carolina. TRIM has been used for regional timber supply studies in both the Pacific Northwest and the South (Southern Timber Supply Study). The model results are tools used for economic planning and policy making for regions in which timber is {{part of the}} economic base. <b>TRIM</b> uses yield <b>tables</b> arrayed by age class in the inventory projection calculations. The application of yield <b>tables</b> in <b>TRIM</b> can potentially alter the results of regional timber supply analysis. The objective of this study, is to investigate the TRIM growth mechanism and examine the effects of empirically derived yields on TRIM projections. In this process, different levels of data aggregation were compared and two other types of yield tables were developed and evaluated. Model projections were based on growth and inventory estimates derived from two successive Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) inventories. Simulation runs took into account "approach to normality", acreage shifts, and timber removals over the range of age classes as described by field measurements. Results were evaluated based on their comparison to FIA field measurements. In most simulations, TRIM growth and inventory projections were substantially below the growth and inventory values calculated from the Flit data. The projections varied with the yield tables used, but higher yields produced the most favorable results. For a North Carolina timber supply study, these results would indicate a sharp decline in the supply of natural pine which is the opposite of what was recorded in the field. This study suggests that empirical yield curves do not represent aggregate stand growth when stands have the characteristics found in North Carolina's natural pine...|$|R
