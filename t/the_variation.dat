5|$|Book II {{continues}} with natural meteorological events {{lower in the}} sky, including the winds, weather, whirlwinds, lightning, and rainbows. He returns to astronomical facts such as the effect of longitude on time of sunrise and sunset, <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> of the sun's elevation with latitude (affecting timetelling by sundials), and <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> of day length with latitude.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{research}} being undertaken, predictions were of a 0.5–1% effect from particulate matter; <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> from prediction {{may be explained by}} cloud formation with the particles acting as the focus for droplet creation.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC'88 Tables use {{a series}} of seven tables, {{labelled}} A to G, {{to take into account}} <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> in ingassing and outgassing rates assumed for sequential dives.|$|E
50|$|WR 1 is {{slightly}} variable {{and given the}} designation V863 Cassiopeiae. The total amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> is only 0.09 magnitudes at visual wavelengths. <b>The</b> <b>variations</b> are well-defined with a period of 16.9 days, but the light curve is not sinusoidal and its shape may vary. <b>The</b> <b>variations</b> have been ascribed to a dense asymmetric stellar wind and co-rotating interacting regions in ejected material.|$|R
25|$|Brahms's {{works in}} {{variation}} form include, among others, <b>the</b> <b>Variations</b> and Fugue on a Theme by Handel and <b>the</b> Paganini <b>Variations,</b> both for solo piano, and <b>the</b> <b>Variations</b> on a Theme by Haydn (now sometimes called <b>the</b> Saint Anthony <b>Variations)</b> in versions for two pianos and for orchestra. The final {{movement of the}} Fourth Symphony, Op.98, is formally a passacaglia.|$|R
50|$|As in <b>the</b> Goldberg <b>Variations</b> by Johann Sebastian Bach, <b>the</b> final <b>variation</b> is {{a direct}} {{restatement}} of the original theme, intended to be heard with new significance after the long journey through <b>the</b> <b>variations.</b>|$|R
5|$|The third {{variation}} {{added by}} Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived {{as one of}} the most beloved passages of Giselle. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included <b>the</b> <b>variation.</b> There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, a misconception which still persists.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>variation</b> in {{titration}} curves {{when the}} amino acids can be grouped by category. With {{the exception of}} tyrosine, using titration to distinguish among hydrophobic amino acids is problematic.|$|E
5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E

5000|$|What {{follows is}} a witty, artful set of <b>variations</b> ranging from <b>the</b> {{innocent}} first <b>variation</b> to <b>the</b> romantic third <b>variation,</b> <b>the</b> scurrying sixth <b>variation,</b> <b>the</b> boisterous, overcooked waltz in <b>the</b> seventh <b>variation</b> and <b>the</b> pathos-laden tenth <b>variation</b> which alludes to the Wagnerian opening. Dohnányi treats the piano and orchestra as equals - every instrument is given its chance to shine.|$|R
50|$|Black's move 2...e6 gives {{priority}} to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (<b>the</b> Taimanov <b>Variation),</b> 4...a6 (<b>the</b> Kan <b>Variation)</b> and 4...Nf6. After 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 (not 5.e5? Qa5+), Black can transpose to <b>the</b> Scheveningen <b>Variation</b> with 5...d6, play 5...Nc6, <b>the</b> Four Knights <b>Variation</b> or 5...Bb4, <b>the</b> Pin <b>Variation.</b>|$|R
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Alexander S. Lloyd, {{a student}} of Dickinson College, focused on the cooling rates of pillow lavas. Lloyd studied in detail <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> in crystal sizes from the edge {{pristine}} pillow lava, which could have derived from nearby Pillow Ridge which last erupted during the Pleistocene period.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} half of the period of anomalies, the peak {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> in barometric pressure and slightly corresponded with <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> in wind speed. The peak in {{the first half}} of the period was mainly observed in westerly wind conditions. On the other hand, in the second half of the period of anomalies, the peak followed <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> in wind speed but did not coincide with the decrease in barometric pressure. In this period, the wind was almost easterly–southerly.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{movement}} {{is a set}} of six variations on an andante theme in B flat major. The theme is presented primarily by the solo clarinet. <b>The</b> <b>variations</b> make use of various rhythmic motives and often feature solo instruments; for example, <b>the</b> first <b>variation</b> features <b>the</b> solo oboe. Unlike <b>the</b> other <b>variations,</b> all of which are in B flat major, <b>the</b> fourth <b>variation</b> is in B flat minor. <b>The</b> last two <b>variations</b> are in different tempos {{from the rest of the}} movement: the fifth is marked Adagio, while the sixth is marked Allegretto. <b>The</b> last <b>variation</b> is also in triple meter, in contrast with <b>the</b> other <b>variations,</b> which are in duple meter.|$|R
50|$|It is {{this second}} part that {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>variations.</b> <b>The</b> main theme (the ascending one) is {{announced by the}} piano. In is in F minor. <b>The</b> <b>variations</b> follow. Their number is debated, ranging from six to fifteen (depending on how one counts: brief variations having similar character can be analyzed as just sections of longer and more complex variations).|$|R
5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change is}} <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> in global or {{regional}} climates over time. It reflects {{changes in the}} variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes {{can be caused by}} processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{political}} conditions in what would become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous.

5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> of radio {{emissions}} from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of <b>the</b> <b>variation.</b> In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E

5|$|Musculoskeletal {{analysis}} showed significant gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle development {{was found in}} males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses of the remains. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle {{for at least some}} of the males analysed.|$|E
5|$|Mutual {{intelligibility}} {{among these}} ASL varieties is high, and <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the second}} lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are partly {{primordial}} and partly nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief primordial isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis) is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The causes of <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> of 20Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.|$|E
40|$|A general {{mathematical}} {{tool for}} expanding vector systems on a sphere into basis functions, spherical elementary current system (SECS) method, {{was applied for}} separation of <b>the</b> geomagnetic field <b>variations</b> into external and internal parts, over a limited region of central and southeastern Europe. <b>The</b> registered <b>variations</b> at three Croatian repeat stations were compared to <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> estimated by <b>the</b> SECS method using <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> from <b>the</b> different sets of observatories. The results of the SECS method were also compared to a simple assumption that <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> at repeat station are equal to those at particular observatory.

40|$|International audienceIn an oceanic waveguide, local sound speed {{variations}} induce {{acoustic path}} changes (angles, amplitudes, delays, etc [...] .). Using vertical arrays in emission and reception and double beamforming, it is possible, for each path, to jointly track {{these changes in}} term of travel-time (τ), reception angle (θr) and emission angle (θe). In order to perform ocean acoustic tomography using these observables, we build sensitivity kernels which link <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> of these observables, measured after double beamforming, to sound speed <b>variations.</b> <b>The</b> construction of these kernels is made in two steps. A first order Born approximation of the Green's function is firstly used to derive the Helmholtz equation and obtain the link between <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> of <b>the</b> sound speed distribution and <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> of <b>the</b> received signal. Then, a first order Taylor development in the (t,θr,θe) signal space leads to a linear relation between <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> of <b>the</b> received signal and <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> of <b>the</b> measured travel-time, eception angle and emission angle of each acoustic path after double beamforming. This paper establishes the mathematical expression of sensitivity kernels and results obtained with synthetic data are shown and discussed...|$|R
