40|$|Mucoadhesion is {{the binding}} of a {{material}} to a mucosal surface. The mucosal surface has {{a rate of}} absorption of up to four {{times that of the}} skin and, therefore, has great potential as a route of drug administration. Mucoadhesive polymeric drug delivery devices have been designed to allow for the slow and controlled release of a drug to a specific site, with fewer side effects and greater bioavailability in comparison to other methods of administration. In this project, mucoadhesive polymers were developed by modification through thiolation. Thiolation can increase mucoadhesive properties by up to 140 -fold through the formation of disulphide bonds between the polymer and the mucosal layer. Three different polymers were thiolated to create these mucoadhesive systems: the synthetic polymers polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyallylamine (PAAm), and the natural polymer gelatin. PAA was thiolated by reaction with L-cysteine and the crosslinker EDC. A novel method of regulating the thiol content of PAA by controlling the pH of the thiolation reaction was achieved which resulted in a range of thiolated polymers with varying degrees of thiolation. Gelatin was thiolated using a novel two-step reaction process whereby gelatin was initially aminated by reaction with EDC and ethylene diamine. This aminated gelatin was then thiolated with Traut’s reagent, creating a highly <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> product. Finally, PAAm was directly thiolated with Traut’s reagent. Neither <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> nor thiolated PAAm have been fully characterised for their mucoadhesive properties previous to this study. All thiolated polymers displayed improved cohesive and mucoadhesive properties in comparison to their unmodified counterparts. Thiol content altered the swelling ability, drug release profiles and thermal properties of the samples. The molecular weight of both PAA and gelatin were proven to have a marked impact on mucoadhesive properties. The potential toxicity of PAAm was lessened by thiolation. Thiolated polymers, both synthetic and natural, with varying degrees of thiolation, and differing swelling ability and drug release profiles were created, allowing for the design of a tailor-made mucoadhesive drug delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Endogenous enzyme {{activity}} {{can be readily}} and routinely demonstrated in ultrathin, frozen sections for electron microscopy. The procedure employed to obtain the best structural preservation as well as {{enzyme activity}} in thin sections involved fixation in glutaraldehyde, embedding in <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> or pure gelatin, partial dehydration in glycerol, and sectioning in a cryostat at - 35 °C with a slightly modified Porter-Blum microtome on which the tissue is maintained at - 70 °C and the knife at - 23 °C. Kidney cortex was used as test tissue, but a few other organs were occasionally used. Thin sections were floated {{on the surface of}} several incubation media routinely employed for enzyme cytochemistry. Positive, specific reactions were obtained for alkaline phosphatase in kidney brush border, for adenosine triphosphatase in brush border and in basal membranes of distal tubules, for acid phosphatase and esterase in lysosomes, and for NADH diaphorase in mitochondria. Mitochondrial ATPase was sporadically evident only in the distal tubule of the kidney. Localizations of enzyme activity reported by other technical approaches were confirmed and in some cases somewhat improved...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple method for obtaining ultrathin, frozen sections for electron microscopy has been developed. Tissues, cultured cells, and bacteria may be employed. They are fixed in 1. 25 – 4 % glutaraldehyde for 1 – 4 hr, are washed overnight in buffer at 3 °C, and {{are embedded in}} 20 % <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> or pure gelatin. Before sectioning they are partially dehydrated in 50 % glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen on a modified tissue holder, and subsequently maintained at - 70 °C with dry ice. Finally, they are sectioned very rapidly with glass knives on a slightly modified Porter-Blum MT- 1 microtome in a commercial deep-freeze maintained at - 35 °C and are floated in the trough of the knife on a 40 % solution of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The sections are picked up in plastic loops and transferred to distilled water {{at room temperature for}} thawing and removal of the DMSO, placed on grids coated with Formvar and carbon, air-dried, and stained with phosphotungstic acid, sodium silicotungstate, or a triple stain of osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate, and lead. Large flat sections are obtained in which ultrastructural preservation is good. They are particularly useful for cytochemical studies...|$|E
40|$|Micro-scale {{printing}} and patterning of living cells has multiple applications including tissue engineering, cell signaling assays, and the fabrication of cell-based biosensors. In this work, a molecular printing instrument, the Bioforce Nano eNabler, was modified to enable micron-scale “quill-pen” based printing of mammalian cells in a 3 D hyaluronan/gelatin based hydrogel. Specifically, photo-initiated “thiol-ene” click chemistry {{was used to}} couple the thiol groups of <b>thiolated</b> hyaluronan/thiolated <b>gelatin</b> to the alkene groups of 4 -arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) -norbornene molecules. Rapid photopolymerization enabled direct {{printing and}} controlled curing of living cells within the hydrogel matrix. The resulting hydrogels were biocompatible with human adipose-derived stem cells, NIH- 3 T 3 cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells. The utility of this printing approach was also explored for cell-based biosensors. Micro-printed cells expressing a redox sensitive variant of the green fluorescent protein (roGFP-R 12) showed a measurable fluorescent response to addition of oxidizing and then reducing agents. This work represents a novel approach to micron-scale cell patterning, and its potential for living, cell-based biosensors...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} use {{of natural}} ECM components and synthetic materials offers an attractive alternative to fabricate hydrogel-based tissue engineering scaffolds to study cell-matrix interactions in three-dimensions (3 D). A facile method was developed to modify gelatin with cysteine via a bifunctional PEG linker, thus introducing free thiol groups to gelatin chains. A covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogel was fabricated using <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGdA) via thiol-ene reaction. Unmodified gelatin was physically incorporated in a PEGdA-only matrix for comparison. We sought to understand the effect of crosslinking modality on hydrogel physicochemical properties and the impact on 3 D cell entrapment. Compared to physically incorporated gelatin hydrogels, covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogels displayed higher maximum weight swelling ratio (Q max), higher water content, significantly lower cumulative gelatin dissolution up to 7 days, and lower gel stiffness. Furthermore, fibroblasts encapsulated within covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogels showed extensive cytoplasmic spreading {{and the formation of}} cellular networks over 28 days. In contrast, fibroblasts encapsulated in the physically incorporated gelatin hydrogels remained spheroidal. Hence, crosslinking ECM protein with synthetic matrix creates a stable scaffold with tunable mechanical properties and with long-term cell anchorage points, thus supporting cell attachment and growth in the 3 D environment. © 2011.

40|$|Chemically {{modified}} {{hyaluronic acid}} (HA) –gelatin hydrogels {{have been documented}} to support attach-ment, growth, and proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro and to facilitate repair and engineering of tissues in vivo. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the optimal composition of a synthetic extracellular matrix (sECM) that would promote wound repair and induce tissue regeneration in a rabbit vocal fold wound healing model. The sECM was formed using a thiol-modified semisynthetic glycosaminoglycan (GAG) derived of HA (Carbylan-SX) mixed with a <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> derivative, co-cross-linked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate to form Carbylan-GSX. Forty rabbits underwent vocal fold biopsy bi-laterally. Rabbits were treated with Carbylan-SX, which lacks gelatin, or with Carbylan-GSX with different gelatin concentrations (2. 5 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 20 %) via unilateral injection of the vocal fold at the time of biopsy. Saline was injected in the contralateral vocal fold as a control. Three weeks after biopsy and injection, animals were euthanized and mRNA levels of procollagen type 1, fibronectin, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b 1), fibromodulin, HA synthase 2, hyaluronidase 2, and tissue biomechanics were evaluated. Hyaluronidase mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated in for Carbylan-GSX 20 % w/w gelatin compared to controls. Both Carbylan-SX and Carbylan-GSX significantly improved tissue elasticity and viscosity. Carbylan-GSX containing 5 % w/w gelatin showed the most promise as a scaffold material for vocal fold tissue regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Recently we {{reported}} that direct injection of M 1 macrophages significantly caused tumor regression in vivo. Despite the promising result, a major limitation in translating {{this approach is}} the induction of acute inflammatory response. To improve the strategy, a biocompatible scaffold for cell presentation and support is essential to control cell fate. Here, we aimed to elucidate the anti-tumor effects of a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGdA) and <b>thiolated</b> <b>gelatin</b> poly (ethylene glycol) (Gel-PEG-Cys) cross-linked hydrogels capsulated with M 1 macrophages. Methods: Hydrogels were made at 0. 5 % (w/v) Iragcure 2959 photoinitiator, 10 % (w/v) PEGdA, and 10 % (w/v) Gel-PEG-Cys. Monocytic THP- 1 cells were loaded into hydrogels and differentiated into M 1 macrophages with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma. A nude mice ectopic liver cancer model with dorsal window chamber (DWC) and a subcutaneous tumor model were both performed to validate the in vivo application of M 1 hydrogels. Results: M 1 hydrogels significantly decreased the viability of HCC cells (MHCC 97 L: - 46 %; Hep 3 B: - 56. 9 %; P< 0. 05) compared to the control in vitro. In response HCC cells, the hydrogel embedded M 1 macrophages up-regulated nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha activating caspase- 3 induced apoptosis in the tumor cells. Increased tumor necrosis was observed in DWC filled with M 1 hydrogels. In addition, mice treated with M 1 hydrogels exhibited a significant 2. 4 -fold decrease in signal intensity of subcutaneous HCC tumor compared to control (P= 0. 036). Conclusion: M 1 hydrogels induced apoptosis in HCC cells and tumor regression in vivo. Continuous development of the scaffold-based cancer immunotherapy may provide an alternative and innovative strategy against HCC...|$|E
