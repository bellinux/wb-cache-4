5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> {{validity}} at all, {{may represent}} the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that}} it is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E

If the debt is instead to another player, all the assets are instead given to that opponent, but the new owner must still pay the bank to un-mortgage any such properties received.

500|$|Wagner's operas do {{not reveal}} where the Rhinemaidens came from, or whether <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> {{connection}} to other characters. Whereas {{most of the}} characters in the cycle are inter-related, through birth, marriage, or sometimes both, the Rhinemaidens are seemingly independent. The identity of their father who entrusted them with the guardianship of the gold is not given in the text. Some Wagnerean scholars have suggested that he may be a [...] "Supreme Being" [...] who is the father of Wotan and all the gods—indeed, of all creation. Others take the German Rheintöchter literally and say that they are the daughters of the Rhine River. Whatever is surmised, the Rhinemaidens are in a different category from Wotan and the other gods, who are destroyed by fire at the end of Götterdämmerung, while the Rhinemaidens swim happily away in the river, bearing their recovered treasure.|$|E
500|$|A female often forms a {{long-lasting}} social {{relationship with}} a male in her troop, known as a [...] "friendship". These nonsexual affiliative friendships benefit both the male and female. Males benefit from these relationships because they are usually formed soon after he immigrates into a new group, and helps the male integrate into the group more easily. He could also potentially end up mating with his female friend in the future. Females gain protection from threats to themselves and their infants (if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any).</b> Males occasionally [...] "baby-sit" [...] for their female friends, so she can feed and forage freely without the burden of having to carry or watch the infant. Sexually receptive females and newly immigrated males can form such friendships. These relationships are sometimes enduring and the pair grooms and remains close to each other. They also travel, forage, sleep, and raise infants together, as well as fight together against aggressive conspecifics.|$|E

500|$|Wired said Kaspersky's critics {{accuse him}} of using the company to spy on users for Russian intelligence. Russian {{telecommunications}} companies for example are required by federal law in Russia {{to cooperate with the}} government's military and spy operations if asked. Kaspersky said his company has never been asked to tamper with its software for espionage and called the accusations [...] "cold war paranoia." [...] According to Wired, Kaspersky staffers argue [...] "not unconvincingly" [...] that spying on users would hurt its business and its relationship with the Russian FSB, the KGB's successor, is limited. According to Gartner, [...] "There's no evidence that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> back doors in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state... but there is still a concern that you can’t operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.” Computing mocked some of the more extreme accusations of espionage, but said it would be unlikely for a Russian business to grow to the size of Kaspersky Lab without relationships within the Russian government. NPR journalists also said it was unlikely Kaspersky was using its software for espionage, because it would be risky for the company's business, but said Kaspersky showed an unusual disinterest in Russia-based cybercrime.|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed.

We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

500|$|In the mid-16th {{century the}} Rhondda, {{at that time}} known as the Vale of Rotheney, belonged to the large but sparsely {{inhabited}} parish of Ystradyfodwg, 'St. Tyfodwg's Vale'. For administrative purposes the parish was divided into three hamlets: the Upper or Rhigos Hamlet to the north, the Middle or Penrhys Hamlet and the lower or Clydach Hamlet. Throughout the post-Medieval period the Rhondda was a heavily wooded area and its main economic staple was the rearing of sheep, horses and cattle. The historian Rice Merrick, in describing the upland area of the Vale of Glamorgan, stated that there [...] "was always great breeding of cattle, horses and sheep; but in elder time therin grew but small store of corn, for in most places there the ground was not thereunto apt..." [...] While English cartographer John Speed described that the rearing of cattle was the [...] "best means unto wealth that the Shire doth afford". As there was no fair held in the Rhondda the animals would be taken to neighbouring fairs and markets at Neath, Merthyr, Llantrisant, Ynysybwl and Llandaff. However, to be self-supporting, the farmers of the area grew crops such as oats, corn and barley in small quantities. Crops were grown in {{the lower part of}} the Rhondda on narrow meadows adjoining the riversides, though during the Napoleonic Wars scarce supplies forced the cultivation of the upland areas such as Carn-y-wiwer and Penrhys. Merrick would describe the diet of the upland inhabitants as consisting of [...] "bread made of wheat...and ale and bear" [...] and over two hundred years later Benjamin Malkin showed how little the diet had changed when he wrote that the people still ate [...] "Oatmeal bread, with a relish of miserable cheese; and the beer, where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any,</b> is worse than none".|$|E
