5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> a language controls <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E

5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range.

TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E

5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. <b>The</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E

30|$|To {{disprove}} {{the null}} hypothesis we create a linear model. The model aims at explaining a shop’s retention rate at increasing distances. Then, we characterize the shop’s size using three different measures. The first measure is the total volume of its sales, i.e. {{the number of items}} that have been purchased in the shop. A larger shop generates high volumes of sales. The second measure is the shop’s variety or assortment, i.e. the number of different products that can be purchased in the shop. Larger shops have a larger assortment of products. The last measure is <b>the</b> shop’s <b>sophistication.</b> <b>The</b> shop’s <b>sophistication</b> can be viewed as <b>the</b> average <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products sold at the shop, {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> country <b>sophistication</b> is <b>the</b> average <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products it exports [7].|$|R

25|$|On 20 January 2007, a {{group of}} gunmen {{attacked}} the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala, captured four American soldiers, and subsequently killed them. The attackers passed through an Iraqi checkpoint at around 5pm, {{a total of five}} black GMC Suburbans, similar to those driven by U.S. security and diplomatic officials. They were also wearing American military uniforms and spoke fluent English. Because of <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> the attack, some analysts have suggested that only a group like the Quds Force would be able to plan and carry out such an action. Former CIA officer Robert Baer also suggested that the five Americans were killed by the Quds Force in revenge for the Americans holding five Iranians since the January 11 raid in Irbil.
