5|$|The viscous {{nature of}} airflow reduces the local {{velocities}} on a surface and {{is responsible for}} skin friction. <b>The</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer.

5|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, {{the pressure and}} temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E

5|$|On {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple sap as {{a source}} of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E
5|$|The gastrotrichs (phylum Gastrotricha), {{commonly}} referred to as hairybacks, are a group of microscopic (0.06-3.0mm), worm-like, pseudocoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly eight hundred species of gastrotrich have been described.|$|E

5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in {{a thin layer of}} clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a —a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an , in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out {{in contrast to the}} underlying flesh. <b>The</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the cap as a film.
