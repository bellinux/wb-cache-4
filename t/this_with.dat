5|$|After these performances, Karthik was {{recalled}} to the Ranji Trophy team at {{the start}} of the 200304 season. This time, he accumulated 438 runs with an average of 43.80, with two centuries, and took twenty catches. After opening the batting for much of the round-robin phase, and struggling with only 159 runs at 19.87 in four matches, Karthik then played in the zonal Under-19 one-dayers, managing only 28 runs in four innings. Karthik returned to the middle-order for the semi-final against Railways, scoring his maiden first-class century of 122 to help his team take a first innings lead. He followed <b>this</b> <b>with</b> 48 in the second innings, to help Tamil Nadu progress to the final on the basis of the first innings after Railways held on for a draw still more than 300 runs short of their target. He followed <b>this</b> <b>with</b> an unbeaten 109 in the final against Mumbai. His innings was the mainstay of Tamil Nadu’s 294, but Mumbai made 613 to take a first innings lead. Tamil Nadu made 4/393 in the second innings with Karthik not batting, but the first innings lead in the drawn match gave Mumbai the title. Karthik ended with three catches in the innings. However these performances were insufficient to gain regional representation, and he was overlooked for South Zone's matches in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E

He followed <b>this</b> <b>with</b> three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E

5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation.

In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on <b>this</b> <b>with</b> a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E

5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to <b>this</b> <b>with</b> a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E
