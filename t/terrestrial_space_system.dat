It is well established that in flows approaching the microscale (Dh 100 kg-m- 2 -s- 1). Fluid visualization results from these studies {{have been used to}} develop many of the flow regime maps currently available for estimating heat transfer and pressure drop. Review of these flow maps shows that at microscale channel diameters and low mass fluxes, common flow regime predictions begin to break down. In the current research, two-phase flow regime data is obtained via high-speed visualization of condensing flows of R- 134 a at mass fluxes from 80 to 150 kg-m- 2 -s- 1 in square microchannels (Dh = 840 μm) at quality ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 60.

40|$|Abstract: Studies on {{two-phase}} flows {{have been}} performed at the Institut de M&anique des Fluides de Toulouse {{for the past ten}} years, to improve the knowledge of the two-phase gas-liquid flows in nonnal and microgravity conditions, in order to optimize the design of the <b>terrestrial</b> and <b>space</b> thennohydraulic <b>systems</b> (evaporators, condensers, heat exchangers [...] .). The preceding studies were mainly focused on bubble coalescence, break-up and dispersion in turbulent flows. The specific role of the turbulence has been isolated through microgravity experiments in which the bubble slip velocity vanishes. Interesting results were obtained highlighting a spectacular rate of coalescence in microgravity and also the role of the eigen dynamics of the bubbles in their deformation and rupture. We now propose to study the action of a mean velocity field on the various physical mechanisms that control the bubble size in a flow: their growth and detachment at a wall, their deformation and rupture and their coalescence. Experiments will be carried out in a Couette flow between 2 coaxial rotating cylinders, in a first step on ground with two neutrally buoyant liquids and in a second step in microgravity, with bubbles. 1...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} half of the twentieth century, {{significant}} advances have been made in developing an understanding of phase change heat transfer (e. g., boiling and condensation). Further advances in phase change heat transfer will continue to take place motivated by new technologies such as microelectronics, thermal management in <b>space,</b> advanced <b>terrestrial</b> and <b>space</b> power <b>systems</b> and processing of designed materials. In the past, because of the complexity of the processes, very often we have “oversimplified”, maybe out of necessity, the modeling of the processes. The resulting weaknesses in our models and correlations have continued to haunt us whenever we have encountered new applications. In order to address the phenomena from basic principles, in my opinion, we need to pay attention to processes occurring at nano to micro to macro scales, capitalizing on recent advances that have been made in experimental and numerical techniques. These phenomena include nucleation, evolution, merger and breakup of vaporliquid interfaces, contact line behavior; coupling of the bulk and surface features of the solid; and the role of nano and micro inhomogeneties and intermolecular forces between solid and liquid. Prediction of nucleate boiling transfer is taken as an example to demonstrate the value of coupling different scales in meeting the overall objective...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} considers experiential {{knowledge as}} a basis for distinguishing conceptual models of atmospheric space from those of <b>terrestrial</b> geographic <b>space.</b> Models of spatial knowledge typically define knowledge acquisition in terms of a static environmental framework, a framework that accurately represents the manner in which individuals experience <b>terrestrial</b> <b>space.</b> However, this framework does not adequately account for experiential knowledge of the atmosphere. Weather phenomena are typically defined by both spatial and temporal attributes. The current investigation considers this distinction {{as a basis}} for exploring conceptual models of large-scale atmospheric phenomena. A variety of classifications have been set forth in the cognitive literature to characterize experiential knowledge of large-scale geographic domains (Tversky et al., 1999; Montello, 1993; Zubin, 1989). For instance, consider the distinction between small and large-scale space (Ittelson, 1973), perceptual and transperceptual knowledge (Downs and Stea, 1977), primary and secondary knowledge acquisition (Presson and Hazelrigg, 1984), and the like, as relevant examples.
