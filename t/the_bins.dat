5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. <b>The</b> <b>bins</b> should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E

Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of <b>the</b> <b>bins,</b> but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they heard so much about whilst growing up.|$|E

5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among <b>the</b> <b>bins.</b> Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{solid waste}} bin {{detection}} and waste level classification {{system that is}} rotation invariant is presented. First, possible locations and orientations of <b>the</b> <b>bin</b> are detected using Hough line detection. Then cross correlation is calculated to differentiate <b>the</b> true <b>bin</b> position and orientation from those of other similar objects. Next, features are extracted {{from the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>bin</b> area and together with detected bin corners they are used to determine the bin's waste level. A few features are also obtained from the outside of <b>the</b> <b>bin</b> area to check whether there is rubbish littered outside <b>the</b> <b>bin.</b> <b>The</b> proposed system was tested on shifted, rotated and unrotated bin images containing different level of waste. In <b>the</b> experiment, <b>bin</b> detection was treated separately from waste level classification. For bin detection, if 95 of the opening area is captured then <b>the</b> <b>bin</b> is considered detected correctly. The waste level classification is only considered for <b>the</b> correctly detected <b>bins</b> where <b>the</b> waste level is classified as empty, partially full or full. The system also checks the presence of rubbish outside <b>the</b> <b>bin.</b> In training, only images containing unrotated bin were used while in testing images containing both unrotated and rotated bin were used in equal number. The system achieves an average bin detection rate of 97. 5 and waste level classification rate of 99. 4 despite variations in the bin's location, rotation and content. It is also robust against occlusion of <b>the</b> <b>bin</b> opening by large objects and confusion from square objects littered outside <b>the</b> <b>bin.</b> Its low average execution time suggests that the proposed method is suitable for real-time implementation.
