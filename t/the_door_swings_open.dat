The survivors carry the hijacker inside and dress his wound. Tokiyasu then uses the rifle to force everyone out of the plane and locks himself safely inside, with the hijacker. Right after, Tokiyasu's screams are heard and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open.</b> Everyone rushes inside to find Tokiyasu dead, drained of all blood. The hijacker appears and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. At sunrise, Noriko is seen standing on a ridge. She speaks, but with the voice of the alien, the Gokemidoro. It is revealed that the Gokemidoro has invaded the earth, intending to eradicate the human race. Noriko then plunges off the ridge, shriveling into a cadaver.|$|E
50|$|Some time later, Negan is bathing {{and having}} his hair cut by Olivia outside his cell door. After finishing, Negan {{walks back to}} his cell at gunpoint from Andrea, who calls him a 'fucking monster,' much to Negan's amusement.

However, it turns out Olivia didn't lock Negan's cell properly as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open,</b> which Negan notices. However, Negan decides not to escape and remains in his cell with the door open until Rick comes downstairs, then taunts him about the numerous ways he could have destroyed Alexandria without anyone realizing, but claimed to stay as sign of good faith and an offering to amend their trust. As Rick locks up the cage and leaves, Negan taunts him again by stating the only reason he's alive is so Rick can prove to himself that he's still a good person, and that he wants everyone else to believe {{he is the only}} one who can fix the world.|$|E
50|$|A trio {{of young}} people sort through old {{belongings}} in a shack, in a similar style to the one featured in The Evil Dead, at night. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open,</b> and they find a box containing the 'Would You Love a Monsterman?' doll and a tape, which starts to play when they plug it in. The male is throttled by an invisible force, (which is actually band member Kalma, complete with top hat, when seen through the super 8 film camera he drops). One of the females is also dragged into the closet to her doom, by the guitarist, Amen. The band then appears, and, magically chaining the second female to a rocking chair, continue to sing the song. Her friends appear again, as zombies (with the female mirroring the deadite Linda from The Evil Dead), later in the song. The band continues until the cassette player is unplugged by the second female's struggling foot. The band and zombies disappear. As she looks around, relieved, Mr. Lordi attacks her from behind (seen {{through the lens of}} the camera) just as the camera runs out of film.|$|E

50|$|That evening, Mrs Harter again hears {{a message}} through the radio from Patrick, {{telling her that}} will be coming for her at half-past nine on Friday night. She writes a note {{detailing}} what she has heard as proof, should she die at that time, {{that it is possible}} to receive messages from the afterlife. She gives this to Elizabeth to pass on to the doctor in the event of her death. On the Friday night in question, she sits in her room with the radio switched on and the will in her hand as she peruses its contents, having had fifty pounds in cash withdrawn from the bank to supplement the amount bequeathed to Elizabeth. She hears the noise of a step outside her room and staggers to her feet, dropping something from her fingers as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> and she sees her dead husband's bewhiskered figure standing before her. She collapses and is found an hour later by Elizabeth. Two days later the maid passes the note to the doctor, who dismisses it all as hallucinations. Charles agrees, not wanting to spoil things now that his plan appears to be reaching fruition. Having safely disconnected the wire from the radio set to his bedroom, and burnt the false whiskers he wore on the night of his aunt's death, he looks forward to the reading of the will and inheriting his aunt's money - a sum desperately needed to stave off possible imprisonment as a result of his business misdeeds.|$|E
50|$|One summer afternoon, Shawn {{goes for}} a drive with his parents and dog, Ace, but the family car suffers a flat tire {{in front of an}} {{abandoned}} mansion.

As Shawn tentatively approaches the dilapidated structure, <b>the</b> entrance <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open,</b> and he's drawn into a magical vortex. Reunited with Ace, Shawn must travel {{into the heart of the}} Deep Labyrinth to rescue his parents.|$|R

50|$|On {{machines}} with manually swung doors, one trivial yet important detail is a door stop to prevent banging when opening.

50|$|The two-story brick home {{is in the}} Flemish bond {{pattern and}} has endured more than 200 years.

60|$|The empty {{carriage}} {{is close}} to the curb-stone, with <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swinging</b> <b>open</b> as if to urge the owners to hurry and take possession. The high-stepping trotters are covered with blankets to protect them from the piercing cold, and, with their heads drooping, are either asleep or wondering why they are not put into the stable to take their night's rest; and the coachman is dancing about on the pavement to keep his feet warm--not by any means a merry kind of dance, although he moves about pretty briskly. He has taken off his gloves, for they seem to make his hands colder, and now he has thrust one hand into his pocket and is blowing on the other with all his might. His whip, that curled so defiantly in the air, is now pushed under his arm, and the lash is trailing, limp and draggled, on the stones. He is warmly clad, and his great-coat has three capes, but all cannot put sufficient heat into his body, for it is a bitter cold night, and the wind comes howling down the street as if it would like to bite off everybody's ears and noses. It shakes the leafless branches of the trees until they all seem to be moaning and groaning together. The moon is just rising over the church, and the coachman is standing right in a broad patch of its light. But moonlight, though very beautiful when you are where you can comfortably admire it, never warmed anybody yet. And so the poor coachman gets no good out of that.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I became {{intensely}} {{alive to}} the whole situation.

He was burly, venerable, a little indignant, and full of thanks. Behind him his two girls, in short-skirted costumes, white stockings, and low shoes, their heads powdered and earrings sparkling in their ears, huddled together behind their father, wrapped up in their light mantles. One had kept her little black mask on her face, the other held hers in her hand.|$|R
60|$|Gerald had {{supper at}} his hotel, and {{afterward}} found the time hang upon his hands. The general lounge was badly lighted, and its uncovered floor was smeared with gumbo mud from the boots {{of the wet}} men who slouched in to <b>the</b> bar. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> kept <b>swinging</b> <b>open,</b> letting in cold draughts; and Gerald could find nobody to talk to. He had not {{enough money to pay}} off his debt, but thought he had sufficient to enable him to make some compromise with his creditor, and so had determined to see what could be done. It was, however, impossible to spend the dismal evening at the hotel, and he knew where excitement might be found at a moderate cost--that is, if one were cautious and lucky.|$|R
50|$|The film {{ends with}} Ava {{rebuilding}} {{her life and}} working with Tony in the facility office. Before leaving for the day he assures her that the demon {{would not be able}} to return, as she is stronger. However she soon begins to sense that the demon is near and accidentally causes some boxes to fall, revealing some old files on former possessed people. She discovers that her mother had also previously been possessed by the same demon, hinting that their bloodline is predisposed to possessions. Ava then recalls finding a tattoo similar to the one she received during the ritual, making her realize that her sister had deliberately sent the demon into her in order to avoid getting possessed herself. Furious, Ava begins screaming and <b>the</b> office <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open,</b> showing <b>the</b> shadow of Ava's demon.|$|R
60|$|They leaned {{a little}} forward. <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> <b>doors</b> were <b>opened.</b> A girl's musical laugh rang {{out from the}} corridor. Tall and elegant, with her black lace skirt {{trailing}} upon the floor, her left hand resting upon {{the shoulder of the}} man into whose ear she was whispering, and whom she led straight to one of the writing tables, Miss Violet Brown swept into the room. On her right, and nearest to the two men, was Mr. Vincent Cawdor.|$|R
50|$|With {{all but one}} ticket {{gone and}} no {{money to buy a}} bar, Charlie is desolate. His parents sing about how they wish they could raise their son {{together}} and about how they hope for a better life ("If Your Mother Were Here"). Winter comes, and one day Charlie finds some money dropped by a rich couple. Encouraged by the mysterious tramp, he buys a Wonka Bar, and finds a Golden Ticket inside that prompts Grandpa Joe {{to get out of bed}} and walk for the first time in forty years ("Don't Ya Pinch Me, Charlie"). On the day they are to enter the factory, Charlie and Grandpa Joe feel out of place amidst all the hoopla on the red carpet. Finally, the moment of truth arrives. With a choral fanfare, <b>the</b> factory <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> and all eyes to turn to see the mysterious Willy Wonka, invites the Golden Ticket winners into his factory to see all the wonders ("It Must Be Believed to Be Seen").|$|R
6000|$|The young girl, so fresh, so unconventional, {{and yet so}} {{orderly and}} obedient to common rules, as you at once {{recognized}} her to be, was widely in contrast, at that moment, with everything about her. The sordid and ugly luxuriance of gigantic weeds that grew in {{the angle of the}} house, and the heavy projection that overshadowed her, and the time-worn framework of the door,--none of these things belonged to her sphere. But, even as a ray of sunshine, fall into what dismal place it may, instantaneously creates for itself a propriety in being there, so did it seem altogether fit that the girl should be standing at the threshold. It was no less evidently proper that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> should <b>swing</b> <b>open</b> to admit her. [...] The maiden lady herself, sternly inhospitable in her first purposes, soon began to feel that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> ought to be shoved back, and the rusty key be turned in the reluctant lock.|$|R
5000|$|They hear Alice {{scream and}} find {{her in the}} bathroom. Alice tells them the man was chasing them {{and they need to}} hide.

Jane tells him that they won't let her leave and backs away from <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> It <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> for Alan to leave but not Jane. Jane wanders the house and sings Lavender Blue. She chases Suzie to her room. The music box begins playing and Jane opens it with the tiny key from the barn. Inside is {{the other half of the}} torn photo, {{revealing}} Liam to be Jane's father. Suzie tells Jane to hide because [...] "he's coming." [...] Jane flees and tells Liam to stay away. Liam tells her that he isn't the monster, Patrick is.

500|$|The Matterhorn is a {{subwoofer}} model {{completed in}} March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville, Georgia after a U.S. military {{request for a}} loudspeaker that could project infrasonic waves over a distance. The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20Hz, and generate 94dB {{at a distance of}} , and more than 140dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth. It can generate a constant 15Hz sine wave tone at 140dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion.

[...] Tom and Lisa {{disembark}} from the plane fighting, which amuses John. More is told about Tom and John, and the planning of the hunt wedding is begun. They finally find a reverend that will marry the two non-Catholics, Reverend Hicks, a Unitarian. The minister finds that the couple fights a lot, and they go {{to meet with him}} about it and fight the whole time. He says it is not a marriage but a [...] "rematch," [...] and the narrator convinces him to marry the two anyway. John falls off a horse while interviewing actors for the film and is considerably injured. On hunter's wife is heard to have died from falling off her horse, which causes the wedding to be delayed and considerably affects Tom. John arrives back in Ireland on crutches. He tells of his fall and goes home to Ricki, who finally finds out about his injuries. Tom, Lisa, John, and the narrator go out to dinner, where John tells Tom and Lisa that the screaming of the chef in the kitchen while <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swing</b> <b>open</b> sounds like Tom their fighting, which surprises them. Mike and the narrator go to pick up the minister, and Mike talks about Ireland during the trip. The day of the hunt wedding follows, and Lisa has a bad cold. The minister, after waiting for Ricki to get a Bible, enters a long sermon about sin. The cake is served and found to be rock hard after the week of delay. Tom then asks the minister about the legitimacy of the marriage, who then pronounces them man and wife. Tom rides off to the hunt, but John is detained by his injuries. Lisa then asks the minister about the legality of the marriage, and he gives her papers to sign. The narrator awakes back at his hotel and Ricki calls. She tells him of the proceedings after the wedding, and Tom is nowhere to be found.|$|R
