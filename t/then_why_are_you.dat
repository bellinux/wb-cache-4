6000|$|My dear Reynolds--Ever since I {{wrote to}} my Brothers from Southampton I {{have been in}} a taking--and at this moment I am about to become settled--for I have {{unpacked}} my books, put them into a snug corner, pinned up Haydon, Mary Queen of Scots, and Milton with his daughters in a row. In the passage I found a head of Shakspeare which I had not before seen. It is most likely the same that George spoke so well of, for I like it extremely. Well--this head I have hung over my Books, just above the three in a row, having first discarded a French Ambassador--now this alone is a good morning's work. Yesterday I went to Shanklin, which occasioned a great debate in my mind whether I should live there or at Carisbrooke. Shanklin is a most beautiful place--Sloping wood and meadow ground reach round the Chine, which is a cleft between the Cliffs of the depth of nearly 300 feet at least. This cleft is filled with trees and bushes in the narrow part, and as it widens becomes bare, {{if it were not for}} primroses on one side, which spread to the very verge of the Sea, and some fishermen's huts on the other, perched midway in the Balustrades of beautiful green Hedges along their steps down to the sands. But the sea, Jack, the sea--the little waterfall--then the white cliff--then St. Catherine's Hill--"the sheep in the meadows, the cows in the corn." [...] <b>Then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> at Carisbrooke? say you. Because, in the first place, I should be at twice the Expense, and three times the inconvenience--next that from here I can see your continent--from a little hill close by the whole north Angle of the Isle of Wight, with the water between us. In the 3rd place, I see Carisbrooke Castle from my window, and have found several delightful wood-alleys, and copses, and quick freshes.[12] As for primroses--the Island ought to be called Primrose Island--that is, if the nation of Cowslips agree thereto, of which there are divers Clans just beginning to lift up their heads. Another reason of my fixing is, that I am more in reach of the places around me. I intend to walk over the Island east--West--North--South. I have not seen many specimens of Ruins--I don't think however I shall ever see one to surpass Carisbrooke Castle. The trench is overgrown with the smoothest turf, and the Walls with ivy. The Keep within side is one Bower of ivy--a colony of Jackdaws have been there for many years. I dare say I have seen many a descendant of some old cawer who peeped through the Bars at Charles the first, when he was there in Confinement. On the road from Cowes to Newport I saw some extensive Barracks, which disgusted me extremely with the Government for placing such a Nest of Debauchery in so beautiful a place. I asked a man on the Coach about this--and he said that the people had been spoiled. In the room where I slept at Newport, I found this on the Window--"O Isle spoilt by the milatary!..." ...|$|E

They used heretofore to lodge with their Prince in the Castle, when Incredulity was the Lord Mayor of this town; but since my coming hither, they lie more in the outsides and walls, and have made themselves dens, and caves, and holes, and strongholds therein. Wherefore, O Mansoul! thy work, as to this, will be so much the more difficult and hard; that is, to take, mortify, and put them to death according to the will of my Father. Nor can you utterly rid yourselves of them, unless you should pull down the walls of your town, the which I am by no means willing you should. Do you ask me, What shall we do <b>then?</b> <b>Why,</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> diligent, and quit you like men; observe their holes; find out their haunts; assault them, and make no peace with them.
