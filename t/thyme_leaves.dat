40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} to study {{the changes in the}} content and composition of chlorophylls and carotenoids in ground <b>thyme</b> <b>leaves</b> as a function of supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane extraction. the results indicated that the maximum oleoresin yield could be obtained with supercritical carbon dioxide at 400 bar and 35 or 55 °C and sub-critical propane at 50 bar. Pigment solvating capacity of supercritical carbon dioxide increased with the increase of extraction pressure. Substantial variation was noticed in pigment composition between raw material, oleoresin and residues (powders after extraction). Chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a and the Mg-free derivatives were the dominant pigments in the raw material with other derivatives being minor constituents. After extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide at 35 °C and pressures higher than 200 bar, epimerisation and oxidation of chlorophylls lead to marked accumulation of artefacts in the residues. The content of oxidized chlorophylls was increased proportionally to the increase of the extraction pressure. The brownish green coloured-oleoresins contained only pheophytins indicating that rapid substitution of Mg with hydrogen atoms on the molecules takes place during extraction of such pigment by supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane. The marked conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytins was found in oleoresin extracted by supercritical fluid extraction at 55 °C and 100 bar...|$|E

The interactive effects of foliar application of chitosan and drought stress on dry matter, essential oil yield, and selected physiological characteristics including photosynthetic pigments, osmotic adjustment, and lipid peroxidation of Thymus were investigated in a two-year study from 2014 to 2015. Treatments consisted of 0, 200, and 400  μL L− 1 chitosan applied to plants grown under field capacity, mild drought stress (50 % field capacity), and severe drought stress (25 % field capacity). Dry matter yield decreased substantially as drought stress intensified. However, essential oil content increased under stress conditions, with the highest essential oil yield obtained from plants under mild drought stress. Foliar application of chitosan compensated to some extent for dry matter and oil yield reduction of plants grown under drought stress. The highest essential oil yield (1. 52  g plant− 1) was obtained by application of 400  μL L− 1 chitosan under the mild stress condition in 2015 when plants were mature. The compensatory effect of chitosan in reducing the negative impact of stress conditions on dry matter and oil yield was due mainly to stimulation of osmotic adjustment through proline accumulation and reduction of lipid peroxidase level, which increased the integrity of cell membranes of <b>thyme</b> <b>leaves...</b>|$|E

40|$|The European {{ban on the}} non-therapeutic use of {{antibiotic}} growth promoters and limits {{on the use of}} other drugs have increased digestive disorders and mortality in growing rabbits. In addition, consumers demand natural products, and therefore synthetic active compounds should be replaced by natural ones.

Plants (whole plants, leaves or seeds, mainly used as feedstuffs) and their extracts (considered as additives) are being increasingly used in animal nutrition as appetisers, digestive and physiological stimulants, colorants, and antioxidants, and for the prevention and treatment of certain pathological conditions. The digestive effects of herbs and spices have been tested primarily in humans and laboratory animals, and few trials have been performed on farm animals. Studies on the dietary inclusion of herbs and spices or their extracts in rabbit meat production are quite scarce, and the overall benefit remains unclear due to discrepancies in results, {{such as the use of}} plant preparations as galactagogues in rabbit does.

In this study the osteogenic effects of Saffron extract and biogenic synthesis gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using Shirazi <b>Thyme</b> (Zataria multiflora) <b>leaves</b> was investigated on differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Methods: In this experimental study, Wistar rat bone marrow cells were collected and identified. Then these cells were detected by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity of GNPs and Saffron extract was measured by MTT assay (3 - 4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide). Samples were divided to 3 experimental groups and were treated with GNPs (20 µg/ml), Saffron extract (400 µg/ml), and a combination of Saffron extract and GNPs (400 and 20 µg/ml respectively). Differentiation effects were investigated by alizarin red staining after 21 days and alkaline phosphates (ALP) activity after 14 days. Results: Flow cytometry analysis of surface specific markers confirmed the presence of stem cells. According to the results from MTT assay the concentrations that used for synergic groups had not affected cell viability (p= 0. 6).

Maternal line rabbits (n= 294) of both sexes were used. S and T were supplemented to isonitrogenous and isoenergy diets formulated to cover the requirements of meat producing rabbits. All diets did not include coccidiostatic. Rabbits received the S and T supplementation separately or combined (TS), during the whole growing-fattening period (5 th- 11 th week of age: S-S; T-T; ST-ST) or only during fattening (8 th- 11 th week of age: C-S; C-T; C-ST). On overall 7 groups of animals of 36 rabbits each were used for carcass evaluation: Control (C-C; not supplemented diet) C-S, S-S, C-T, T-T, C-ST, ST-ST. Rabbits were slaughtered at 77 days of age. Carcasses were dissected and carcass yield, carcass fatness and meatiness were determined and pHu and L*a*b* colour were measured on Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. On 15 rabbits per dietary treatment the LD muscle was dissected and frozen for WHC, proximate composition, cholesterol, heme iron and vitamin B 12 analyses on raw meat and for proximate composition and cholesterol content on cooked meat. Carcass traits were not affected by the dietary treatments, with exception of the incidence of the scapular fat that showed its lowest value in C-T group (0. 39 %) and its highest value in S-S (0. 56 %; P< 0. 05). Spirulina and Thyme supplementations didn’t affect the rheological traits as well, even though a tendency towards a lower total water loss was found in S-S and C-S groups (33. 1 and 33. 4 %, respectively; n. s.) compared to the other groups (35. 2 ± 0. 86 %). Consequently, cooked LD meat of S-S group contained more water (67 %) than the other groups (66. 1 ± 0. 27 %; n. s.). S-S and T-T diets reduced the protein content in the cooked LD meat, compared to the C-C diet (31. 3 and 31. 5 vs 32. 4 %; P= 0. 051), and cholesterol content was found the lowest in S-S group, both in raw and cooked LD meat (49. 7 and 76. 0 mg/ 100 g).

As a solution for these problems a new flow-pack active packaging design was proposed to be developed in this investigation, based on Polylactic acid (PLA) -coated cardboard trays, with some active substances embedded into this coating (plant essential oils and gases scavengers) and the suitable wrapping film. The antimicrobial effect of this new package was studied using plant essential oils embedded in the inner coating of the cardboard tray. Essential oils are aromatic and volatile liquids extracted from plants. The chemicals in essential oils are secondary metabolites, which play an important role in plant defense, as they often possess antimicrobial properties. The interest in essential oils and their application in food preservation have been amplified in recent years by an increasingly negative consumer perception of synthetic preservatives. Furthermore, food-borne diseases are a growing public health problem worldwide, calling for more effective preservation strategies. The antibacterial properties of essential oils and their constituents have been documented extensively. The main obstacle for using essential oil constituents as food preservatives is that they are most often not powerful enough as single components, and they cause negative sensorial effects when added in sufficient amounts to provide an antimicrobial effect. Exploiting synergies between different essential oils has been suggested as a solution to this problem. The effect of them in antimicrobial packaging systems has been little studied. Because of the latter the proposal for this research was the use of a combination of vanillin, and essential oils of clove, cinnamon and thyme as antimicrobials in the new model of package. Cardboard trays coated with a film of PLA were studied in order to obtain a new active packaging friendly with the environment. During this investigation the PLA showed active properties in relation with the control of the internal atmosphere of the package used to storage “Cherry” tomatoes. This polymer belongs to the family of aliphatic polyesters commonly made from α-hydroxy acids, which include polyglycolic acid or polymandelic acid, and are considered biodegradable and compostable. PLA is a thermoplastic, high-strength, high-modulus polymer that can be made from annually renewable resources to yield articles for use in either the industrial packaging field or the biocompatible/bioabsorbable medical device market. It is easily processed on standard plastics equipment to yield molded parts, film, or fibers. In addition, it can be used for food contact and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). PLA is degraded by simple hydrolysis of the ester bond and does not require the presence of enzymes to catalyze this hydrolysis. The rate of degradation is dependent on the size and shape of the article, the isomer ratio, and the temperature of hydrolysis. Ethylene has diverse and significant effects on plant physiology. These are usually negative for the quality and shelf life of most horticultural products since this gas accelerates maturation and senescence. Modifications of the atmosphere inside the package can decrease O 2 and increase CO 2 in its interior, which allows the respiration and the production of ethylene by the fruit in the packaging to be reduced. O 2 and CO 2 modified atmosphere packages have been positively used to preserve fresh-cut tomatoes from damages. Also absorbent substances held on various inert support materials are commonly used to remove ethylene in various postharvest situations. Potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) is usually used for this purpose, being added to different absorbent materials such as activated carbon, silica gel, aluminum oxide, and clay minerals like sepiolite, to complement the properties of the active packaging. For all the above the experimental design of this investigation consisted in the following research lines: - The study of antimicrobial activity of the plant essential oils, individually and combinations of them, “in vitro” and in a food model system. - Characterization of physical and water barrier properties, for the PLA-coated cardboard, with or without some gasses scavengers. - Assesment of the practical application of the latter results in a new active packaging design with ethylene adsorption and antimicrobial characteristics. This evaluation was performed using as model food “Cherry” tomatoes. The present work has yielded some interesting results for the packaging industry. The use of vanillin and the essential oils of clove, thyme and cinnamon showed effective antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes and E. coli O 157 :H 7 “in vitro” and in the tested food model system at the concentrations used as food flavouring agent. The application of these substances in the PLA coating films has shown antimicrobial activity against the target strains studied in this work. Mixtures of plant essential oils of clove, <b>thyme</b> and cinnamon <b>leaves</b> with vanillin also inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes showing a marked synergistic effect. It could be reasonable to use these mixtures to lower the individual sensorial impact on the packed food and to enlarge the spectrum of sensitive microorganisms to this antimicrobial activity. The physical properties (thickness, weight, smoothness) and water barrier properties of PLA-coated cardboard (Water vapor permeability (WVP), Water absorptivity (WA), wetting energy (WE), and contact angle (CA)) showed an improvement of impermeability. The use of clays additives (Clinoptinolite, Sepiolite, or Sepiolite- Permanganate) reported as gasses scavengers increased the water affinity of PLAcoated paperboard but not as much as the uncoated samples. The embedding of those clays additives in the PLA coating film helps to control the humidity in the internal atmosphere of the package. These results represent an advantage for the manufacture of cardboard trays with improved humidity behavior. The compostable and environmentally friendly nature of PLA amplifies these advantages. The best results were obtained for PLA 2 % alone or with Clinoptinolite 1. 5 % or with 1 % of Sepiolite Permanganate, these conditions were the most effective in increasing the water barrier properties of cardboard. These coatings are suitable for use in cardboard trays for the packaging, storage, and transport of foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables. The PLA coating on the inside of the cardboard trays has demonstrated a very significant effect on the adsorption of ethylene and water vapour, and can be used in active packaging systems intended to “Cherry” tomatoes to regulate both factors. When this new active packaging design is applied to the preservation of “Cherry” tomatoes it is shown that in early stages of storage, there is a little production of water vapour and a high production of ethylene, which is adsorbed in the PLA layer. In later stages, ethylene production in tomatoes falls and water vapour production increases, so that ethylene may be exchanged for water vapour in the PLA layer, allowing the progressive exit of small amounts of ethylene through the wall of the thin LDPE wrapping film. Passive modified atmosphere packaging in combination with active packaging using PLA-coated cardboard trays wrapped with thin LDPE film has significantly extended the shelf life of fresh tomatoes. This is a good solution for fresh tomato packaging compared with packaging systems using trays wrapped with macroperforated films because microbial safety is better, while ethylene concentration inside the package is controlled at the same time. In addition, with the studied active packaging system, there is a considerable saving of energy during the storage and distribution of fresh tomatoes, as the storage temperature is 20 ° C, much higher than the storage temperatures usually used with modified atmosphere packaging. As a result of this thesis work, a new active packaging system has been patented. This system is based on PLA-coated cardboard trays, wrapped and thermo-sealed with LDPE film (20 μm thickness), which allows to prolong the shelf life of fresh vegetables. Some claims of this patent consider the addition of clays additives and plant essential oils to the PLA coating film in order to enhance the preservation of the packed food, acting as gasses scavengers and antimicrobials respectively. [ESP]Se estudió el efecto antimicrobiano de este nuevo envase con aceites esenciales de plantas inmersos en el recubrimiento interior de PLA de la superficie de la bandeja de cartón. Los aceites esenciales son sustancias aromáticas y volátiles extraídas de las plantas, son metabolitos secundarios, que desempeñan un papel importante en la defensa de la planta, debido en gran parte a sus propiedades antimicrobianas. El interés por los aceites esenciales y su aplicación en la conservación de alimentos se ha incrementado en los últimos años debido a la percepción cada vez más negativa de los consumidores por los conservantes sintéticos. Por otra parte, las enfermedades transmitidas por alimentos son un problema creciente en la salud pública, lo que exige estrategias de conservación más eficaces. Las propiedades antibacterianas de los aceites esenciales y sus componentes se han documentado ampliamente. Los principales obstáculos para el uso aceites esenciales como conservantes de alimentos es que no son suficientemente potentes de manera individual y el efecto sensorial suele ser negativo cuando se añaden en cantidades suficientes para proporcionar un efecto antimicrobiano.
