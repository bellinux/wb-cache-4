5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior {{to the end of}} 1948, Kennan became confident <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.|$|E
5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, the fact <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> numbers have unique factorizations means {{that one can}} determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E

30|$|In many {{practical}} control problems, {{to study}} the discrete algebraic Riccati equation (1.3), we usually assume <b>that</b> Q is <b>positive</b> semi-definite. When considering certain H-infinity problems and LQG problems and so on in some discrete control linear systems, the assumption <b>that</b> Q is <b>positive</b> definite is only required. Certainly, {{it is difficult to}} discuss this equation on the assumption <b>that</b> Q is <b>positive</b> semi-definite.

25|$|Extrapolating {{from the}} {{observations}} <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> emotional experiences boost {{the immune system}}, Roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences —sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines—may boost the immune system powerfully.

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E

25|$|Other studies {{involving}} cotton-top tamarins have hinted <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> reciprocity and reciprocal altruism {{are irrelevant}} in the prosociality of these primates.

That is, cooperation in cotton-top tamarins can be better described by mutualism than by true altruism.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} errors may {{be traced back to}} Roger Cotes's Opera Miscellanea (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir {{prepared}} by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation. The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> and negative errors are equally probable, and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors. Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve.|$|E

25|$|No serious adverse {{side effects}} from neurofeedback have been reported. Research into neurofeedback has been mostly limited and of low quality. While {{there is some}} {{indication}} {{on the effectiveness of}} biofeedback it is not conclusive: several studies have yielded positive results, however the best designed ones have either shown reduced effects or non-existing ones. In general no effects have been found in the most blinded ADHD measures, which could be indicating <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> results are due to the placebo effect.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the reason}} <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> science, {{according}} to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny {{that there is a}} problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the capture}} of Rome in 1870 from French forces of Napoleon III, Papal troops and Zouaves, {{relations}} between Italy and the Vatican remained sour for the next sixty years with the Popes declaring themselves to be prisoners in the Vatican.

It would not be until 1929 <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> relations would be restored between the Kingdom of Italy and the Vatican after the signing of the Lateran Pacts.|$|E

No specifications were made then regarding a joint bid with Portugal. On 23 November 2008, after his re-election for the RFEF presidency, Villar pledged that one of the fundamental objectives of his term was to bring a World Cup to Spain. While he did not mention whether Spain would present a joint bid with Portugal, he did not rule it out when asked about it.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|Although {{intertidal}} ecology {{has traditionally}} focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence <b>that</b> <b>positive</b> interactions are also important. Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of Juncus and Iva {{are unable to}} tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.|$|E
