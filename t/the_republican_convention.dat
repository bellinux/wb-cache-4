5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> {{was held}} on June 10–12, 1924, in Cleveland, Ohio; Coolidge was {{nominated}} on the first ballot. The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for vice president on the second ballot, but he declined; former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes was nominated on the third ballot and accepted.|$|E
5|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention,</b> Taft and Roosevelt had {{discussed}} which cabinet officers would stay on. Taft kept only Agriculture Secretary James Wilson and Postmaster General George von Lengerke Meyer (who was {{shifted to the}} Navy Department). Others appointed to the Taft cabinet included Philander Knox, who had served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Attorney General, as the new Secretary of State, and Franklin MacVeagh as Treasury Secretary.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention,</b> the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
50|$|Belton was a {{delegate}} to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>conventions</b> of 1944, 1952 and 1956.|$|R
50|$|Harper was an Alternate Delegate to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention</b> in 1976; {{he served}} as Delegate to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention</b> in 2008.|$|R

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> {{began in}} Philadelphia that June, no vice presidential {{candidate}} had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention,</b> having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected {{this to be a}} more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5000|$|NBA {{basketball}} player Kent Benson briefly competed but dropped out in March and well before <b>the</b> June <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in Indianapolis. Representative Burton introduced Delph before <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> state <b>convention</b> delegates.|$|R
50|$|An {{active member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party, Yale was a {{delegate}} to 2 different national conventions: <b>the</b> 1876 <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention</b> (which {{he was unable to}} attend due to illness) and <b>the</b> 1892 <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention</b> in Minneapolis. He also led <b>the</b> Minnesota <b>Republican</b> <b>conventions</b> in 1872, 1873 and 1880.|$|R
50|$|In 1892, 1894, 1896, 1902 and 1904 he {{was elected}} a {{delegate}} to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> State <b>Convention</b> and in 1904 he was also elected {{one of the four}} (progressive) delegates-at-large to <b>the</b> National <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> by <b>the</b> regular <b>Republican</b> State <b>Convention.</b> This was the controversial 'gymnasium convention' that looms large {{in the history of the}} progressive movement in Wisconsin.|$|R
5|$|In 1858, Blaine {{ran for a}} seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran {{for reelection}} in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was {{successful}} each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine to reduce his duties with the Advertiser in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln’s war effort and saw that the Maine Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> met first, {{convening}} in Chicago, Illinois, on June 2. Of the men {{vying for}} the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to the}} convention were former president Ulysses S. Grant, Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary John Sherman. Grant had been the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War, and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877. He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office. He was backed by Conkling's faction of the Republican Party, now known as the Stalwarts. They are mainly known for their opposition to the civil service reforms sought by President Hayes. Blaine, a senator and former representative from Maine, was backed by the Half-Breed faction of the party, which did support civil service reform. Sherman, the brother of Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, was a former senator from Ohio serving in Hayes's cabinet. He was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions.|$|E
25|$|In early April, McCain {{said he had}} {{compiled}} a list of roughly 20 potential running mates, and that he hoped to have selected a Vice President well before <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> in September.|$|E
50|$|It was the thirty-third GOP presidential nominating <b>{{convention}},</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> held in Texas (indeed, <b>the</b> first <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in <b>the</b> South outside Florida), and {{the only}} convention of either party held in Dallas.|$|R

50|$|Forbes was a {{delegate}} to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>conventions</b> of 1876, 1880 and 1884, he eventually became displeased with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party and worked successfully to get Democrat Grover Cleveland elected President.|$|R
25|$|Lieberman and Lamont {{fought a}} hotly contested and {{expensive}} primary {{battle for the}} Democratic nomination. Republican candidate Schlesinger gained his party's nomination through <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> and raised and spent relatively little. Minor candidates' fundraising was almost nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|John McCain, United States Senator from Arizona and 2008 Republican {{nominee for}} President of the United States. In his speech, McCain culminated <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> by {{accepting}} his party's nomination for President of the United States. He {{was introduced by}} a video tribute.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} after her victory at <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> McMahon fared poorly in {{political}} polls and suffered from high unfavorability ratings among both Democrats and Republicans. The Cook Political Report attributed much of the damage in her public image to months of criticism from Simmons and the media. On June 8, McMahon released her own internal polling to assure Republicans she was competitive with Blumenthal.|$|E
50|$|McKinley {{went into}} {{politics}} and {{was chairman of}} the California delegation to <b>the</b> 1904 <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention,</b> and he was chairman of <b>the</b> California <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1906.|$|R
2500|$|On Saturday, July 14, <b>the</b> Nebraska State <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> {{selected}} 32 at-large {{delegates to}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention.</b> In addition, three party leaders attend: Nebraska’s National Committeeman, Nebraska’s National Committeewoman, {{and chairman of}} <b>the</b> Nebraska <b>Republican</b> Party, who are unpledged delegates {{by virtue of their}} position. The prospective delegates indicated their presidential preference (and were bound to vote for that candidate for the first two ballots at <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention).</b> [...] This was <b>the</b> last state <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> [...] and Romney garnered support of 30 Nebraska delegates; and Ron Paul, the support of two Nebraska delegates.|$|R
50|$|Enid Greene {{remarried}} in to 2008 to then sheriff's deputy, {{and current}} judge, Scott J. Mickelsen. She was a delegate at <b>the</b> 2012 <b>Republican</b> National <b>convention,</b> served {{as chair of}} <b>the</b> 2016 <b>Republican</b> National <b>Convention</b> Site Selection Committee, and was recently appointed by RNC Chair Reince Priebus as chair of <b>the</b> 2016 <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> Rules Committee.|$|R
25|$|The 2008 Republican National Convention {{was held}} at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Prior, both cities had {{combined}} to submit bids to host both the 2008 Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention. They competed against Denver and New York for the Democratic Convention, and against New York, Cleveland and Tampa for <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention.</b> Previously, Minneapolis was host to the 1892 Republican National Convention.|$|E
25|$|Lipstick on a pig: Obama {{used this}} phrase to insinuate that any changes that McCain was advocating from the {{policies}} of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some called it sexist, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> that {{the only difference between}} a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick.|$|E
25|$|When the {{conventions}} of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views {{in a speech to}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E
50|$|Coudert was {{unsuccessful}} as a Republican {{candidate for}} district attorney of New York County in 1929, {{but was a}} delegate to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> State <b>conventions</b> from 1930 to 1948 and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National <b>Conventions</b> from 1936 to 1948.|$|R

25|$|With the {{landfall}} of Hurricane Gustav on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the White House {{canceled the}} planned appearances of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Rick Perry of Texas skipped the convention {{to remain in}} their states during the hurricane's landfall. The Monday, September 1, 2008, schedule was compressed to two hours from seven. McCain called on the party to reduce partisan activities ahead of the hurricane's arrival. The Republican Party chartered a DC-9 to fly convention delegates representing the affected areas back home to their families. The last time a major hurricane struck in a Presidential-election year was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which hit South Florida four days after <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> in Houston, Texas.|$|E
25|$|After a close race, with polls {{showing the}} two {{candidates}} neck-and-neck, Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%). After Granholm was elected Governor in 2002, arguments broke about between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor John Engler about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force {{him out of the}} 1998 race in favour of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention.</b> Engler contested that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In June 1880, while <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> was {{in session}} in Chicago, former General and President Grant {{and his family}} were living in Galena. After being persuaded by his wife and {{political}} friends to stand for a nomination and run for office a third time, he finally consented. Grant would come down town in the morning on a daily basis and would spent an hour or two with Judge Rowley, now an old friend and former comrade, at his office, and would often talk about his recent tour around the world. During the convention Rowley's office would receive many telegrams, and while Rowley and others would receive them with great interest, Grant showed little, until one arrived with some descending news about an old trusted friend, Elihu B. Washburne, also on the list of presidential nominations. Washburne, now a competitor of Grant, was withdrawing his support and making disparaging statements about Grant, which ultimately ended their long friendship. While Grant received the news in his usual calm manner, Rowley and others, however, were very outspoken with their denunciation of Washburne.|$|E
50|$|In 1882 he {{was active}} in the {{unsuccessful}} campaign of James A. Beaver for Governor.
