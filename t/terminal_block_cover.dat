50|$|One type of <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> accepts {{wires that}} are {{prepared}} only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal lugs crimped onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|R

50|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> (also called <b>terminal</b> boards or strips) {{provide a}} {{convenient}} means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{control units}} are {{typically}} wall-mounted control panels {{and can be}} mounted in a NEMA enclosure. Control units vary by technology by using line and load <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> relays, activation <b>terminals,</b> transformers, as well as monitoring electronics.|$|R

50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} components and devices sometimes have {{plug and socket}} connectors or <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> but individual screw terminals and fast-on or quick-disconnect terminals are more common. Small components have bare lead wires for soldering. They are manufactured using casting.|$|R
50|$|This town {{is close}} to Fera, about 15 minutes boat ride. The {{airfield}} is on Fera Island. It is a grass field and only 10 to 15 passenger planes land here. A new <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> was completed in April 2012.|$|R
