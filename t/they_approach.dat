5|$|Bart and his sister, Lisa, {{enter the}} empty ring {{and decide to}} settle their lifelong feud then and there. As <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> each other to throw a punch, the credits begin, but the scene {{immediately}} returns to depict Lisa easily punching Bart to the ground.|$|E
5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved, creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England. These were intended to carry artillery pieces able to engage enemy naval vessels should <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the coast, and to deter any enemy landings. As part of this programme of work, Camber Castle was considerably expanded {{at a cost of}} £5,660.|$|E
5|$|The centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes {{greater than}} Jupiter's (5.5AU) {{and less than}} Neptune's (30AU). The largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a {{diameter}} of about 250km. The first centaur discovered, 2060 Chiron, has also been classified as comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do when <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the Sun.|$|E
60|$|As <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> <b>they</b> saw a {{movement}} in front, and then three or four men ran towards them.|$|R
60|$|As <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> <b>they</b> heard a low, humming sound, {{which grew}} louder as they {{advanced}} and aroused their curiosity.|$|R

5|$|The stalk: The wolves {{attempt to}} conceal {{themselves}} as <b>they</b> <b>approach.</b> As {{the gap between the}} wolves and their prey closes, the wolves quicken their pace, wag their tails, and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{differences}} between SDOs and JFCs, {{even though many}} of the Jupiter-family comets may have originated in the scattered disc. Although the centaurs share a reddish or neutral coloration with many SDOs, their nuclei are bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference. One hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older material.|$|E
5|$|After {{an alien}} entity declaring {{itself to be}} God destroys {{spacecraft}} en route to Earth, the Enterprise is launched {{under the command of}} Admiral Kirk to engage the vessel. He re-assembles the former crew, including Spock, and sets out to intercept the alien. As <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the entity, it transports a humanoid probe on board the Enterprise that takes a variety of forms—including that of Jesus. The crew determine that the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets to teach their inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development. The being is malfunctioning; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension.|$|E
60|$|After some hours' marching, at {{two o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> Chollet. On the way they received considerable reinforcements, from the villages they passed through. As soon as <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the town <b>they</b> saw the dragoons pouring out, followed by three or four hundred National Guards.|$|R

5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Imperial Bedrooms is a {{novel by}} American author Bret Easton Ellis. Released on June 15, 2010, it is the sequel to Less Than Zero, Ellis' 1985 bestselling {{literary}} debut, which was shortly followed by a film adaptation in 1987. Imperial Bedrooms revisits Less Than Zeros self-destructive and disillusioned youths as <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> middle-age in the present day. Like Ellis' earlier novel, which took its name from Elvis Costello's 1977 song of the same name, Imperial Bedrooms is named after Costello's 1982 album.|$|E

5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as <b>they</b> <b>approach.</b> To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|It is now mid-February 2154, and Enterprise is {{en route}} to the Xindi Council. Under escort by Degra's ship, Captain Archer is briefed by him on the five member species of the Council. Other {{friendly}} Xindi ships soon join the escort. As <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the planet, however, the flagship of Reptilian Commander Dolim intervenes. After a tense standoff, Dolim backs down. On the planet, Archer and Ensign Sato enter the Council chamber and present their evidence to the gathered representatives; Dolim, angered at the move, walks out in protest. A Guardian appears to him later, promising Reptilian dominance if he continues their original plan.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as <b>they</b> <b>approach,</b> the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As <b>they</b> <b>approach,</b> two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.|$|E
5|$|The male common {{chiffchaff}} {{is highly}} territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20metres (66ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds {{may also be}} attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how <b>they</b> <b>approach</b> it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
