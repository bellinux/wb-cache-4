5000|$|The Audi A4 {{automobile}} layout {{consists of}} a longitudinal engine front-engine design, with transaxle-type <b>transmissions</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of}} the engine. The cars are front-wheel drive, or on some models, [...] "quattro" [...] all-wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|Many Powerglides {{share the}} same length, 27 spline output shaft, and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounting</b> as the THM 350; thus, the {{transmissions}} are easily interchangeable for owners wanting three speeds instead of two. Other Powerglides came with an incompatible 16 spline output shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{compact and}} {{efficient}} layout [...] - [...] a transversely-mounted engine with <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> beside the engine driving {{the front wheels}} through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts [...] - [...] subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.|$|R
5000|$|The Fina-Sport was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1953 until 1954. The {{brainchild of}} Perry Fina, it used a [...] Cadillac V-8 engine and Hydramatic <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Ford chassis. Styling of both convertibles and hardtops was by Vignale.|$|R
50|$|Mister Transmission {{performs}} multi-check inspections. These inspections include: {{checking the}} transmission fluid, a road test, a lift inspection checking: neutral switch, engine rpm, throttle linkage, modulators, <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts,</b> u-joints, fluid retention, and electronic controls, while also doing a pan inspection which checks {{the inside of}} the transmission.|$|R

The <b>mount</b> <b>support</b> structure conforms to flight crash safety requirements with high margins of safety. Restraint cables reinforce the mounts in the critical loaded forward direction limiting maximum forward system deflection to 1 1 / 4 inches...|$|R
50|$|Because the 911 {{air-cooled}} crankcase {{uses the}} Porsche 356 engine to <b>transmission</b> <b>mounting</b> flange configuration, the 996 GT3 used a manual gearbox also of air-cooled 911 heritage. This gearbox has interchangeable gear ratios {{and is more}} durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard 911 type 996 gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} of the S4 have their <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> immediately {{at the rear of}} the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and like all Audi [...] "S" [...] cars, are only available as standard with Audis quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, using a Torsen-based centre differential system.|$|R

5000|$|Often {{called the}} [...] "steel-case" [...] {{transmission}} for its steel shell, {{in contrast to}} the later W-series transmissions' aluminium case. This transmission is mostly associated with early Celicas of the 1970s. It is also shorter from the bellhousing face to the <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> than the later aluminium case W-series transmissions, despite using the same mount.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Dennis {{developed}} the Falcon single-deck bus with longitudinally-mounted rear engine. The Falcon H variant had a horizontal Gardner engine with the Voith gearbox mounted {{ahead of the}} rear axle, the later Falcon HC had the Voith <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the rear axle and close-coupled to the Gardner engine. The Falcon V variant had vertical engines.|$|R
5000|$|Fiat quickly {{demonstrated}} the layouts flexibility, re-configuring the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9, and the compact, efficient layout [...] - [...] a transversely-mounted engine with <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> beside the engine driving {{the front wheels}} through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts [...] - [...] subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.|$|R

50|$|In {{critical}} {{military and}} commercial aerospace applications, material engineers commonly specify VIM-VAR steels. VIM means Vacuum Induction Melted and VAR means Vacuum Arc Remelted. VIM-VAR steels become bearings for jet engines, rotor shafts for military helicopters, flap actuators for fighter jets, gears in jet or helicopter <b>transmissions,</b> <b>mounts</b> or fasteners for jet engines, jet tail hooks and other demanding applications.|$|R
25|$|Not {{technically}} an armament subsystem, the XM156/M156 universal <b>mount</b> provided <b>mounting</b> <b>supports</b> and racks for {{a number}} of systems used on the UH-1 series of helicopters.|$|R
30|$|In {{taking these}} {{elements}} into account, the conceptual idea of combining {{the area of}} the top longitudinal rail, the strut tower and the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> into a single large aluminium alloy cast component was developed. This area has stringent requirements regarding crash safety of the vehicle, e.g. in case of a head-on collision, and the torsion and flexural stiffness of the entire vehicle structure.|$|R
50|$|After the 128, Fiat further {{demonstrated}} the layouts flexibility, re-configurating the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9. The compact, efficient Giacosa layout — a transversely-mounted engine with <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> beside the engine driving {{the front wheels}} through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts, combined with MacPherson struts and an independently located radiator — subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.|$|R
5000|$|The 1964 {{model year}} Classics, were refined with {{stainless}} steel rocker moldings, a flush single-plane aluminum grille replacing the previous year's deep concave design, and oval tail-lamps replacing the flush mounted lenses of the 1963's. Classics with bucket seats and V8 engine could be ordered {{with a new}} [...] "Shift-Command" [...] three-speed automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on the center console that could be shifted manually.|$|R
5000|$|The TU {{engine is}} distantly {{related to the}} older X-Type engine - sharing a similar {{overhead}} camshaft architecture, but the key differences are the belt driven camshaft (the X is chain driven), and that the TU is mounted in a conventional upright position with a separate, end-on <b>mounted</b> <b>transmission</b> and unequal length driveshafts. The X engine, by comparison, had an integral <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the side of}} the crankcase (giving rise to its popular nickname the [...] "suitcase engine"), sharing a common oil supply and was mounted almost lying flat on its side within the car.|$|R

5000|$|The American M26 Pershing was {{designed}} as a medium tank to replace the M4 Sherman, and contained many features common on post-war MBTs. These features include an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> in the rear, torsion bar suspension [...] and had an early form of powerpack. The M26, however, suffered from a relatively weak engine, and was somewhat under powered. [...] The design of the M26 had profound influence on American postwar medium and Main Battle tanks: ...|$|R
2500|$|Cylinder wheels {{provide a}} long, wide surface with no center <b>mounting</b> <b>support</b> (hollow). [...] They {{can be very}} large, up to 12" [...] in width. [...] They are used only in {{vertical}} or horizontal spindle grinders.|$|R
50|$|As {{pressure}} from the parents <b>mounted,</b> <b>supported</b> in part by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, in October 2003 Israel's Judge Advocate General Menachem Finkelstein ordered the IDF to open a further military police investigation into Hurndall's death.|$|R
50|$|After serving {{two years}} in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Stempel joined GM's Oldsmobile Division as a senior {{detailer}} in the chassis design department in 1958, later serving as senior designer (1962); transmission design engineer (1964); motor engineer (1969); and assistant chief engineer (1972). Stempel subsequently worked on the team that developed the 1966 Toronado, the first modern American front-wheel-drive car.

50|$|The Fl 282 Kolibri was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} Flettner Fl 265 announced in July 1940, which pioneered the same intermeshing rotor configuration that the Kolibri used. It had a 7.7 litre displacement, seven-cylinder Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine of 150-160 hp mounted {{in the center of}} the fuselage, with a <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on the front of the engine from which a drive shaft ran to an upper gearbox, which then split the power to a pair of opposite-rotation drive shafts to turn the rotors.|$|R
5000|$|Although Lordstown Assembly had a {{purpose-built}} exit {{off of the}} Ohio Turnpike {{built to}} make shipment easier, the Vega was designed for vertical shipment, nose down. General Motors and Southern Pacific designed [...] "Vert-A-Pac" [...] rail cars to hold 30 Vegas each, compared with conventional tri-level autoracks which held 18. The Vega was fitted with four removable cast-steel sockets on the underside and had plastic spacers - removed at unloading - to protect engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts.</b> The rail car ramp/doors were opened and closed via forklift.|$|R
