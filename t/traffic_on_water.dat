The {{aim of this}} research was to study the effect of compaction induced by tractor <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> availability in the soil under different traffic intensities on the same path (0, 1, 3, 6 and 10 passages), to two tractors with 3. 3 and 2. 6 ton of weights, over three different surface conditions. The study was conducted in an Andisol, representative soil of the study area. It was determined the behavior of the water retention curve, obtaining the gravitational water, available water and hygroscopic water, to 10 and 30 cm of depth. The hygroscopic water is the most prevalent with values &# 8203;&# 8203;of up to 80 % of the total water present in the soil. The water retention curves showed increases in the values &# 8203;&# 8203;of field capacity and wilting point and behaviors "flattened" indicating a high sensitivity to the applied treatments, representative of compacted soils, which give the surfaces studied characteristics do not suitable for normal crop development...|$|E
40|$|Wuchi {{used to be}} a small fishery harbor besides middle-west cost on Taiwan, until Chien-Long {{period of}} Chkng dynasty. During Tao-Kwang period, Wuchi was not only a {{transitional}} location along the coast of western Taiwan, but an export harbor of farm harvest. There were twenty there warehouses (five Hwang’s and eighteen Tsai’s) and forty six shops. In the Tung-Chih period, it had occurred “The Camphor War”. This incident resulted Wuchi became more important in Taiwan developing history. In the early japan occupied period, Wuchi had been already to be ordered a “special export and import harbor”. Taiwan’s governor general prepared the construction plan of Hsin-Kao urban development. Due to tense of “The Pacific War”, the plan about Hsin-Kao port was forced to cease. After retrocession form Japan occupied period, the government drew up reconstruction plan about Taichung Harbor for five years, but was finally forced to terminate because of financial reasons. Some officials form Taichung area went to Taipei to give a fully statement about the reconstruction plan after 1947. It established “Taichung Habor Engineering Bureau” formally in 1971 to advocate building project. In 1976, the first stage project was completed and then opened to trade.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies of soil hydraulic properties. The hydraulic properties of soils are very important properties which deal with the transport of water and solutes in the soils. In the first study, Shelby tubes were used to collect undisturbed soil samples at depths of 2 to 12 m from several glacial till profiles. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and chloride breakthrough curves were made on the soil samples within the Shelby tubes {{as well as on}} soil removed from Shelby tubes and resealed into permeameters. Paraffin wax was used to seal soil into permeameters. Saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements indicated that conductivity decreased with depth from 1. 85 x 10 [superscript]- 6 cm s[superscript]- 1 to 1. 64 x 10 [superscript]- 7 cm s[superscript]- 1. Below a 9 m depth, however, the conductivity remained nearly unchanged. The results of saturated hydraulic conductivity and chloride breakthrough obtained from soil samples within Shelby tubes and soil samples removed from Shelby tubes were different. Larger saturated hydraulic conductivity values and early chloride breakthrough obtained from the soil samples within the Shelby tubes indicated side-wall flow effect;In the second study, undisturbed soil samples were obtained from the surface A horizon to characterize the effects of two tillage systems (no-till and chisel plow) and <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> retention and transport of water, chemicals and air in the soil. The results obtained in this study showed that in general tillage did not significantly affect these properties. Traffic generally affected these properties significantly. No-wheel traffic samples tended to retain more water at or near saturation than did wheel traffic samples. Wheel traffic reduced unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Air permeability values were also decreased because of wheel traffic;In the third study, a method is presented for estimating unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from air permeability data. Twelve undisturbed soil samples were obtained from the surface A horizon of a Tama soil. Samples were collected from the middle of wheel traffic and no-wheel traffic interrows. Air permeability was measured for each sample at selected soil matric potentials. A theoretical model relating air permeability to air filled porosity was developed. The model contains a parameter {{that can be used to}} predict unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The model parameter was determined for each soil sample by curve fitting the model to the measured air permeability data. The model parameter for each sample was then used to predict unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for each sample. Predicted unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values were compared to estimated values from transient outflow method. The results of this study indicated that unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be estimated reasonably well from air permeability data...|$|E

50|$|A {{glance at}} a map is suggestive of a fourth possibility. Malacañan {{is on the right}} bank of the Pasig River, and there is a Tagalog word {{referring}} to “of the right,” which is malakánan. But so what? The river is somewhat long and meandering, with a correspondingly lengthy right bank. However, the river at Malacañan divides around the Isla de Convalecencia as it does nowhere else along its course. Hence, the need to make a distinction between left and right would seem to be most relevant at this very place. Perhaps then, Malacañan’s origin is as a point of reference in the lively and ancient <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> of the Pasig river.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then there}} came {{suddenly}} the railway and the steamship, the former opening with extraordinary abruptness {{a series of}} vast through-routes for trade, the latter enormously increasing the security and economy of the <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> the old <b>water</b> routes. For a time neither of these inventions {{was applied to the}} needs of intra-urban transit at all. For a time they were purely centripetal forces. They worked simply to increase the general volume of trade, to increase, that is, the pressure of population upon the urban centres. As a consequence the social history of the middle and later thirds of the nineteenth century, not simply in England but all over the civilized world, is the history of a gigantic rush of population into the magic radius of--for most people--four miles, to suffer there physical and moral disaster less acute but, finally, far more appalling to the imagination than any famine or pestilence that ever swept the world.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of soil compaction caused by tractor wheel <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> the limiting <b>water</b> range (LLWR), shoot growth and levels of compaction and four replications in a completely randomized experimental design. Soil samples with preserved structure were collected in the layers: 0. 02 - 0. 05; 0. 08 - 0. 11; 0. 15 - 0. 18 and 0. 22 - 0. 25 m to determine macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density, resistance to penetration and LLWR. The evaluated corn parameters were: plant and first spike height, steam diameter, number of spikes per plant, plant dry matter, dry matter of 1000 seeds and seed productivity. The soil compaction restricted all corn parameters except the number of spikes per plant and dry matter of 1000 seeds. The LLWR was reduced by the soil resistance to penetration, even in the tilled soil with bulk density of 1. 12 Mg m- 3. Only the treatment with 11 Mg tractor, repeated four times on the area, demonstrated bulk density above critical bulk density in the LLWR that was 1. 37 Mg m- 3, where the seed productivity was significantly smaller...|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} way of {{reaching}} the falls is through the Shooting the rapids boat ride, which originates {{from any of the}} resorts along Bumbungan and Balanac Rivers. Two skilled and licensed boatmen takes one to three passengers on wooden or fiberglass, long, narrow canoes to the falls, which could take more than an hour of paddling upstream depending <b>on</b> <b>traffic</b> and <b>water</b> level. The journey takes passengers through the narrow and verdant Pagsanjan Gorge lined with huge boulders, rocks and small waterfalls. The ride upstream ends in a natural pool below the falls where an optional raft ride takes visitors through a curtain of cascading water to the Devil's cave behind the falls. The return trip called Shooting the rapids is a thrill ride through fourteen rapids as the skilled boatmen maneuvers the boat through the narrow rocks as it head downstream.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the present}} work, the {{dependency}} of air traffic climate effects {{with respect to}} the emission location and altitude is investigated by means of the three-dimensional chemistry-climate-model ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM/ATTILA. Numerous simulations employing idealized aircraft-like emissions are carried out to systematically study effects of air <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> contrail coverage, <b>water</b> vapour, ozone and methane and air traffic induced radiative forcing {{with respect to the}} emission location and altitude. For the composition of present day air traffic emissions, the overall radiative forcing from non-CO 2 effects increases strongly with emission altitude and slightly from the extra-tropics to the tropics, with the largest potential contributions resulting from ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The results of these idealized simulations are used to test whether the climate impact of a realistic air traffic inventory can be reconstructed by linearly recombining these pre-calculated idealized data. This methodology may be particularly useful for the optimization of flight paths with respect to minimum climate impact, as this off-line reconstruction of air traffic perturbations could bypass time consuming global three-dimensional simulations. Perturbations determined by the linear recombination indeed compare well with effects determined by comprehensive chemistry-climate-model simulations. Furthermore, the findings indicate a high potential to reduce non-CO 2 air traffic climate effects through optimized flight routing...|$|R

The Value of Outdoor Experiences Most children appear to benefit from being outdoors.
