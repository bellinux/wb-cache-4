Finite element or radiosity approaches can achieve interactive simulations for some classes of diffuse-only scenes, but more general methods are currently too slow and <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> interactive use.

This is achieved using a radiosity algorithm producing smooth, noise free simulation of diffuse light transfers, and an integrated particle trace for rapid, high quality specular reflec-tions such as caustics. Using our system, users can interactively visualize and manipulate small environ-ments with global illumination including specular effects. Such general lighting effects can also be simulated for larger environments, albeit at a higher compu-tational cost.

All available depth extraction techniques with macroscopic objects are based on variance; however, the effectiveness of this is object dependent. We propose to use disparity between corresponding points in intensity reconstructions to determine depth. Our method requires a single hologram of a scene, from which we reconstruct two different perspectives. In the reconstruction the phase information is not needed, which makes this method useful for in-line digital holography.

A General Radio Company precision sound-level meter {{was used to measure}} noise levels in ten volume feeding operations ranging in output from 1, 000 to 9, 000 meals per day. Sound pressure levels (SPL's) were taken on the A weighing scale of the sound-level meter at slow response for background noise and at fast response for impact noise, noting the rate per minute at which the impacts occurred. Sound pressure levels were taken at all work stations and in areas where communication, supervisory or clerical work took place at times of maximum operation, and in dining areas at or near capacity occupation. The results are compared to governmental codes for permissible noise exposure and to speech interference levels. At only one work station in one operation was the background noise SPL in excess of the damage risk level of 90 dBA. The station had a SPL of 99 dB, to which a worker can only be exposed {{for two and a half}} hours without being in violation of Walsh-Healey Act and the Noise Control Safety Orders for the State of California and without risking hearing loss. All pot and dish machine operations had background noise levels averaging 82 dBA and impact noise here was highest and most frequent in terms of occurrence per minute. A large battery of steam equipment also produced a high SPL of 81 dBA.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of an Automatic Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Detection tool (AICMED) for the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI). CMEs observed with heliospheric imagers are much more difficult to detect than those observed by coronagraphs as they have a lower contrast compared with the background light, have a larger range of intensity variation and are easily confused with other transient activity. CMEs appear in SMEI images as very faint often-fragmented arcs amongst a much brighter and often variable background. AICMED operates along the same lines as Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus), using the Hough Transform on elongation-time J-maps to extract straight lines from the data set. We compare AICMED results with manually measured CMEs on almost three years of data from early in SMEI operations. AICMED identified 83 verifiable events. Of these 46 could be matched with manually identified events, the majority of the non-detections can be explained. The remaining 37 AICMED events were newly discovered CMEs. The proportion of false identification was high, at 71 % of the autonomously detected events. We find that AICMED is very effective as a region of interest highlighter, and is a promising first step in autonomous heliospheric imager CME detection, but the SMEI data are <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> the tool to be completely automated...|$|R
40|$|Background: Steric {{strain in}} protein {{three-dimensional}} structures {{is related to}} unfavorable inter-atomic interactions. The steric strain may {{be a result of}} packing or functional requirements, or may indicate an error in the coordinates of a structure. Detailed energy functions are, however, usually considered <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> error detection. Results: After a short energy refinement, a full-atom, detailed energy function becomes a sensitive indicator of errors. The statistics of the energy distribution of amino acid residues in high-resolution crystal structures, represented by models with idealized covalent geometry, were calculated. The interaction energy of each residue with the whole protein structure and with the solvent was considered. Normalized deviations of amino acid residue energies from their average values were used for detecting energy-strained and, therefore, potentially incorrect fragments of a polypeptide chain. Protein three-dimensional structures of different origin (X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, theoretical models and deliberately misfolded decoys) were compared. Examples of the applications to loop and homology modeling are provided. Conclusions:Elevated levels of energy strain may point at a problematic fragment in a protein three-dimensional structure of either experimental or theoretical origin. The approach may be useful in model building and refinement, modeling by homology, protein design, folding calculations, and protein structure analysis...|$|R

Recent work has pursued this approach by exploring various ways of connecting the visual and text domains. In this paper, we revisit this idea by going further to consider one important factor: the textual representation is usually <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> the zero-shot learning application. This observation motivates us to design a simple yet effective zero-shot learning method {{that is capable of}} suppressing noise in the text. Specifically, we propose an l 2, 1 -norm based objective function which can simultaneously suppress the noisy signal in the text and learn a function to match the text document and visual features. We also develop an optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting problem. By conducting experiments on two large datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms those competing methods which rely on online information sources but with no explicit noise suppression. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analysis of the proposed method and provide insight as to what kind of information in documents is useful for zero-shot learning.

This project examined the feasibility of using an almost silent linear actuator to power a flapping wing UAV. In order to this, a wing was designed and installed into a test set-up to replicate normal flight conditions of flapping wing flight (FWF). The designs of the wing, the test set-up and the actual experiments were biomimetic, looking to approximate the flight of real birds. The main goal {{of this study was}} to characterize a novel new linear actuator being developed in the Bio-Instrumentation Lab at MIT based on important parameters for FWF including the mounting position, the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of oscillation of the wing. Ultimately the linear actuator performed well under all of the tests and was only limited by the control software. When the frequency and amplitude of oscillation were raised, the force on the actuator increased. The mounting position ended up not having a correlation with the force on the actuator, leading one to believe that it is not a critical parameter for this actuator-wing system. by Christopher L.

Examples of cDocs are a news article consisting of several html pages, or a set of pages describing specifications, price, and reviews of a digital camera. Being able to identify cDocs would be useful in many applications including web and intranet search, user navigation, automated collection generation, and information extraction. In the past, several heuristic approaches have been proposed to identify cDocs [1][5]. However, heuristics fail to capture the variety of types, styles and goals {{of information on the}} web, and do not account {{for the fact that the}} definition of a cDoc often depends on the context. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of three machine learning-based algorithms for cDoc discovery. These algorithms are responsive to the varying structure of cDocs and adaptive to their application-specific nature. Based on our previous work [4], this paper proposes a different scenario for discovering cDocs, and compares in this new setting the local machine learned clustering algorithm from [4] to a global purely graph based approach [3] and a Conditional Markov Network approach previously applied to noun coreference task [6]. The results show that the approach of [4] outperforms the other algorithms, suggesting that global relational characteristics of web sites are <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> cDoc identification purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{implication}} as a representation for empirical associations and for deduction as {{a mode of}} inference requires a mechanism extraneous to deduction to manage uncertainty associated with inference. Consequently, the interpretation of representations of uncertainty is unclear. Representativeness, or degree of fit, is proposed as an interpretation of degree of belief for classification tasks. The calculation of representative-ness depends {{on the nature of the}} associations between evidence and conclusions. Patterns of associations are characterized as endorsements of conclusions. We discuss an expert system that uses endorsements to control the search for the most represen-tative conclusion, given evidence. Tasks can be classified by the kinds of uncertainty that characterize them. Planning tasks, for example, arc characterized by uncertainty about the interactions of plan steps.

Recently, ammunition manufacturers have started producing and popularizing ammunition with zinc (Zn), titanium (Ti), and gadolinium (Gd) primer components that are non‐toxic to the environment. This paper discusses the development of the Ole Miss Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry’s first LIBS instrument for forensic analysis of lead‐free using Gd as a tracer element for identification purposes. A Silva method of sampling was adopted using a non‐emissive 3 M tape to lift GSR from the subject’s hands after firing the weapon.

The mid-infrared spectra of the sources are continuum dominated, and 12 sources show deep silicate absorption with tau_ 9. 7 ~ 1 - 2. Combining mid-infrared and optical spectra, we achieve 86 % spectroscopic completeness which allows us to confirm that most (63 + 14 - 22 %) z~ 2 radio-intermediate quasars are obscured. The new spectra also prove that many high-redshift type- 2 quasars do not show any rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines. From the 18 individual mid-infrared spectra, we classify most of the sources into three subsamples: those with hints of the 7. 7 and 6. 2 micron polyaromatic hydrocarbons (3 / 18 sources show PAHs, subsample A), those with an excess of emission around 8 micron but no hint of the 6. 2 micron PAH (7 / 18 cases, subsample B) and pure-continuum sources with no visible excess (4 / 18 sources, subsample C). The remaining 4 / 18 sources have spectra that are featureless or <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> any features to be visible.

This computer used about a thousand valves and was a major factor in helping British Intelligence to break the German codes, though details of this were only released in 2000. After the war, the success of Colossus encouraged him to contemplate the possibility of telephone exchanges each using tens of thousands of valves.

However, a fully electronic prototype Time Division Multiplex Model Exchange was constructed at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill and then an experimental TDM exchange system was built and tested at Highgate Wood, North London, in 1962, but it was found to be beyond the technology of the time: the solid-state switching worked well, but the analogue transmission (which had worked on the short cable runs of a laboratory model at Dollis Hill) was <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> public service on the long cable runs of a large exchange.

30|$|Here, we {{show how}} MFA {{can provide a}} step change in the resolving power of the STM, and how it has {{significantly}} {{changed the way we}} approach STM experiments. By knowing beforehand that we will perform MFA, we now acquire a sequential set of tens or hundreds of frames with the same imaging conditions (e.g. we keep the following parameters fixed: field of view, scan orientation and speed, sample bias, tunneling current, and feedback settings). In the past, we would have stopped acquiring images unless they were of higher quality than those previously captured. We demonstrate the power of the MFA approach with three examples to highlight separately the improvement of the fidelity, sensitivity, and selectivity in the STM data. The first example, imaging of the Si(111)-(7 [*]×[*] 7) reconstruction, is chosen because it is familiar to most users of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) STMs and can, therefore, serve as an initial experiment for others to perform to repeat our results. For the Si(111) surface, we demonstrate a[*]~[*]sixfold improvement of the SNR ratio by averaging 41 raw images. The second example demonstrates a new result {{that would not have been}} observed without MFA. We are able to distinguish with sub-picometre precision the two different adsorption sites (fcc and hcp) of Ti atoms in a (2 [*]×[*] 2) honeycomb Ti 2 O 3 monolayer on an Au(111) substrate. The final example shows how automated template matching can be used to distinguish chiral unit cells of the SrTiO 3 (111)-(4 [*]×[*] 4) reconstruction.

The kinetics data are <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> reliable quantitative analysis, but qualitatively indicate faster kinetics in mineral-matter-rich regions. In the Baralaba sample, CO 2 preferentially invaded the smallest micropores and the confined CO 2 density was up to five times that of the free CO 2. Faster CO 2 sorption kinetics was found to be correlated with higher mineral matter content but, the mineral-matter-rich regions had lower-density CO 2 confined in their pores. Remarkably, the kinetics was pore-size dependent, being faster for smaller pores. These results suggest that injection into the permeable section of an interbedded coal-clastic sequence could provide a viable combination of reasonable injectivity and high sorption capacity.

"I am very glad, Mr. Armstrong," [...] Hiram Powlett said, one evening, {{when they}} {{happened}} to be the first two to arrive in the snuggery, [...] "that my Ruth seems to take to your daughter. It's a real comfort to Hesba and me. You would have thought that she would have taken to some of the girls she went to school with, but she hasn't. I suppose she is too quiet for them, and they are <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>for</b> her. Anyhow, until now, she has never had a friend, and I think it will do her a world of good. It's bad for a girl to be alone, and especially a girl like Ruth. I don't mind telling you, Mr. Armstrong, that Hesba and I have an idea that she has got something on her mind, she has been so changed altogether since Miss Carne's murder. I might have thought that she had fretted about that scamp Forester going away, for at one time the girl was very fond of him, but before it happened {{she told me that she}} had found out he would never make her a good husband, and would break it off altogether with him; so you see I don't think his going away had anything to do with it. Once or twice I thought she was going to say something particular to me, but she has never said it, and she sits there and broods and broods till it makes my heart ache to see her. Now she has got your daughter to be friends with, perhaps she may shake it off." ...|$|R
