5|$|Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final and it {{was their}} local rivals who had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the 14th minute. Patrick Vieira {{equalised}} just after Tottenham captain Sol Campbell {{was taken off the}} pitch to receive treatment. Tottenham managed to withstand pressure from Arsenal for most of the second half, but came unstuck in the 73rd minute when Pirès scored the decisive goal.|$|E
5|$|Denis Menchov won the race, having <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> a {{long time}} trial in stage 12, and defended vigorously against attacks by his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the {{mountain}} stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41seconds behind the winner, and won the mauve jersey as points classification winner. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn Rovers defender Jack O'Connell {{was signed}} on a one-month loan, while Salford City defender Jameel Ible was signed on a {{contract}} {{for the rest of}} the season. Blanchett was released after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent. York were leading Gillingham 1–0 away before the home team equalised five minutes from time through Cody McDonald, with York having <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the 17th minute through a McLaughlin goal straight from a corner kick. Striker David McDaid was signed from League of Ireland Premier Division club Derry City on a one-and-a-half-year contract for a small compensation fee, while defender Curtis Obeng was signed on a one-month loan from Premier League club Swansea City after Lanre Oyebanjo was ruled out for around six weeks with a fractured skull.|$|E

5|$|Fàbregas {{started in}} {{the centre of the}} front three of a 4–3–3 {{formation}} against Italy in Spain's opening Group C match, essentially acting as a false 9. In the 64th minute he scored the equaliser after Italy had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the 61st minute; the game finished in a 1–1 draw. He then scored his second goal of the tournament in the next group stage match against Ireland, which ended in a 4–0 win to Spain. When Spain faced Portugal in the semi-finals and the game remained scoreless at the end of extra time, Fàbregas scored the winning penalty of the shootout as Spain prevailed 4–2. In the final against Italy, Fàbregas started and provided the assist to David Silva for the game's opening goal, en route to a 4–0 Spain victory.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Smith made a {{permanent}} move to Luton {{for a fee}} of £50,000 shortly after the transfer window opened. York won 3–0 in their New Year's Day home fixture against Burton, with Walker, McLaughlin and Blair scoring. Carlisle completed {{a permanent}} transfer to Northampton after the conclusion of his loan, while Henderson signed for Gateshead permanently after an agreement was reached over {{the remainder of his}} York contract. York were beaten 2–1 at home to Exeter, with a Rodman own goal giving the visitors the lead in the 14th minute. Potts equalised for York five minutes later, before Exeter scored the winning goal on 53 minutes through Jimmy Keohane. Rodman's loan from Aldershot was extended {{until the end of the}} season. Walker scored in the 84th minute to secure York a 1–1 draw away to Cheltenham, who had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the 67th minute through Shaun Harrad. Striker Ben Everson, who last played for Breiðablik in the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild, was signed on a contract for the rest of the season. Platt was loaned out for the second time in a season, joining Conference North club FC Halifax Town for one month. Everson made his debut as a 71st-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at home to Aldershot.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{began their}} {{campaign}} at Selhurst Park on 8 August against Crystal Palace, with Carl Fletcher captaining his new side against his former club. An early goal from Hungarian international centre-back Krisztián Timár put Argyle ahead but the home side responded {{in the second}} half to give both teams a share of the points. Argyle faced Queens Park Rangers in their first home game of the season and an injury-time own goal from Kaspars Gorkšs salvaged a point after the visitors had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the first-half. Alan Gow's first goal for the club in their next match against Cardiff City was merely a consolation, as a hat-trick from Michael Chopra consigned Argyle to their first league defeat of the season. A stoppage time goal from Derby County's Miles Addison denied Argyle their third draw of the season after they had taken a first-half lead through Alan Judge, and a second 3–1 home defeat followed a week later, this time against Sheffield Wednesday. A first-half goal from Jamie Mackie gave Argyle hope of their first victory of new the season at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, but the home side responded with three goals either side of half-time to claim a comfortable win.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{possessed a}} {{numerical}} superiority {{of two to}} one, and their advanced post, commanded by Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, overlooked all parts of Frederick's camp. The French and Habsburg Imperial (Reichsarmee) troops consisted of 62 battalions (31,000 infantry), 84 squadrons (10,000) of cavalry, and 109 artillery, totaling some 4142,000 men, under Soubise's and Saxe-Hildburghausen's command. The Allies had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the maneuvers of the previous days, and Hildburghausen {{decided to take the}} offensive. He had some difficulty inducing Soubise to risk a battle, so the Allies did not begin to move from their campground until after eleven a.m. on 5 November. Soubise probably intended to engage as late in the day as possible, with the idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action before nightfall. Their plan called for the Allied army to march by Zeuchfeld, around Frederick's left, which no serious natural obstacle covered, and to deploy in battle array facing north, between Reichardtswerben on the right and Pettstädt on the left. Saxe-Hildburghausen's proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise appeared equally likely to succeed by taking this position, which threatened to cut Frederick off from a retreat to the towns on the Saale. The Allies could only attain this position by marching around the Prussian flank, which could put them in the tenuous position of marching across their enemies' front. Consequently, the Allies posted a sizable guard against the obvious risk of interference on their exposed flank.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the British had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> {{trade with the}} Duala.

On 10 June 1840 and 7 May 1841, Akwa and Bell became the first to sign anti-slavery treaties. In exchange, the Europeans provided these rulers with annual gifts of alcohol, guns, textiles, and other goods. In addition, the rulers outlawed practices the British viewed as barbaric, such as sacrificing a chief's wives upon his death.|$|E

Diazepam, along with oxazepam, nitrazepam and temazepam, represents 82% of the benzodiazepine market in Australia.

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the next}} year the city claimed the church as an urban-renewal parcel, and {{the next year}} its Urban Renewal Agency paid $96,000 for it.

Newburgh had in the past <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> historic preservation when Washington's Headquarters had become the first officially-designated historic site in the U.S. in 1850.
