5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using.</b>|$|E
5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood in his coat pocket.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
50|$|Because silhouettes give a {{very clear}} image, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often <b>used</b> in any field where the speedy {{identification}} of an object is necessary. Silhouettes have many practical applications. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> for traffic signs (see pic below). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to identify towns or countries with silhouettes of monuments or maps. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> in forensic science.|$|R

5|$|A secret brotherhood summons {{a dragon}} from its native dimension, {{so as to}} cause {{destruction}} and mayhem across the city of Ankh-Morpork. Rumours of the dragon's rampage across the city reaches Unseen University. Since the Archchancellor wishes the involvement {{of at least one}} wizard in the matter, Rincewind is summoned to handle the problem. After acquiring a book to learn what is needed to track the dragon to its lair, Rincewind searches the city for the various components needed to assemble a dragon detector and brings them back to the Archchancellor. After the Archancellor lets slip that the dragon's lair is stocked with gold, Rincewind snatches the dragon detector from him, searches the city, finds the lair, and takes all the gold within it. Just before he leaves, the dragon stops him and requests his aid in removing the brotherhood's hold upon her, claiming <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> her for evil and are planning to make her go on a major rampage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a good actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>using</b> the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{literature}} can {{be confusing}} because many authors fail to explain whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> the ideal gas constant R, or the specific gas constant Rs. The {{relationship between the}} two constants is Rs = R / m, where m is the molecular mass of the gas.|$|E

25|$|Independent {{telephone}} companies and rural carriers of North America probably {{have the highest}} total number of ADSL2+ subscribers collectively as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> such technology to deliver the so-called triple play voice, video and data services in order {{to compete with the}} RBOCs and cable companies with their incumbent local exchange carrier and competitive local exchange carrier footprint.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not yet}} known if gesturing helps or not {{in finding}} the word in a TOT experience. This is because it is unclear if the {{participant}} is using gestures as their regular form of communication that accompanies language or if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> gestures {{in order to help}} them overcome their TOT experience and retrieve the target word.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows {{two young}} men playing a ball game. It looks as though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> their hands for the game; however, kicking {{certainly}} cannot be excluded. It is notable {{for the fact that}} most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.|$|E

While learning to ski, skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski-bras, bungi cords, outriggers, slant boards or toe boards. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|In some city, {{the fare}} {{of the public}} {{transportation}} depends on the travel distance, such as the MRT in Taipei, Taiwan. This increases the transportation expense for those who has been move to the urban area, what's more, they have less money to earn by investment because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> all of money to pay their daily expense already. For example, the fare of New York city subway(MTA) is all the same {{no matter how long}} do you travel, it's all 2.75 USD. It's justice of Housing inequality.|$|E

25|$|When {{an older}} {{individual}} is completing a task, {{such as having}} a conversation or doing work, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> their working memory to help them complete this task. As they age, their ability to multi-task seems to decline; thus after an interruption it is often more difficult for an aging individual to successfully finish the task at hand. Additionally, working memory {{plays a role in}} the comprehension and production of speech. There is often a decline in sentence comprehension and sentence production as individuals age. Rather than linking this decline directly to deficits in linguistic ability, it is actually deficits in working memory that contribute to these decreasing language skills.|$|E
