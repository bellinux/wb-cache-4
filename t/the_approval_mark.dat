Some of these are legal in the country they are {{manufactured}} in, but do not meet BS 1363 - these can be brought into the UK by unsuspecting travellers, or people purchasing electrical goods online. They can also be purchased through many UK electrical component distributors. There are also counterfeit plugs which appear to meet the standards (and are marked as such) but do not in fact comply. Legislation was introduced, with the last revision in 1994, to require plugs sold to meet the technical standard.

40|$|European {{approval}} for Roche’s Pegasys personalises {{treatment for a}} subgroup of hepatitis C patients: chance for cure with only four months of treatment Roche also announces start of NCORE study to determine best length of treatment in patients who do not experience a rapid response Roche announced today that the European Commission has approved a shortened, 16 -week course of treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa- 2 a (40 KD)) plus Copegus (ribavirin) for certain hepatitis C patients. The four-month treatment course will be for patients with particular strains of chronic hepatitis C (genotype 2 or 3) who have low virus levels before starting treatment, and who show a rapid virological response by clearing the virus from the blood within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This shorter treatment duration with Pegasys/Copegus will provide patients with the full benefits of therapy while reducing unnecessary drug exposure. This {{is good news for}} eligible patients as previously, all patients with genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C (HCV) received 24 weeks of Pegasys/Copegus therapy, regardless of their baseline virus levels and response while on treatment. <b>The</b> <b>approval</b> <b>marks</b> an important milestone in a new treatment concept in hepatitis C, which is called “response-guided therapy ” and seeks to customise regimens for patients based on how well they respond to treatment. Response-guided therapy is enabled by the use of Roche's highly sensitive, real-time PCR diagnostic tests, which accurately measure the levels of virus in the patient's blood.

5000|$|The {{antisense}} field {{anticipated that}} <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> of fomivirsen <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning of a}} new age of antisense drug treatments, that would be similar to the uptake of monoclonal antibody therapy, but <b>the</b> next FDA <b>approval</b> of an antisense drug came in 2013. [...] Part of what held up Isis and other companies in the field, was the way that the oligomers were chemically treated to make them into drugs which prevented some hydrolysis but also reduced affinity to the antisense molecules' targets; around 2004 the field was shifting to second generation modifications. [...] Clinical trials of antisense therapeutics by Isis and others in the early 2000s were also plagued by lack of efficacy and immune reactions to drug candidates. Isis had to cut its workforce by 40% in 2005 due to weak sales of fomivirsen and lack of confidence by the market in antisense technology.|$|R
50|$|The Woman’s Condom, {{developed}} by PATH, through a user-centered design process, {{is a new}} female contraceptive designed for improved acceptability, ease of use, and good sensation. The Woman’s Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>approval</b> was based on a clinical trial of 149 patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient cancers who enrolled on one of five single-arm trials. Ninety patients had colorectal cancer, and 59 patients had one of 14 other cancer types. The objective response rate for all patients was 39.6%. Response rates were similar across all cancer types, including 36% in colorectal cancer and 46% across the other tumor types. Notably, there were 11 complete responses, with the remainder partial responses. Responses lasted for at least six months in 78% of responders. [...] Because the clinical trial was fairly small, Merck was obligated to conduct further post-marketing studies to ensure that the results are valid.|$|R
40|$|Purpose In {{medical schools}} small {{specialties}} like clinical pharmacology may be integrated in courses covering larger specialties and examined concomitantly. The {{results of a}} pilot study suggested that this approach would have negative consequences on the knowledge gained in clinical pharmacology with integration of this speciality {{in the course of}} internal medicine and concomitant examination. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess in more detail whether students’ presumed tendency to study selectively influences <b>approval</b> (<b>the</b> pass <b>mark),</b> a surrogate marker of the knowledge gained. Methods A written examination for the integrated course in clinical pharmacology and internal medicine in Gothenburg, Sweden, was specifically designed in 2008 to evaluate the research question. The examination consisted of 50 short answer questions, of which five focused on clinical pharmacology (maximum score 10) and 45 were on internal medicine (maximum score 90). The cut-off level for <b>approval</b> (pass <b>mark)</b> was 60 %. Results Of the 81 students who wrote the examination, 73 (90. 1 %) passed the examination as a whole. When the questions in clinical pharmacology were assessed separately, 62 (76. 5 %) students passed the cut-off level of 60 %; the corresponding proportion of students achieving the cut-off level for questions on internal medicine was 90. 1 %. There was a significant correlation between the results of the two specialties (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), but the questions on clinical pharmacology generated lower scores (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The correlation coefficient between the results of two randomly chosen questions for clinical pharmacology was greater than that of two randomly chosen questions in internal medicine (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusions Our results confirm that a small specialty like clinical pharmacology may need to be examined separately in order to guarantee a sufficient level of knowledge among students...|$|R

This article examines <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system as envisaged under the Directive. The aim is two-fold. First, the article conceptualises <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system as a regulatory instrument.

Proceeding on the premise that in order to justify <b>the</b> prior <b>approval,</b> <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system must not only improve upon the quality of disclosure but that this improvement must matter if considered {{from the perspective of the}} recipient of the approved prospectus, the benefits and costs of <b>the</b> prior <b>approval</b> will be assessed for investors and issuers.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] History. This thesis examines how a complicated mix of factors converged to influence the planning, proposal, protest, and final route of the Mark Twain Expressway through St. Louis's North Side in the 1950 s. To proponents, the expressway symbolized the economic stabilization of the central business district, expansion of industry, and a brighter future for St. Louis at a time when white middle-class Americans were increasingly leaving the somewhat declining city for the suburbs. For opponents, the expressway represented yet another example of downtown leaders working to the detriment of their neighborhoods, and they fought to change its route vigorously. Of the many factors that influenced the debate, three played prominent roles. First, the historical fragmentation of the city put downtown and outlying areas at odds on nearly every political issue, especially civic projects. Second, implicit racism, often hidden by euphemisms such as "blight," was used to justify the need for expressway, {{while at the same time}} it intensified anti-expressway rhetoric expressed by people who feared the racial turnover of their particular North Side neighborhood. Third, a growing nationwide consensus that held economic growth, automobile usage, and homeownership in the high regard fueled <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> Twain Expressway under the banner of progress. Expressway proponents, such as Mayor Raymond Tucker, shrewdly used that term to control the debate and neutralize the opposition coming from the North Side...|$|R
