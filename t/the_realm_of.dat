In the chapter, she encounters Mickey Mouse, who attempts to help her escape, but she ultimately sacrifices herself once again to protect Riku from the Heartless just after Sora's climactic battle with Ansem, and so remains in <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Darkness.|$|E

5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Reality and <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves deep into <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> quantum physics, {{but it can}} be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel.

The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E

Ansem assures that Sora is now awake, and gives Riku his research data he had left in Sora's heart to help Sora save those connected to his heart.

A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E
