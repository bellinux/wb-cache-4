50|$|In Hindi, nouns have gender—they {{are either}} {{masculine}} or feminine. Both {{masculine and feminine}} nouns are divided further into two categories. For masculine nouns, there are nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -a and nouns <b>that</b> don't <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -a. Those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -a are considered marked, while those that don't are unmarked. Similarly, for feminine nouns there are those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -i {{and those that do}} not. All feminine nouns <b>that</b> don't <b>end</b> <b>in</b> the vowel -i are unmarked. These all have different declension (or inflectional morphology based on their gender, plurality, and case).|$|R
50|$|Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -ius, {{instead of}} the {{expected}} -ie end with -ī. Thus, Julius becomes Julī and filius becomes filī. The shortening does not shift the accent so the vocative of Vergilius is Vergilī, with accent on the second syllable {{even though it is}} short. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -aius and -eius have vocatives <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -aī or -eī even though the i in the nominative is consonantal.|$|R

5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} after the Test series came against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England eleven; for this tour, Bradman insisted {{that no more}} than six current Test players be allowed to represent for the hosts. The Australian skipper then fielded a full-strength team. Miller returned for this match, held at Scarborough, but did little, scoring one in his only innings and bowling eight overs without success in a match <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> a rain-affected draw.|$|E

50|$|Kannada {{has four}} declensions, {{or groups of}} case-terminations. The first declension {{includes}} all masculine and feminine nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> 'ಅ'; the second declension includes all neuter nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> 'ಅ'; the third declension includes all nouns of all genders <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> 'ಇ', 'ಈ', 'ಎ', 'ಏ', or 'ಐ'; the fourth declension includes all nouns of all genders <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> 'ಉ', ಊ', 'ಋ', 'ೠ', 'ಓ', or 'ಔ'.Below are the 'standard' case-terminations, which are suffixed to the plural number markers to create the full case-termination in the plural. However, in the singular number, all the declensions use variations of the 'standard' case-terminations as the final case-terminations.|$|R

5|$|In 2008, sports channel ESPN won {{the right}} to {{broadcast}} Bowl Championship Series games between 2011 and 2014. In compensation, it agreed to pay the BCS $125million per year, more than a competing bid from Fox ($100million), which had been paying $82.5million per year for the contract <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> 2010. To balance the higher cost of broadcasting the games, ESPN demanded more money for title sponsorship of each game. Shipping company FedEx, which had become the Orange Bowl's title sponsor in 1990 and was the longest continuous sponsor of any bowl game, balked at ESPN's increased demands—about $20million per year and required advertising outside the Orange Bowl—and ended its sponsorship.|$|E

Any number <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> '4' means <b>that</b> the player that is furthest away from the ball handler, attacks the ball handler.|$|R
5000|$|In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is {{expressed}} by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun, much {{like in the}} Scandinavian languages or Romanian (indefinite: човек, person; definite: човекът, [...] "the person") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: добър човек, a good person; definite: добрият човек, [...] "the good person"). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the nouns <b>ending</b> <b>in</b> the singular. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> a consonant and are masculine use -ът/-ят, when they are grammatical subjects, and -а/-я elsewhere. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -а/-я (most of which are feminine, too) use -та. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -е/-о use -то.|$|R
50|$|Most {{feminine}} nouns <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -η -i, -α -a and -ος -os. Those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -i {{and many}} <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -a {{stem from the}} ancient first declension and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural. The rest of those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -a originate from the ancient third declension and have formed their nominative singular from the ancient accusative singular; those nouns keep the accent unchanged in genitive plural. The nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -os are identical to the respective masculine nouns. Finally, many feminine nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> -η (-i) correspond to Ancient Greek nouns in -ις (-is), which are still used as learned forms in formal contexts. Their singular forms have been adapted {{to the rest of}} the feminine nouns, while their plural forms have retained the ancient pattern in -εις (-eis). The forms of the genitive singular -εως (-eos) are also found as a stylistic variant and they are fully acceptable, and in fact are more commonly used than the old-style nominative singular form.|$|R
5|$|The Human Genome Project—the largest, {{most costly}} single {{biological}} study ever undertaken—began in 1988 {{under the leadership}} of James D. Watson, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Shotgun sequencing and gene discovery methods pioneered by Craig Venter—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with Celera Genomics— led to a public–private sequencing competition <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome was}} {{unacceptable}} for the rebellious barons, and {{war between the}} two parties broke out almost immediately after the announcement of the settlement. After a victory at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, Montfort took over control of government, but the success was short-lived. Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E

5|$|The works around Vicksburg are now {{maintained}} by the National Park Service as part of Vicksburg National Military Park. The park, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Delta, Louisiana (flanking the Mississippi River), also commemorates the greater Vicksburg Campaign which {{led up to the}} battle.

Victory here and at Port Hudson, farther south in Louisiana, gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the classic}} {{era of the}} series <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> 1989, the plan with the new series was to have each episode as a {{standalone}} story, with no serials. Of the thirteen episodes in the series, seven of them followed this format; the remaining six were grouped together into three two-part stories. Also, {{for the first time}} since The Gunfighters in the third season, each episode was given an individual title, which was the case with the standalone and two-part stories.|$|E
5|$|After King Richard {{went to the}} Holy Land on the Third Crusade, Nonant {{supported}} the efforts of Prince John, King Richard's brother, to seize power in England. Nonant joined with John in trying to wrest control of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham from William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who had been named justiciar and chancellor during Richard's absence. It was probably Nonant that {{was responsible for the}} meeting at Loddon Bridge on 5 October 1191 <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> the deposition of Longchamp from office. Nonant supported John's side throughout the time that Richard was on Crusade and in captivity, and was tried with John after Richard's return to England in 1194. Nonant was only restored to royal favour in 1195 after the payment of a fine of 5000 marks. The bishop lost his three sheriffdoms, and retired to Normandy.|$|E

To consolidate support for his rule, Andrianampoinimerina mobilized representatives of the numerous noble castes to participate in the most extensive effort yet to expand and fortify Ambohimanga. He ordered the construction of new city walls, gates and defensive trenches, as well as a rosewood palace called Mahandrihono, which he had built in the traditional style.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Cannon was {{selected}} as the first overall pick the 1960 NFL Draft and as a first-round territorial pick in the 1960 American Football League draft, resulting in a contract dispute <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>in</b> court. Cannon played in the AFL for the Houston Oilers and Oakland Raiders before ending his football career with the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL. He began his professional career as a halfback for the Oilers. A two-time AFL All-Star, Cannon led the league in rushing and all-purpose yards in 1961.
