2500|$|The group {{arrive at}} the cyclops' lair, but instead of a terrifying monster, they find a decadent {{creature}} named [...] "Cy" [...] (Jonathan Slinger) who wears bikini briefs and offers the fighters snacks and mojitos in his hot tub. Cy insists his bloodthirsty father {{was the one who}} stole the diamond, but that he did not approve of his father and would let the group have the diamond. Kröd agrees to some quick cocktails (despite Zezelryck's bad feeling about the whole thing), and they all play a game of Truth or Dare? in the hot tub, where Cy admits he is a bisexual cyclops, or [...] "biclops", and Aneka admits she has had sex with a troll [...] (prompting an angry Kröd to ask if there is anywhere she draws the line). When Kröd insists it's time to leave, Cy pulls a switch and traps the freedom fighters in a cage, where he plans to 'sex them to death' and make more furniture for his cave from their skeletons. However, Aneka distracts Cy by getting intimate with Kröd long enough for him to retrieve a <b>throwing</b> <b>star</b> from her underwear, and Kröd throws it into Cy's forehead.|$|E

50|$|Even fully {{passive network}} taps {{introduce}} new points of failure into the network. There {{are several ways}} that taps can cause problems, and this should be considered when creating a tap architecture. Consider non-powered taps for optical-only environments or <b>throwing</b> <b>star</b> network tap for copper 100BT. This allows you to modify the intelligent aggregation taps that may be in use and avoids any complications when upgrading from 100 megabit to gigabit to 10 gigabit. Redundant power supplies are highly recommended.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is entirely}} local {{multiplayer}} and each player controls their own anthropomorphic bird samurai character. The world is purely made {{of black and}} white parts, allowing characters to hide in plain sight due to their solid black and white colors. Players can also throw a single <b>throwing</b> <b>star</b> (which colors the enemy and makes them visible), and also air dash. One hit by the player's kendo stick results in the enemy character's death, similar to Bushido Blade. By pressing L2, the character's eyes can be squinted or closed to prevent screen-watching.|$|E
50|$|When Captain America {{repeatedly}} refuses his {{challenges to}} a fight, Super-Patriot attacks him. Although Captain America {{proves to be}} a more skilled fighter and lands blow after blow, Walker manages to absorb the attacks.

In the United States, the cars instead received [...] "BMW Motorsport" [...] writing on the doorhandles.|$|E

Joe is {{discovered}} by the ninjas-for-hire, but escapes {{with the aid of}} Ortega's servant Shinyuki (John Fujioka). Joe returns to the base, where he is promptly arrested by military police who think he is fencing the arms. Jackson realizes that Joe has been set up, but his protests are wasted on Rinaldo. The Black Star Master infiltrates the stockade that night, slaughters the on-duty MPs and then tries to slaughter Joe as well. But Joe's would-be-assassin is thwarted by the sudden arrival of MP reinforcements, none of whom see the Black Star Master fleeing the scene. One of the dead MPs is found with a <b>throwing</b> <b>star</b> lodged in his head, which further implicates Joe in the bizarre goings-on.|$|E

Camero returns and again fights Hel. After she beats Hel to the ground, Camero assumes she is dead and moves to kill Trixie.

Before she can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs, who managed to survive the explosion. However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden <b>throwing</b> <b>star.</b> Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack. Trixie then reveals that she, in fact, is Pinky, and concocted the entire plot to retrieve the sword she took from Gage's bunker, which he had taken from her six months previously.|$|E

5000|$|The {{middle section}} {{of the film is}} devoted to [...] "The Bruce Lee Story," [...] a chronicle of Bruce Lee's early years in China, where he is {{depicted}} as being [...] "karate crazy," [...] much to the dismay of his parents. The footage from this {{section of the}} story is from the 1957 Bruce Lee film Thunderstorm, which has also been redubbed. This act of the presentation purports that Lee was learning karate {{to live up to the}} legacy of his great grandfather, who was [...] "one of China's greatest Samurai masters" [...] (an anachronism as China did not actually have Samurai, these were in fact Japanese warriors). The life of Lee's grandfather is also portrayed in this act at alternating points, in scenes lifted from Invincible Super Chan. Later, Lee leaves home and lands a career as an actor. This segues into a scene of Bill Louie, dressed as Kato from The Green Hornet, saving two female joggers from being raped by a gang near the World War II memorial in Battery Park in broad daylight. This segment ends after Louie apparently murders the last conscious gang member with a <b>throwing</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{is presumed}} that a statute will be {{interpreted}} {{so as to}} be internally consistent. A particular section of the statute shall not be divorced {{from the rest of the}} act. The ejusdem generis (or eiusdem generis, Latin for [...] "of the same kind") rule applies to resolve the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear. The rule results that where [...] "general words follow enumerations of particular classes or persons or things, the general words shall be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or kind as those enumerated." [...] Thus, in a statute forbidding the concealment on one's person of [...] "pistols, revolvers, derringers, or other dangerous weapons," [...] the term [...] "dangerous weapons" [...] may be construed to comprehend only dangerous weapons of the kind enumerated; i.e., firearms, or perhaps more narrowly still, handguns. A hypothetical court may have to determine whether a sword, a taser, or a Japanese <b>throwing</b> <b>star</b> would be properly included in the [...] "other" [...] category of the statute. Here, the term [...] "other dangerous weapons" [...] must be given a meaning of the [...] "same kind" [...] as the word of established meaning.|$|E

It {{is a combination}} of two colossal monsters fused together by Barao named Ondera and Shigidira.|$|R
5000|$|In the game, {{the player}} goes through five levels, using <b>throwing</b> <b>stars</b> and special ninjutsu {{abilities}} called the [...] "ninja arts", {{to stop a}} gang and the evil mastermind behind a slew of kidnappings, El Toro. One of the kidnapped is {{a student of the}} Black Manta's sensei, Taro.|$|R
50|$|Against Batman's orders, Damian {{leaves the}} Batcave and, after a chase {{and a long}} fight, defeats Ubu, whom he located by {{accessing}} the Bat-Computer. Before Damian can kill him, Nightwing arrives, mistakes him for a criminal and subdues him before bringing {{him back to the}} Batcave. Batman berates Damian for his recklessness, willingness to kill and exposing their operation. Batman then has Damian don the mantle of Robin to teach him discipline. Searching for a lead on Langstrom's location, Batman goes to Arkham to interrogate a rabid Killer Croc, who supplied the mutagens to Langstrom in exchange for his enhancements and is currently going through drastic, agonizing withdrawal symptoms that cause him to shed his scales and tail. Since others are too afraid of him to medicate him without being harmed, Batman promises Croc help in exchange for information. Batman follows Croc's lead about the formula's mutagen to Langstrom's apartment, where he finds a <b>throwing</b> <b>star</b> that he takes evidence of Deathstroke's involvement. Before he leaves, he goes throughout the building and finds a storage room filled with caged bats, with one larger cage being empty and broken open from inside. Batman then finds a rabid gorilla with bat like mutations, one of Langstrom's unstable subjects, and it attacks him until it dies from its mutations. A drone aircraft sent by Deathstroke then flies past and crashes on the building, destroying it, though Batman evades the explosion. Commissioner Gordon warns them about an abandoned stadium believed to house Deathstroke's men.|$|E

The major varieties of shuriken are the bō shuriken (棒手裏剣, stick shuriken) and the hira shuriken (平手裏剣, flat shuriken) or shaken (車剣, also read as kurumaken, wheel shuriken).|$|R

50|$|Bandit {{carries a}} {{specialized}} wrist mounted crossbow, that fires wire-tethered quarrels tipped with miniature grappling barbs which would penetrate an opponent's flesh and then open up beneath the skin. He then uses his powers {{to send a}} debilitating bio-electric charge along the electrically conductive tether, basically making himself a living taser. He also carries a variety of <b>throwing</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R
