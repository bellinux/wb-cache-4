5|$|On December 7, 2012, Variety {{announced}} {{the development of}} a sequel to Alice in Wonderland. Linda Woolverton returned to write a screenplay. On May 31, 2013, James Bobin began talks to direct the sequel under the working title Alice in Wonderland: Into the Looking Glass. Johnny Depp returned as The Hatter, Mia Wasikowska reprised the role of Alice, and Helena Bonham Carter returned as the Red Queen. Several other cast-members from the 2010 film also reprised their roles in the sequel. On November 22, 2013, it was announced that the sequel will be released on May 27, 2016 and that Bobin would direct the film. Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen are featured in the film. On January 21, 2014, the film was again retitled to Alice in Wonderland: <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass.</b> The title was later reworked once again to Alice <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass.</b>|$|E

5000|$|When Alice first {{sees the}} White King, having passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eponymous <b>looking</b> <b>glass,</b> he is a chesspiece of normal size, but animate, and, for {{whatever}} reason, cannot hear or see Alice at this stage. Alice, not realising this, picks both {{him and the}} White Queen {{off the floor and}} places them on a table, leading them to believe that some unseen volcano blew them up there. Afterwards, however, she has some mischievous fun by manipulating the King's handwriting from behind while he writes so that he comes out with nonsense in his memorandum book ("the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly"). She soon leaves him alone, however, when she sees the poetry-book in which [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] is written.|$|R

5|$|Hathaway's biggest {{commercial}} success came in 2012 with Christopher Nolan's superhero film The Dark Knight Rises, which grossed over $1 billion worldwide. Her {{portrayal of the}} DC anti-heroine Selina Kyle in the film received considerable praise and won her the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. The same year, her performance as Fantine in Tom Hooper's epic musical Les Misérables garnered her widespread acclaim and won her the Golden Globe, SAG Award, BAFTA Award and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2014, she starred as a NASA scientist in Nolan's Interstellar, which garnered her a Saturn Award for Best Actress nomination. She earned a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance nomination {{for the role of}} a fighter pilot in Grounded (2015). She later starred in films such as The Intern (2015), Alice <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> (2016) and Colossal (2017).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{relationships}} among Chinese college students’ attitudes toward online games and online game advertising, their perceived influence of online game advertising on themselves and others, and their attitude toward restrictions on online game advertising. The growing popularity of online games and the frequent use of advertising in promoting online gaming activities make it necessary to examine empirically the relationships among these variables. Based on a survey among 518 Chinese college students, the study found support for the mediating role of the third-person effect.

60|$|The snake-house came next, and I went in, {{on my way}} {{to visit}} the {{rhinoceros}} family. I rather like snakes, since I had a tame green one, who lived under the door-step, and would come out and play with me on sunny days. These snakes I found very interesting, only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out, and I wasn't allowed to poke them; so I missed seeing several of the most curious. An ugly cobra laid and blinked at me <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>looking</b> quite as dangerous as he was. There were big and little snakes,--black, brown, and speckled, lively and lazy, pretty and plain ones,--but I liked the great boa best.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first part}} of the song, [...] "Your Move", alludes to the game of chess as a metaphor for male-female relationships. Examples include the phrases [...] "move me onto any black square", [...] "make the white queen run so fast", and [...] "the goal is for us all to capture only one". It can be {{attributed}} to Lewis Carroll's novel <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> Looking-Glass. In <b>looking</b> <b>glass</b> land {{if you want to be}} [...] "satisfied" [...] and [...] "on your way" [...] you must walk backwards on life's chessboard to move ahead. That is [...] "don't surround yourself with yourself" [...] is a chess analogy. This is opposite of what we were taught: fight with might and force to get ahead.|$|R

40|$|Drugs, {{guns and}} crime all rank {{high on the}} public agenda of social concerns. About 60 percent of all homicides and suicides are {{committed}} with guns, as are {{a third of all}} robberies, and a fifth of aggrevated assaults. In all, guns are used in about 800 000 violent crimes each year. Further, roughly 35 000 Americans are killed each year {{as a consequence of the}} homicidal, accidental and suicidal use 1 of guns. While the connection between gun availability and crime is certainly not lost on members of the community in general, it is interesting to note that the prescriptive policy solutions vary drastically contingent on the particular lobby group proffering answers. We certainly do not contend any deeper knowledge or understanding of these complicated issues, at a sociological level, than the authors of the copious and diverse existing literature, but it may be instructive to analyze the public policy implications of such ideas as gun control and legalizing drugs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> economist’s <b>looking</b> <b>glass.</b> Most of us have an opinion, and freely offer it at dinner parties, on the merits or problems with such policy prescriptions as legalizing drugs, or greater gun controls. What was puzzling to us is the realization that we both support the legalization of drugs and making the ownership of guns far les...|$|R
5000|$|When Alice {{meets the}} Red Queen and joins the chess game, {{she takes the}} place of a white pawn, Lily being too young to play. She does not meet the White Queen as a human-sized {{character}} until the Fifth Square. The White Queen lives backwards in time, {{due to the fact that}} she lives <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eponymous <b>looking</b> <b>glass.</b> Her behaviour is odd to Alice. She offers Alice [...] "jam to-morrow and jam yesterday - but never jam to-day." [...] She screams in pain until, rather than because, she pricks her thumb on her brooch, and tells Alice of the King's messenger who has been imprisoned for a crime he will later be tried for and perhaps (but not definitely) commit in the end. The White Queen, aside from telling Alice things that she finds difficult to believe (one being that she is just over 101 years old) says that in her youth she could believe [...] "six impossible things before breakfast" [...] and counsels Alice to practice the same skill. The meeting ends with the Queen seeming to turn into a bespectacled sheep who sits at a counter in a shop as Alice passes into the next square on the board. The Sheep is somewhat different from the Queen in terms of personality and gets [...] "more like a porcupine every time Alice looks at her" [...] because she knits with several knitting needles all at once. Two of these needles turn into oars when Alice appears in a boat, and then reappear in the Sheep's shop, where Alice purchases an egg, which becomes Humpty Dumpty as she moves to the next square.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} they {{embarked}} again, and were soon riding pertly over the waves of the bay. All {{of a sudden the}} captain started to his feet--the boat spun round, and again made for the shore. Some twenty or thirty natives armed with spears which <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>looked</b> like reeds, had just come out of the grove, and were apparently shouting to the strangers not to be in such a hurry, but return and be sociable. But they were somewhat distrusted, for the boat paused about its length from the beach, when the captain standing up in its head delivered an address in pantomime, the object of which seemed to be, that the islanders should draw near. One of them stepped forward and made answer, seemingly again urging the strangers not to be diffident, but beach their boat. The captain declined, tossing his arms about in another pantomime. In the end he said something which made them shake their spears; whereupon he fired a pistol among them, which set the whole party running; while one poor little fellow, dropping his spear and clapping his hand behind him, limped away in a manner which almost made me itch to get a shot at his assailant.|$|R
25|$|He {{played a}} gangster in Once a Thief (1965) with Alain Delon.

25|$|Anne Jacqueline Hathaway (born November 12, 1982) is an American {{actress and}} singer. Her {{breakthrough}} debut film role was as Mia Thermopolis in the Disney comedy The Princess Diaries (2001).

25|$|Windsor {{began her}} career {{on stage in}} 1950 {{at the age of}} 13 and made her film debut in The Belles of St Trinian's (1954). She {{received}} a BAFTA Award nomination for the film Sparrows Can't Sing (1963), and a Tony Award nomination for the 1964 Broadway production of Oh, What A Lovely War!. In 1972, she starred opposite Vanessa Redgrave in the West End production of The Threepenny Opera.

25|$|Modern maps of Oz {{are almost}} universally drawn with the Winkies {{in the west}} and the Munchkins in the east, {{although}} west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> <b>glass</b> in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book The Number of the Beast he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's The Magic Mirror of Oz attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> <b>glass</b> self {{conceptualization}} of the social self is critically incomplete in that it overlooks the divergent roles of ingroups and outgroups in self-definition. That is, it has been demonstrated that while individuals will converge upon the attitudes and behaviours of ingroup members, they will also diverge from the attitudes and behaviours of outgroup members. The neglect of the latter scenario is attributed to <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> <b>glass</b> approaches’ implicit focus on ingroup member appraisals. This alternative perspective is derived from the self-categorization theory analysis of social influence. Indeed, it is further argued that <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> <b>glass</b> self metaphor fails to reflect the fact that influence derives from the self-categorization of other individuals as part of the self. In other words, people are not shaped by the reflections from ‘others’, but rather are shaped by the creation of a collective social identity that contrasts ‘us’ against relevant ‘others’.|$|R

500|$|Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil {{reviewed}} the series positively, with Yuki's art, characterization, and storytelling {{a source of}} praise. She, however, expressed her feelings of annoyance and frustration with {{the conclusion of the}} fourth volume, which saw the female characters left behind on purpose by the male members of the orchestra and then Eles' kidnapping by Berthier. She also wrote that Yuki's inclusion of a happy ending felt surprising compared {{to the rest of the}} story. Reviewing [...] "Camelot Garden", she enjoyed it less than Grand Guignol Orchestra, and wrote that the short story contained an implicit reference to Lewis Carroll's children's novel <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> (1871) and its character, the ever-sleeping Red King.|$|E
500|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, Alice's {{continuing}} appeal has {{been attributed to}} her ability to be continuously re-imagined. [...] In Men in Wonderland, Catherine Robson writes that, [...] "In all her different and associated forms—underground and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> <b>glass,</b> textual and visual, drawn and photographed, as Carroll's brunette or Tenniel's blonde or Disney's prim miss, as the real Alice Liddell [...] Alice is the ultimate cultural icon, available for any and every form of manipulation, and as ubiquitous today as in the era of her first appearance." [...] Robert Douglass-Fairhurst compares Alice's cultural status to [...] "something more like a modern myth," [...] suggesting her ability to act as an empty canvas for [...] "abstract hopes and fears" [...] allows for further [...] "meanings" [...] to be ascribed to the character. Zoe Jacques and Eugene Giddens suggest that the character occupies a status within pop culture where [...] "Alice in a blue dress is as ubiquitous as Hamlet holding a skull," [...] which creates [...] "the strange position whereby the public 'knows' Alice without having read either Wonderland or Looking-Glass." [...] They argue that this allows for creative freedom in subsequent adaptations, in that faithfulness to the texts can be overlooked.|$|E
500|$|The rhyme {{has also}} {{been used as a}} {{reference}} in more serious literary works, including as a recurring motif of the Fall of Man in James Joyce's 1939 novel Finnegans Wake. Robert Penn Warren's 1946 American novel All the King's Men is the story of populist politician [...] Willie Stark's rise to the position of governor and eventual fall, based on the career of the corrupt Louisiana Senator Huey Long. It won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize and was twice made into a film All the King's Men in 1949 and 2006, the former winning the Academy Award for best motion picture. This was echoed in Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward's book All the President's Men, about the Watergate scandal, referring to the failure of the President's staff to repair the damage once the scandal had leaked out. It was filmed as All the President's Men in 1976, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Similarly, Humpty Dumpty is referred to in Paul Auster's 1985 novel City of Glass, when two characters discuss him as [...] "the purest embodiment of the human condition" [...] and quote extensively from <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass.</b> Luis d'Antin van Rooten's 1967 book Mots d'Heures, a collection of homophonically translated poetry, includes a version of the rhyme in nonsensical French text, beginning [...] "Un petit d'un petit, S'étonne aux Halles...".|$|E
