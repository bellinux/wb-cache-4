This method is preferred by most end-users, because it eliminates the need to carry ID cards or use PINs.

5000|$|New {{media is}} the concept that new methods of {{communicating}} in the digital world allow smaller groups of people to congregate online and share, sell and swap goods and information. It also allows more people {{to have a voice}} in their community and in the world in general. The most important structural characteristic of new media is the integration of telecommunications technologies. The second structural new media characteristic of the current communications revolution is the rise of interactive media. Interactivity is a sequence of action and reaction.

These result in low of productivity, quality, and competitiveness. Accordingly, an evaluation on self condition and their environment {{in relation to}} decision making process towards snack small and medium enterprises development policy through performance measurement and improvement is required. Balanced Scorecard was used in measuring firm performances. OWA Operator was performed in assigning key performance indicators (KPI or IKK). Perspective weight, KPI, and target were assigned using Fuzzy AHP. Steps of performance improvement was developed on three submodels: (1) submodel of identification of customers 2 ̆ 7 needs and <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> (2) submodel of assigning importance weight of customers needs, correlations among <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and value of relationship between customers importance and <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and (3) submodel of assigning priority and recommendation for performance improvement.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} on {{the determination}} of important parameters and <b>technical</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{for the development of}} a welding fumes index by using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach. Welding fumes index is developed with the objective to enhance the welding workplace safety and health. Index simplifies complex health-hazard issues of welding fumes to be comprehended easily by the employees. Questionnaires on welder desire to know the various welding fumes health effects that exist in their workplace were distributed among welders of a selected automotive assembly lines in the state Pahang, Malaysia, during a pilot case study. Results of the questionnaires show that all the customer requirements (irritants effect, sensitizer effects, respiratory system effect, systemic toxin effect, reproductive toxins effect, carcinogen effect, mixture effect) were equally important to the welders. The relationship between the customer (welder) requirement and <b>technical</b> <b>characteristic</b> were established whereby important technical characteristics were shortlisted. Development of welding fumes index according to employees demand will increase the knowledge and awareness on occupational safety and health among employees.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to question the interpretation of the usually-found positive correlation between firm-specific pay inequalities and productivity. We estimate from French employer-employee matched data this correlation and confirm that it is positive, even after accounting for fixed unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity using instrumental variables. This result is consistent with the idea that wage inequality is one of the tools that are available to stimulate workers productivity. However, in such a framework, pay inequality is an optimization variable controlled by the firm, and should therefore appear as endogenous. This is not the case: tests show that variations in pay inequality are exogenous, i. e. they are imposed to the firm in a way that is uncorrelated to other unobserved determinants of productivity. We therefore adapt the standard model of incentive theory to make it compatible with this exogeneity property, along the lines of Lazear (1989). The model that we develop is a model where the choice of a higher or lower degree of pay inequality is fully constrained by an exogenous <b>technical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the firm, i. e. the varying importance of collective and individual effort in its production function. In such a context, the degree of pay inequality is interpreted as an indirect measure of this <b>technical</b> <b>characteristic.</b> We confirm this interpretation by examining the relationship between pay inequality and organizational characteristics of firms measured by the REPONSE survey.
