60|$|The {{girl from}} Winnipeg saw the morning frost lie {{white on the}} long grass at the lake edges, and watched the haze of mellow golden birch leaves as they dropped. 'Now that's the way trees ought to turn,' she said. 'Don't you think our Eastern maple is a little violent in colour?' Then we passed through a country where for many hours the talk in <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> was <b>of</b> <b>mines</b> and <b>the</b> {{treatment}} of ores. Men told one tales--prospectors' yarns of the sort one used to hear vaguely before Klondike or Nome were public property. They did not care whether one believed or doubted. They, too, were only {{at the beginning of}} things--silver perhaps, gold perhaps, nickel perhaps. If a great city did not arise at such a place--the very name was new since my day--it would assuredly be born within a few miles of it. The silent men boarded <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> and dropped off, and disappeared beyond thickets and hills precisely as the first widely spaced line of skirmishers fans out and vanishes along the front of the day's battle.|$|R
40|$|The South African {{government}} {{introduced the}} Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) as an intervention to resolve economic imbalances. In furthering inclusivity in the previously exclusive sectors, like Mining, the BEE legislations and Mining Charter {{were introduced to}} benefit the HDSA. The study addressed a significant gap in BEE research, which is important within the South African context, as the country currently reviews progress after the initial 20 years of democratic dispensation. The research examined the share price performance <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> stocks listed on the JSE by tracking their share price performance after announcements relating to black empowerment transactions. The objectives of the research were to, first, determine whether announcements of BEE transactions lead to better shareholder wealth creation in the South African mining sector, second, to determine {{the impact of these}} announcements on Old and BEE mining companies that were listed on the JSE post- 1994, third, to determine whether the early BEE announcements made before the release of the Mining Charter in September 2010 had a greater positive impact on the Cumulative Abnormal Returns (<b>CARs)</b> <b>of</b> Mining companies compared to those made after the amendment to legislation. The research employed an event study methodology to analyse a sample <b>of</b> 26 <b>mining</b> companies that made a total of 241 qualifying announcements from January 2000 to November 2014. The results of the study showed negative impact on <b>the</b> <b>CARs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> companies. It was noted that the old mining companies that existed before 1994 had better average abnormal return than the BEE companies. Further, the results showed that the Average Abnormal Returns (AARs) of the BEE announcements made prior to the Mining Charter had greater AARs than those made after the implementation. In sum, the BEE announcements had largely a negative impact on share performance <b>of</b> the <b>mining</b> companies.

40|$|This research, {{comprised}} of three essays, considered {{the evolution of}} Canada 2 ̆ 7 s population <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> firms {{over much of the}} 2 oth century, the resource characteristics of the firms that survived the industry shakeout, and the strategic positioning of the firms that ranked among the largest mining firms in the world. In the first essay, the forces responsible for the change in the number <b>of</b> Canadian <b>mining</b> firms between 1929 and 1999 were explored using a set of mathematical models designed to identify the underlying dynamic. Density, or the number <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> firms in the population, was found to be responsible for the industry 2 ̆ 7 s evolutionary profile. Organizational populations typically experience a significant decrease in membership at one point in their history. This phenomenon, known as a 2 ̆ 7 shakeout 2 ̆ 7, occurred in the 1980 s for <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> <b>Car</b> adian <b>mining</b> firms. In the second essay, the survival of a cohort of 741 firms that were active in 1969 was tracked over a thirty year period. The firms that survived were no 1 only the older firms and the firms with more financial resources but also those firms in possession of a portfolio of resourcebased assets in the form <b>of</b> deposits and <b>mines.</b> In the third essay, the strategic positioning of twenty-six of the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest <b>mining</b> firms, seven <b>of</b> which were Canadian, was examined. In an industry where little competitive or corporate strategic variety would be expected, the few firms that chose to position themselves somewhat differently than their competitors were found to outperform those who aligned themselves with the majority of firms...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR HENLEY, - I {{am sitting}} on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> with a mill party from Missouri going west for his health. Desolate flat prairie upon all hands. Here {{and there a}} herd of cattle, a yellow {{butterfly}} or two; a patch of wild sunflowers; a wooden house or two; then a wooden church alone in miles of waste; then a windmill to pump water. When we stop, which we do often, for emigrants and freight travel together, the kine first, the men after, the whole plain is heard singing with cicadae. This is a pause, as you may see from the writing. What happened to the old pedestrian emigrants, what was the tedium suffered by the Indians and trappers of our youth, the imagination trembles to conceive. This is now Saturday, 23rd, and I have been steadily travelling since I parted from you at St. Pancras. It is a strange vicissitude from the Savile Club to this; I sleep with a man from Pennsylvania {{who has been in}} the States Navy, and mess with him and the Missouri bird already alluded to. We have a tin wash-bowl among four. I wear nothing but a shirt and a pair of trousers, and never button my shirt. When I land for a meal, I pass my coat and feel dressed. [...] This life is to last till Friday, Saturday, or Sunday next. It is a strange affair to be an emigrant, as I hope you shall see in a future work. I wonder if this will be legible; my present station on the waggon roof, though airy compared to <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> is both dirty and insecure. I can see the track straight before and straight behind me to either horizon. Peace of mind I enjoy with extreme serenity; I am doing right; I know no one will think so; and don't care. My body, however, is all to whistles; I don't eat; but, man, I can sleep. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> is chock full of Chinese.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have devised}} a car," [...] he said, [...] "in which I can sit comfortably and smoke my cigar while I make the descent. This, at the easy and steady {{rate at which}} my engines would move, would occupy less than three hours. I could go a good deal faster if I wanted to, but this would be fast enough. Think of that--fourteen miles in three hours! It would be {{considered}} very slow and easy travelling on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. This <b>car</b> would be suspended by a double chain {{of the very best}} toughened steel, which would be strong enough to hold ten <b>cars</b> <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>mine.</b> The windlass would be moved by an electric engine of sufficient power to do twenty times the work I should require of it, but in order to make everything what might be called super-safe, there would be attached to <b>the</b> <b>car</b> another double chain, similar to the first, and this would be wound upon another windlass and worked by another engine, as powerful as the first one. Thus, even if one of these double chains should break--an accident almost impossible--or if anything should happen to one of these engines, there would be another engine more than sufficient for the work. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> this <b>car</b> would be conical, ending in a sharp point, and made of steel, so that if any fragment in the wall of the tunnel should become dislodged and fall, it would glance from this roof and fall between <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and <b>the</b> inner surface of the shaft; for <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is to be only twenty-six inches in diameter-quite wide enough for my purpose--and this would leave at least ten inches of space all around <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> But, as I have said before, the sides of this tunnel are hard and smooth. The substances of which they are composed have been pressed together by a tremendous force. It is as unlikely that anything should fall from them as that particles should drop from the inside of a rifle-barrel.|$|R
