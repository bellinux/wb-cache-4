The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram was painted deep red to match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E
5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata {{has been}} recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown. Off the coast, it {{has been recorded}} from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E

5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the milk}} shark is viviparous; females {{usually have a}} single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman parturition occurs year-round with a peak in spring. Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation {{for the lack of}} reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> detected (such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{this and}} several similar peer {{reviewed}} papers, {{there is not}} a consensus as to whether such devices can produce a continuous output of work.

25|$|There {{was high}} {{agreement}} and much evidence that stabilization {{could be achieved}} by 2050 using currently available technologies, provided appropriate and effective incentives {{were put in place}} for their development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion, and that barriers were removed. For stabilization at lower levels the IPCC agreed that improvements of carbon intensity need to be made much faster <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the case in the past, and {{that there would be a}} greater need for efficient public and private research, development and demonstration efforts and investment in new technologies during the next few decades. The IPCC points out that government funding in real absolute terms for most energy research programmes has been flat or declining for nearly 20 years, and is now about half the 1980 level. Delays in cutting emissions would lead to higher stabilization levels and increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts, as more of the current high-emission technologies would have been deployed.|$|E
25|$|Magic {{texts and}} amulets attest by {{name to the}} {{prevalence}} of a belief in reproductive demons in the Greco-Roman world. During the Byzantine period, textual evidence of the child-harming demon is most often found in exorcisms or demonologies. Historian of ancient religion Sarah Iles Johnston suggests that this belief is expressed more commonly in earlier literature <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noticed. The Homeric epics allude to the unmarried dead, who are excluded from the Underworld and might harm the living. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Demeter {{in her role as}} a kourotrophic ("youth-nurturing") goddess promises to protect her hosts' infant from demonic attack in language that recalls known magical incantations. Centuries later, in Augustan Rome, Ovid describes the practice of protecting doorways with buckthorn after {{the birth of a child}} to ward off striges, winged female demons who were thought to suck the blood of newborns. One of the twelve-and-a-half names of Gylo (see above) is Strigla, a form of the word strix as a kind of witch.|$|E

500|$|An {{analysis}} by Sarah Millholland and Gregory Laughlin {{indicates that the}} commensurabilities (period ratios consistent with pairs of objects in resonance with each other) of the extreme TNOs {{are most likely to}} occur if Planet Nine has a semi-major axis of 654 AU. They used 11 then-known extreme TNOs with their semi-major axis over 200, and perihelion over 30 AU , with five bodies close to four simple ratios (5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 3:2) with a 654 AU distance: , [...] (5:1), [...] (5:1), [...] (4:1), , , [...] (3:1), , , , and (90377) Sedna (3:2). Beginning with this semi-major axis they determine that Planet Nine best maintains the [...] anti-alignment of their orbits and a strong clustering of arguments of perihelion if it is near aphelion and has an eccentricity e ≈ 0.5, inclination i ≈ 30°, argument of perihelion ω ≈ 150°, and longitude of ascending node Ω ≈ 50° (the last differs from Brown and Batygin's value of 90°). The favored location of Planet Nine is a right ascension of 30° to 50° and a declination of −20° to 20°. They also note that in their simulations the clustering of arguments of perihelion is almost always smaller <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> observed.|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{wished for}} Reign in Blood {{producer}} Rick Rubin {{to produce the}} album, and expected {{him to do so}} after Rubin expressed an initial interest. Rubin was busy, however, which caused a further delay to recording. While Christ Illusions recording was finally underway Rubin lent production to Metallica's Death Magnetic, an action later described by King as a [...] "slap in the fucking face." [...] Josh Abraham produced the album instead, and was praised by Blabbermouth's Don Kaye [...] "for capturing much more of the spark <b>than</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> apparent on the last few records." [...] Despite missing an opportunity to produce Christ Illusion, Rubin contributed in an [...] "executive production" [...] capacity. King was critical of his involvement, and said he cannot recall Rubin's presence in the studio during the recording, and that Rubin's main contribution was in providing suggestions during the final mix. Jamie Thomson of UK's The Guardian newspaper was scornful of Rubin's contribution, and observed Slayer [...] "seem unwilling to ditch the nu-metal tendencies that have made much of their recent output so resistible, which suggests Rubin's involvement was considerably less hands-on than in his remarkable redemptions of Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond." ...|$|E
