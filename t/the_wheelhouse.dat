5|$|The crane {{fell into}} disuse in 1980s, {{and in the}} {{intervening}} period of neglect, the crane suffered vandalism to <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> and corrosion to the structure. In 1988 the crane was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Medstead {{contains}} {{a total of}} six Grade II listed buildings. Southdown Old Farmhouse is a small manor which dates from the 18th century and has undergone 20th century restorations and extensions; the manor was designated as a listed building on 31 May 1985. Another Grade II listed building is a Victorian wheelhouse with a donkey wheel which lies immediately southwest of Southdown Old Farmhouse. <b>The</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> was built in the early 19th century and consists of weatherboarded timber frames on brick plinths. The donkey wheel is in working order and is made of a large timber axle with a rope hanging over a well.|$|E

50|$|The North Head {{was built}} by Mort's Dock, Woolwich for the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company. Launched in 1913, it was the fifth of six Binngarra type vessels and nearly {{identical}} to the Balgowlah and Bellubera. It was named after Barrenjoey at {{the northern tip of}} Pittwater. In 1930, received its first refit which saw much of the upper deck enclosed and <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouses</b> extended.|$|R

5|$|There {{were several}} cottages on the estate, {{the first of}} which, The Beeches, was built for the Fox family. Swiss Cottage, which was built in 1819, was {{originally}} known as Carysfoot Cottage, when the Earl of Carysfort was a patient there. Lanesborough Cottage was built as accommodation for Lord Lanesborough. The lodge house was originally called <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> as it contained the mechanism used to open and close the iron gates to the asylum. A garden alcove dating from around 1820 is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse.</b> Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E

5|$|Just before dawn, Howard summoned his platoon {{commanders to}} a meeting. With their senior {{officers}} dead or wounded, numbers One, Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals. Howard's second in command, Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing. Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons {{had a full}} complement of officers and NCOs. The landings at Sword began at 07:00, preceded by a heavy naval bombardment. At the bridges, daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot. The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75mm anti-tank gun on the east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville, the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area. At 09:00, two German gunboats approached the canal bridge from Ouistreham. The lead boat fired its 20mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT, hitting <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> of the leading boat, which crashed into the canal bank. The second boat retreated to Ouistreham. A lone German aircraft bombed the canal bridge at 10:00, dropping one bomb. The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> complex {{has been}} dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC–2nd century AD profusion of these {{structures in the}} Western Isles by several centuries. Construction used the stones of the broch itself {{and two of the}} four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type. Three successive periods of construction were undertaken, and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays. One structure was built as a circular building and the radial piers were inserted afterwards. This may have been an earlier, less stable design. In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V-shaped, in another all are to the latter design, again suggesting a developing style. Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built into the earth, the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards.|$|E
25|$|The hull {{was divided}} into five {{watertight}} compartments and spaces were filled with buoyant materials which combined with a watertight GRP wheelhouse {{to give it a}} self-righting capability. A survivors' cabin was sited forward of <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> with eight seats and a stretcher could be carried in <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> which had seats for the four crew members.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, much of {{the upper}} deck was {{enclosed}} and <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouses</b> extended. In 1946, {{it was decided that}} Balgowlah and Barrenjoey would be converted to diesel power. Barrenjoey was first, and re-emerged in 1951 as North Head. However, Balgowlah was never converted, the cost of converting North Head had left the company in grave financial circumstances and it could not afford the cost of reconditioning the hull. The engines purchased for the conversion were later placed in the Baragoola. It made its last trip on the 08:05 to Manly on 27 February 1951 and was then laid up.|$|R
25|$|Anchor seiners have <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> and {{accommodation}} aft and {{the working}} deck amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and shot from the stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships.|$|E
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E
25|$|Asian seiners – In Asia, {{the seine}} netter usually has <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> forward {{and the working}} deck aft, {{in the manner of}} a stern trawler. However, in regions where the fishing effort is a labour-intensive, low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail.|$|E

25|$|To {{communicate}} with passengers and crew, a speaking trumpet was fitted to {{the rooms of}} the captain and pilot, just aft of <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse.</b> The trumpet could also be utilized as a whistle to the forecastle. Additionally, the captain was able to {{communicate with}} crew members via a set of twelve bells located {{in different parts of the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifeboat}} {{is completely}} water-tight {{allowing it to}} self-right with up to 60 people on board. The boat {{has the potential to}} carry a maximum of 120 passengers on board, but without self-righting capability. The Survivors Space has room for 10 sitting and 8 standing. The Survivors Space is accessed either through <b>the</b> <b>Wheelhouse</b> or the fore deck Emergency Escape Hatch.|$|E
25|$|Much of this {{equipment}} {{can be controlled}} from <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper's chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.|$|E
50|$|The SR.N4 was {{the largest}} {{hovercraft}} built to that date, designed to carry 254 passengers in two cabins besides a four-lane automobile bay which held up to 30 cars. Cars were driven from a bow ramp just forward of <b>the</b> cockpit / <b>wheelhouse.</b> <b>The</b> first design was 40 m long, weighed 190 LT, was capable of 83 kn and could cruise at over 60 kn.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheelhouses</b> are <b>the</b> small {{enclosed}} {{parts of}} a bridge that historically held the ship's wheel. Today, ship's bridges {{do not have a}} separate wheelhouse; <b>the</b> term <b>wheelhouse</b> or pilothouse is used nowadays to refer to the smaller bridges of small vessels, such as tugs.|$|R
50|$|The Albea was {{designed}} by the Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. It has a similar design with its South American equivalent, the Siena, but with a longer wheelbase.

25|$|Set netters – also operate gillnets. However, during fishing {{operations}} the vessel is not {{attached to the}} nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. <b>The</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Radio Mi Amigo {{moved to}} 962kHz on 1 December. Due to {{generator}} trouble, the two services {{could no longer}} be broadcast simultaneously and Radio Caroline again broadcast at night with both stations using the 50kW transmitter and Radio Caroline began to receive more mail from the continent. At times, a 10kW transmitter was used to save fuel and relieve the generators. The 10kW transmitters could run on the Henschel generator beside the two main MAN units and also a Cummins unit on the aft deck behind <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained <b>the</b> <b>wheelhouse</b> and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve {{made up of a}} skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E
5000|$|Following capture, the Stolt Valor made way to {{the pirate}} haven of Eyl on the eastern coast of Somalia. The pirates made contact with the ships owners the {{following}} day, September 16.
