2500|$|Ludlam highly enjoyed portraying Leanne {{throughout}} her first stint as {{she liked the}} extremities of Leanne's homophobia and believed it provided an interesting character to play. However upon her second stint that saw Leanne accepting towards Nicole and Maia's relationship, Ludlam believed that the character had been toned down and found portraying the character to be [...] "a lot less fun". Leanne's mispronunciation of Ula Levi's (Frankie Adams) name as [...] "Ew-la" [...] became a running joke throughout the cast and crew, with a 2015 scene showing Ula correcting her after many months, receiving much praise by the audience. Karima Madut praised the relationship between Leanne and her character fellow receptionist Clementine Dean, [...] "They are a great team, I guess Leanne is more the older, wiser woman and they develop a great relationship. My character looks {{up to her and}} she learns to not become more subdued, but she starts to become more thoughtful." [...] The character proved hugely controversial upon her debut April 2010 after several homophobic comments she made were perceived to be insulting the city of Tauranga in suggesting it was not gay friendly. The controversy surrounded Leanne telling Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton) that his shirt was [...] "too gay" [...] for Tauranga. The episode also featured Nicole referring to the city as not being as gay friendly as Auckland. Bay of Plenty Tourism general manager, Tim Burgess believed the show was establishing a [...] "negative stereotype," [...] and that the, [...] "only positive <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> is they were pronouncing Tauranga and Mauao correctly." [...] In response to the episode he referred to the writing team as [...] "disappointing and lazy." [...] Burgess also requested an apology. Matthew Denton of the University of Auckland student magazine, Craccum, named Leanne as the shows 5th most annoying character. He attributed this to her blatant homophobia and the irony of this due to her disregard for relationships after attempting to seduce married man Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain). Leanne's homophobia again drew controversy in 2017, with a stuff.co.nz columnist believing it was sending the wrong message to young watchers. Tara Strong of The Spinoff website praised Leanne and Howard's romance and compared them to Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

This statement acquires some force from the circumstance that the pages of that story--a fair half of the book--are also the product of experience. That experience belongs (like [...] "Youth's") to the time before I ever thought of putting pen to paper. As to its [...] "reality" [...] that is for the readers to determine.

But here we are approaching the veiled region of artistic values which it would be improper and indeed dangerous for me to enter. I have looked over the proofs, have corrected a misprint or two, have changed a word or two--and that's all. It is not very likely that I shall ever read The End of the Tether again.

One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> very positively about Montmorency, and one piece of advice I can give to those who visit the falls. The place from which to see them is not the horrible little wooden temple which has been built immediately over them on that side which lies nearest to Quebec. The stranger is put down at a gate through which a path leads to this temple, and at which a woman demands from him twenty-five cents for the privilege of entrance. Let him by all means pay the twenty-five cents. Why should he attempt to see the falls for nothing, seeing that this woman has a vested interest in the showing of them? I declare that if I thought that I should hinder this woman from her perquisites by what I write, I would leave it unwritten, and let my readers pursue their course to the temple--to their manifest injury. But they will pay the twenty-five cents. Then let them cross over the bridge, eschewing the temple, and wander round on the open field till they get the view of the falls, and the view of Quebec also, from the other side. It is worth the twenty-five cents and the hire of the carriage also. Immediately over the falls there was a suspension bridge, of which the supporting, or rather non-supporting, pillars are still to be seen. But the bridge fell down, one day, into the river; and--alas! alas!--with the bridge fell down an old woman, and a boy, and a cart--a cart and horse--and all found a watery grave together in the spray. No attempt has been made since that to renew the suspension bridge; but the present wooden bridge has been built higher up in lieu of it.|$|E

We ought to commend and commemorate and celebrate them--our Allies' doings--more publicly and explicitly--but the want of imagination hereabouts (save as to that of--to the report of--grand things that haven't happened) is often almost a painful impression.
