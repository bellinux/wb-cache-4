The five elements in the universe correspond to five body functional systems, and that systems are gods residing within the human body. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> meditation is to fix one's undistracted attention to these five, while simultaneously performing the breath exercises mastered in the previous step.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers. At {{the top of}} the social structure was the king, who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo-Saxon life and whose household had special privileges and protection. Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was bound up with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a lower class still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to marks for the dressage movements, marks are also awarded for more general attributes {{such as the}} horse's gaits, submission, impulsion and the riderâ€™s performance. Some segments are given increased weight {{by the use of}} a multiplier, or coefficient. Coefficients are typically given a value of 2, which then doubles the marks given for that segment. Movements that are given a coefficient are generally considered to be particularly important to the horse's progression in training, and should be competently executed prior to moving up to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition. The scores for the general attributes of gait, submission, impulsion, and rider performance mentioned above are scored using a coefficient.|$|E

25|$|Geladas live in {{a complex}} {{multilevel}} society {{similar to that of}} the hamadryas baboon.

Herds consist of up to 60 reproductive units that are sometimes from different bands and last for short periods of time. Communities are made of one to four bands whose home ranges overlap extensively. A gelada can typically live to around 20 years old.|$|E

This analysis utilises the aforementioned FNTS and GTRS data. The {{last part of the}} framework focuses on issues related to the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. For these, energy (i.e. mostly fuel) consumption and vehiclesâ€™ emission data was adopted from VTT [44]. For freight transport, also unit emission data from Network of Transport Measures NTM was used, following the methodology presented by Liimatainen & PÃ¶llÃ¤nen [25]. Based on the unit emission data from these sources, each trip in the FNTS and GTRS data is given an energy consumption and emission factor, which enable detailed analysis of all indicators in the framework.|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} organic electronics is an emerging and very dynamic area.
