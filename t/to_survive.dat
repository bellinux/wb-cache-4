5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b>|$|E

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's ability <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> {{winter in}} the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E

5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> As a result, {{it was thought that}} the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 610 {{aircraft}} were built, including prototypes, and they entered service in 1948 with the Soviet Air Forces.
