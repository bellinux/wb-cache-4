5000|$|The above {{argument}} {{invites the}} conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes [...] "that this dualism is a dualism of objects, with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, sense-data." [...] Perceptual dualism implies:both an act of awareness (or apprehension) and an object (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, {{is that there is no}} need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and elliptical shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience." ...|$|E

We classify the set of determinants into socio-economic, epidemiological and sociologic and cultural and we try to assess the importance of each group of determinants on the spread of the epidemic across the continent. Using panel data of 42 African countries from the 1997 - 2005 period, we examine the link between the three categories of determinants and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. After a logit transformation of the HIV prevalence rate among adult population (15 - 49), we estimate our equation with the random effects model and we include a regional dummy in order to capture sub-regional differences in the spread of the epidemic. Then we estimate the same equation using prevalence rate among young population (15 - 24).

40|$|The {{question}} {{of the nature of}} human activity, its specific formulation and function in social production and reproduction is a fundamental one for any theory of social formation, existence and evolution. There are various forces <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> which do not remain static as they are categories of human needs and consciousness and they are transformed as society changes. Nonetheless theoretical pre-suppositions in general have rested on the validity of rigid argumentations embedded in a tradition of conservative ideology, with their central feature the a priori reduction of population dynamics and social values to eternal natural laws. In this "Hobbesian society" concepts, categories and methods are the products of the very phenomena they are designed to describe; the effect is empirical closure, artificial separation of the object from its history, and the application in any field of the "true or false” hypotheses, which once categorized remain ever so. However, an understanding of the reality depends on the question we ask. Rather than seeking comparabilities in statistical terms and countings according to some unstated value scheme considered as proven, the Marxist commitment is to detailed study of societies, with written or non-written history, based on the dialectical-historical analysis of relationships and contradictions that must be elaborated, refined and tested both through theory and praxis; and this is the concern of the following thesis...|$|E

The input data consisted of crank angle resolved mixture temperature and composition as well as cylinder pressure during the compression stroke. The ignition expression developed was calibrated to simulate the combustion process in gasoline HCCI engines with internal EGR trapping. It is proven that the ignition expression properly manages to predict the trends in auto-ignition timing when varying the engine speed, the temperature at IVC, the cylinder pressure at IVC, the air/fuel ratio or the RGF, when compared with results from the detailed-chemistry HCCI model.

40|$|Most visual search {{theories}} (e. g., Itti & Koch, 2000; Treisman & Sato, 1990; Wolfe, 1994) {{suggest that}} signals from each perceptual dimension (e. g., color, orientation, size) are first analyzed separately and then integrated onto a “salience map”. The {{notion of a}} salience map is central <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> many search phenomena. A core prediction {{of the use of}} a salience map is that across-dimension noise should impair a within-dimension search. However, in most situations across-dimension distractor heterogeneity does not reduce search efficiency (e. g., Treisman, 1988). In this study, we examined factors that may underlie this absence of an effect. In four experiments participants engaged in visual search tasks with target dimensions including color, orientation and size. We found that across-dimension heterogeneity did not influence search efficiency when we varied task (detection or compound search tasks), target salience, or task relevance of the non-target dimension. These results suggest that the lack of an acrossdimension effect was not due to a ceiling effect (i. e., noise being too weak to impair a pop-out search) or top-down suppression to the non-target dimension. It appears that integration of dimensional signals does not occur naturally. However, in a situation where across-dimension distractor heterogeneity was introduced alongside heterogeneous within-dimension distractors, search efficiency was reduced. This suggests that the salience map may be engaged only when it is deemed necessary; for example, when dimension-specific signals do not guide search effectively. Taken together, these results suggest that visual search may be primarily driven by dimension-specific maps. Across-dimension signals may be integrated only when dimension-specific guidance is absent...|$|E

Against all appearances, {{it is not a}} standard beam and it requires a specific formulation in order to take account of the internal pressure which {{plays a key role in}} its mechanical response. This work deals with inflatable beams made of orthotropic materials. The first part of the paper is concerned with the inflation of the membrane tube, an important stage which is often neglected so far in the literature. As preliminaries of the bending problem studied in the next part of the paper, the constitutive law related to the inflated state of the tube – not the natural state – is investigated. It will be shown that the consti-tutive law related to the inflated pre-stressed state is not the same as the constitutive law related to the natural state. Expressions of the material coefficients involved in the former constitutive law will be established from the material coefficients defined on the natural reference configuration which are the only ones supposed to be known. The second part of the paper deals with the bending of the inflatable beam. The Tim-oshenko beam kinematics will be chosen because of the significant shear effect in the tube wall and the problem will be formulated in finite deformations in order <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> all the nonlinear effects, in particular the action due to the internal pressure which is a follower load.

40|$|Shale {{gas content}} {{is the key}} {{parameter}} for shale gas potential evaluation and favorable area prediction. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to determine shale gas content accurately. Generally, we use the US Bureau of Mines (USBM) method for coal reservoirs to calculate the gas content of shale reservoirs. However, shale reservoirs are different from coal reservoirs in depth, pressure, core collection, etc. This method would inevitably cause problems. In order to make the USBM method more suitable for shale reservoirs, an improved USBM method is put forward on the basis of systematic analysis of core pressure history and temperature history during shale gas degassing. The improved USBM method modifies the calculation method of the gas loss time, and determines the temperature balance time of water heating. In addition, we give the calculation method of adsorption gas content and free gas content, especially the new method of calculating the oil dissolved gas content and water dissolved gas content that are easily neglected. We used the direct method (USBM and the improved USBM) and the indirect method (including the calculation of adsorption gas, free gas and the dissolved gas method) to calculate the shale gas content of 16 shale samples of the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Southeastern Ordos Basin, China. The results of the improved USBM method show that the total shale gas content is high, with an average of 3. 97 m 3 /t, and the lost shale gas content is the largest proportion with an average of 62 %. The total shale gas content calculated by the improved USBM method is greater than that of the USBM method. The results of the indirect method show that the total shale gas content is large, with an average of 4. 11 m 3 /t, and the adsorption shale gas content is the largest proportion with an average of 71 %.

40|$|A {{key factor}} for {{a stable and}} solid {{development}} is the gain in labor productivity. The regions that manage {{to pull out of}} poverty and improve the living standards of their inhabitants, in fact, {{need to be able to}} diversify away from agriculture and other traditional sectors. In doing this, the speed with which labour and other resources move to modern economic activities is the key factor that differentiates successful regions from unsuccessful ones. In the paper productivity growth is decomposed in two parts: the ?within? and the ?structural? variation. The first denotes the variation of productivity due exclusively to a change inside individual sectors (employment is kept unaltered) while the second term captures the productivity effect of labour reallocations across different sectors. It is essentially the inner product of productivity levels (at the end of the time period) with the change in employment shares across sectors. When changes in employment shares are positively correlated with productivity levels, this term will be positive, and structural change will increase economy-wide productivity growth. The spatial distribution of ?within? and ?structural? variation gives an interpretation of the spatial patterns that characterize European productivity growth and its sustainability in the long run. In the second part of the paper, to assess what are the impacts of the variables that play a role on ?structural? and ?within? variation, a cross-sectional growth regression model is used. At this regard, it is conceivable that the growth of productivity, and of its two components, depends on own region as well as neighbouring region characteristics, on the spatial connectivity structure of the regions, and on the strength of spatial dependence. In order to take account all these aspects in the analysis, a spatial Durbin model is adopted. This spatial econometric model allows also to solve both the problem of spatial dependence in the residuals and of omitted explanatory variables. Furthermore it includes both spatially lagged dependent and independent variables and allows <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> spatial spillover effects: a change in a single explanatory variable in a certain region has a ?direct impact? on that region as well an ?indirect impact? on other regions due to the spatial connectivity relationships.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Development {{in power}} {{electronics}} enabled sophisticated energy conversion. These new solid-state energy conversion processes are energy-effective, but are inherently non-linear {{which means that}} the load current is typically non-sinusoidal in shape although fed by a sinusoidal voltage source. Although the utility strives to guarantee a pure sinusoidally shaped voltage waveform at every Point of Common Coupling (PCC), harmonic currents deteriorate the overall power quality in the power system. Various undesirable effects of nonsinusoidal conditions in a power system are, possible resonance at power factor capacitors, metering errors, increased reactive power, increased motor losses, increased transformer losses, increased line losses and additional heat in cables and equipment. Harmonic distortion on the power system and within customer facilities is a growing concern due to the growth in non-linear loads, which manifests as higher distortion levels throughout the entire power network. This phenomenon has reached a magnitude where several international bodies have proposed harmonic apportioning standards (IEEE 519 - 1992 (America), IEC 61000 - 3 - 2 (Europe) and NRS 048 (South Africa)). These standards provide the Electricity industry with guidelines in apportioning a predetermined level of harmonic emission per customer connected at the PCC. The harmonic apportioning standards had the result that users and suppliers must be partners in an effort to maintain the quality of supply whilst the network expands. The impact that harmonics can have on the network and other equipment operating from it can range from a minor annoyance to a system malfunction and disruption in operation. Harmonics directly influence the effectiveness of the operation of the utility and its revenue. Customers will not only experience continuous energy losses, but also major production losses when the supply to a plant is disrupted. The harmonic load currents force the utility to have a higher real energy input then the actual real power needed to maintain a plant's production at a certain level. The utility carries the extra transmission losses due to the extra l 2 R losses caused by the harmonic currents. Installed power system capacity will be higher then necessary for pure linear loads. Traditional energy rates fails <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> these effects. A fair tariff structure thus have to be design, which may allocate the cost of waveform distortion according to the relative contribution of loads connected to the PCC, and which will require the utility to supply a minimum distorted voltage signal at the PCC. Such a tariff structure should also recognize the installation of equipment by customers which decrease the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) observed at the PCC, or when they implement new technology, which withdraw sinusoidal load currents.

40|$|Aims: We {{present a}} {{spectral}} {{analysis of a}} new, flux-limited sample of 72 X-ray selected clusters of galaxies identified with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board the Swift satellite down to a flux limit of ~ 10 - 14 erg s- 1 cm- 2 (SWXCS). We carry out a detailed X-ray spectral analysis with the twofold aim of measuring redshifts and characterizing {{the properties of the}} intracluster medium (ICM) {{for the majority of the}} SWXCS sources. Methods: Optical counterparts and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for some of the sources are obtained with a cross-correlation with the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Additional photometric redshifts are computed with a dedicated follow-up program with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and a cross-correlation with the SDSS. In addition, we also blindly search for the Hydrogen-like and He-like iron Kα emission line complex in the X-ray spectrum. We detect the iron emission lines in 35 % of the sample, and hence obtain a robust measure of the X-ray redshift zX with typical rms error 1 - 5 %. We use zX whenever the optical redshift is not available. Finally, for all the sources with measured redshift, background-subtracted spectra are fitted with a single-temperature mekal model to measure global temperature, X-ray luminosity and iron abundance of the ICM. We perform extensive spectral simulations <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> fitting bias, and to assess the robustness of our results. We derive a criterion to select reliable best-fit models and an empirical formula to account for fitting bias. The bias-corrected values are then used to investigate the scaling properties of the X-ray observables. Results: Overall, we are able to characterize the ICM of 46 sources with redshifts (64 % of the sample). The sample is mostly constituted by clusters with temperatures between 3 and 10 keV, plus 14 low-mass clusters and groups with temperatures below 3 keV. The redshift distribution peaks around z ~ 0. 25 and extends up to z ~ 1, with 60 % of the sample at 0. 1 < z < 0. 4. We derive the luminosity-temperature relation for these 46 sources, finding good agreement with previous studies. Conclusions: Thanks to the good X-ray spectral quality and the low background of Swift/XRT, we are able to measure ICM temperatures and X-ray luminosities for the 46 sources with redshifts. Once redshifts are available for the remaining 26 sources, this sample will constitute a well-characterized, flux-limited catalog of clusters distributed over a broad redshift range (0. 1 ≤ z ≤ 1. 0) providing a statistically complete view of the cluster population with a selection function that allows a proper treatment of any measurement bias. The quality of the SWXCS sample is comparable to other samples available in the literature and obtained with much larger X-ray telescopes. Our results have interesting implications for the design of future X-ray survey telescopes, characterized by good-quality PSF over the entire field of view and low background...|$|E

The logic, {{practice}} and semantics of methadone maintenance treatment Author: Frida Petersson Keywords: drug addiction, client construction, methadone treatment, accounts, disciplinary power. Distribution: Égalité, Malmö P. O. Box 5158 SE- 200 71 MALMÖ	 ISBN: 978 - 91 - 979039 - 7 - 4, ISSN: 1401 - 5781 This thesis concerns maintenance treatment with methadone or buprenorhine in Sweden. The general aim {{has been to}} contribute {{to an understanding of}} the everyday practice of maintenance treatment, how power is exercised and how clients are constructed in a local, outpatient treatment context. The study has been conducted at three clinics in the city of Gothenburg and the empirical material comprises fieldnotes from observations, individual interviews with clients and professionals, as well as two focus group interviews with members of clinic staff. In addition, textual documents used in the everyday work at the clinics have been collected. From a general social constructionist perspective, a micro-sociological approach has been applied to the data. Goffman’s interactionism is a major theoretical point of departure. Interviews, narratives and meeting talk are analysed as discourses, with special attention <b>to</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> decisions and rule-breaking behaviour. In addition, Foucault’s works on power and the distinction between discipline and border control occupy a central place in the analysis throughout the dissertation. The main findings are that maintenance treatment does more than provides its clients with medication to control their opiate addiction. In their own stories, the clients describe a kind of institutionalization, triggering identity transformations as well as resistance. The combination and interaction of disciplinary, pastoral and sovereign power technologies, as well as accounts for rules, rule-breaking and sanctions, contribute to the construction of institutionally anchored client categories and in the final analysis, either pitiable or blameworthy clients. The thesis exposes a number of tensions and contradictions within Swedish maintenance treatment. First, despite its attributed status of evidence-based practice for opiate addiction, it is constantly questioned and criticized as treatment approach, since it conflicts with the national goal of a drug free society. Secondly, clients experience a tension between treatment as life-saving (in relation to inclusion) and as a danger of life (in relation to exclusion). A third tension is located between the binary client positions blameworthy, manipulative addict and pitiable, worthy patient, and a fourth one is the recurring, unsolved question whether methadone and buprenorphine clients are ”cured” from their addiction or if they are still drug addicts. Fifthly, there are contradictory views on maintenance treatment as a work in itself, and treatment as a secret and an obstacle to a normal life. Finally, there are tensions between sovereign, disciplinary and pastoral power. These forms of power are based on different logics and are exercised in different ways, but meet, merge, coincide and compete in the studied clinics. These identified tensions reflect the inconsistent context of maintenance treatment and are, in turn, mirrored in and managed through the specific practice, semantics and logics of this way of controlling addiction...|$|E
