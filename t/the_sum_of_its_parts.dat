5|$|Paley {{considers}} how {{the whole}} of a system is more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
25|$|The G8 summits {{during the}} 21st century have {{inspired}} widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> elevating the participants, {{the issues and}} the venue as focal points for activist pressure.|$|E

50|$|But {{there is}} no number that, when added to <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own digits, <b>sums</b> to 132, {{therefore}} 132 is a self number. 132 is also a Harshad number, divisible by <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> base-ten digits.|$|R
25|$|In number theory, {{a perfect}} number is a {{positive}} integer that is equal to <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> proper positive divisors, that is, <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> positive divisors (including itself) i.e. σ1(n)=2n.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business is equal to <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} reduce {{everything}} to simple fundamental laws {{does not imply}} the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gloucestershire {{was very}} {{successful}} in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E

In the event of the merger, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS 60% of the new enlarged organisation. A key French EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to rethink the proposed merger plan as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> It {{was reported}} on 10 October 2012, that the merger between BAE Systems and EADS had been called off.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{sought to}} create {{one of the first}} {{rigorous}} scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, {{he was one of the}} first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society [...] "work"). He also agreed with Spencer's organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was more than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Mass Effect {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game publications. The game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design were highlighted very positively, while the combat and vehicle navigation were generally {{seen as the}} game's weakest features. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described Mass Effect as [...] "a great game with moments of brilliance {{and a number of}} small but significant obstacles that hold it back from reaching its true potential." [...] Similarly, IGN's Erik Brudvig considered it greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> stating that although Mass Effect features numerous technical issues, most of the game [...] "is so expertly delivered that it can transcend its weaknesses." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{was voted}} number 25 on MTV's 25 Best Songs of 2011.

She should go solo more often." [...] The song was also listed on Billboard magazine's Best Songs of 2011 list at number 14. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was listed as The Guardians 14th best song.|$|E
500|$|... "Since I Left You" [...] {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} song a positive review, praising it for [...] "allow the sampled performances to truly glisten." [...] Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson also spoke favourably of [...] "Since I Left You", remarking that it [...] "leaves listeners spellbound {{and in a}} summer dreamscape of lushness and simplicity." [...] Matt LeMay of Pitchfork Media wrote that the [...] "beauty" [...] of the song [...] "lies {{in the way that}} the Avalanches turn obvious sonic mismatches into something all their own". Playlouder named [...] "Since I Left You" [...] the twenty-ninth best single of 2001, calling it [...] "shimmeringly gorgeous" [...] and [...] "much greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> and the parts were pretty good to start with." [...] NME and Rockdelux both included the track in their respective year-end best single lists.|$|E

500|$|Solomon Eliot Asch (September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a Polish gestalt {{psychologist}} and pioneer in social psychology in the United States. He created seminal pieces {{of work in}} impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. [...] His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> but {{the nature of the}} whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: [...] "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" [...] (Asch, 1952, p.61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of 30 Rock was {{reviewed}} favorably by critics. Metacritic gave the pilot episode a Metascore—a weighted average {{based on the}} impressions of a select thirty-one critical reviews—of 67 out of 100. Robert Abele of LA Weekly declared that the show was a [...] "weirdly appropriate and hilarious symbol of our times". The Wall Street Journals Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote that the [...] "standard caution is relevant—debut episodes tend to be highly polished. All {{the more reason to}} enjoy the hilarious scenes and fine ensemble cast here". Some less favorable reviews were received from Brian Lowry of Variety. Lowry said, [...] "Despite her success with Mean Girls, [...] Fey mostly hits too-familiar notes in the pilot. Moreover, she's a limited protagonist, which is problematic." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune criticized [...] "30Rock for being less than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> and, as an entry in the single-camera comedy sweepstakes, it fails to show either the inspired inventiveness of Arrested Development or provide the surprisingly perceptive character studies of The Office".|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} before the 15 January 1987 {{deadline}} set by Island Records to complete the record, the band and the crew completed mixing. As they worked at Melbeach, Lillywhite's wife, singer Kirsty MacColl, volunteered to set the running order for the album. The band told her to put [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] first and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] last, with the rest sequenced according to her preference. Bono said of MacColl's contribution, [...] "Your hope for your album is that it will always be greater than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> It wasn't happening for The Joshua Tree and she came in and she organized it and it worked as an old-fashioned album: a beginning, middle and end." [...] Around 2 AM, just seven hours before the album was due to Island for mastering, the Edge tried to convince Lillywhite to allow him to add backing vocals to [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", but he was refused. In the morning, Meegan and Lillywhite flew with the album's tapes to Island's offices in Hammersmith, London.|$|E

500|$|However, Internet {{film critic}} James Berardinelli, {{in spite of}} {{awarding}} it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, gave the film a somewhat scathing review. On his website, Berardinelli wrote that [...] "Meet the Parents is put together like a TV sit-com," [...] that Roach [...] "strings together a series of hit-and-miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent, interesting, or enjoyable (in most cases, it's none of those three)" [...] and concluding that [...] "even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News, another detractor of the film, proclaimed Meet the Parents [...] "only erratically funny" [...] and accused Roach of taking [...] "the cheap way out with a series of unfunny jokes." [...] Critic Peter Bradshaw's review of the film in The Guardian concludes that Meet the Parents [...] "is somehow less than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> It strains to come to life, but never quite makes it." [...] After the film was released on home media, DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone magazine contributor Douglas Pratt in his book Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More! stated that [...] "perhaps in the crowded theater the film is hysterical, but in the quieter venue of home video, it just seems sadistic, and as the humor evaporates, the holes in the plot become clearer." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} 8 on 10, Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation's lack of new tracks, and said [...] "while far from immaculate, {{this is still}} quite a collection". About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less than <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> even if this {{is a good way to}} get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E
