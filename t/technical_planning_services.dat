40|$|The New Haven Unified School District is {{inviting}} proposals from qualified firms, partnerships, corporations, associations, {{or professional}} organizations to provide comprehensive professional architectural and associated <b>technical</b> <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> to the District. The District {{is engaged in}} ongoing new construction and major modernization projects, site development and planning, growth projects (placement and installation of relocatable buildings), and implementing an area-wide master plan associated with the recent passage of a local bond issue. The District will be making the assignment of architects for the various projects. The selected firms {{will be expected to}} design, produce construction drawings, and obtain final DSA approval by a mutually agreeable date. The projects may be built using a variety of project delivery and construction management approaches. The Architect will be expected to work with the District’s representatives during both the design and construction phases of the projects. The New Haven Unified School District serves the residents of Union City, California, a richly diverse community of about 74, 000.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present the {{complexity}} of projecting, evaluating and comparison of exploitation of farm tractors. The article contains main information about projecting the procedures of evaluation of <b>planned</b> <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> of tractors. This work also contains an attempt to describe a method of evaluation of technical service. It is illustrated on {{the example of the}} cost of farm tractors servicing. Tractors had similar operating parameters but they were from different manufacturers. A method like that could be useful for users of tractors, while making decisions about purchase of new tractors for their farms. The reason of looking for a method of evaluation of <b>planned</b> <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> of agricultural machines is lack of access to the inform­ation about the cost of servicing. It is also a result of lack of appropriate method of gaining inform­ation like this by tractor users. It is important to add, that having at user’s disposal information about technical service of tractors could improve the decision making process about buying a new tractor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} family <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> use and the barriers in accessing family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> among urban poor women in Pakistan. Data were collected from a household survey of 5338 married women of reproductive age (15 - 45) from slum areas of six cities. The use of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> by women in urban slums is strongly linked to individual and household socioeconomic factors. In particular, women were ten {{times more likely to}} have used a family <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> if her husband approved. This research has highlighted two key issues regarding the provision of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> to the urban poor. First, the urban poor cannot be treated as a homogenous group; there exist important socio-demographic variations within the urban poor population in relation to their use of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> and the barriers faced in service utilization. Second, although the urban poor are both economically and physically disadvantaged in access to services, women identified socio-cultural factors as the greatest barrier to family <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> use. This finding is consistent with studies focusing on the general population of Pakistan. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to empirically examine the {{determinants}} of demand for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> in Kenya’s slums using a binomial logit model. The study revealed low usage of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> due to various factors. In order of significance, these include partner’s approval, quality of the services, friendliness of the staff administering the services and the woman’s knowledge about family <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> Others were the woman’s income level, proximity to the provider and the religious background of the woman. In lieu of the findings, various recommendations were suggested to enhance use of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> in the slums as a bold step towards enhance uptake of family <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> Other than reviving and enhancing the activities of community based distributors, promotion of family planning education and activities at the household level should be carried out. Similarly, formation of lobby groups to enhance cultural change, as well as awareness creation and counselling, and integration of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> with HIV/AIDS were also been recommended. </p...|$|R

Methods: This study used secondary data analysis {{from the results of}} the Intercensal Population Survey (SUPAS) in 2015. The sample is 189, 652 ever married women, aged 10 - 54 years in all provinces in Indonesia, and have received family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> both before and during JKN. The analysis used chi-square test. Result: One year after the introduction of the JKN program, the proportion of contraceptive use including the Long-term Contraceptive Method (LTCM) fell significantly compared to before JKN, whereas injections and pills remained high. Family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> at Puskesmas increased sharply, while hospital and government service both went down and services by doctors and private practice midwives remained high. Utilization of BPJS health card for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> is still low. The use of BPJS Health card for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> has a significant relationship to the use of LTCM. Conclusion: Non contraceptive use of LTCM is still high.
