5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E

25|$|Confidentiality is {{mandated}} in America by HIPAA laws, {{specifically the}} Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> been carved {{out over the}} years. For example, many states require physicians to report gunshot wounds {{to the police and}} impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Commander's Edition <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> been organized with lettered major chapters, followed by a number to indicate a major rule. Then follows a decimal, {{and a series of}} numbers indicating the breakdown into subsections. (For instance, (D6.683) is the third subsection of (D6.68) Disrupted Fire Control, which is the eighth subsection of (D6.6) Active Fire Control, which is the sixth section of (D6.0) Fire Control Systems, which is the sixth rule in (D0.0) Combat.) Chapter R is an exception; as it is a listing of every ship type in the game, the number after the decimal is a sequental number identifier. e.g., (R2.12) is the Police Cutter, the eleventh Federation ship in the game (as (R2.1) is background information). Occasionally, a chapter might have sub-chapters, which are indicated with two letters.|$|E

While the heavyweight championship is traditionally considered the most prestigious weight division in professional wrestling, CMLL places more emphasis on the lower weight divisions.

500|$|The {{rules of}} chess have evolved {{much over the}} centuries from the early chess-like games played in India in the 6th century. For much of that time <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> varied from area to area. The modern rules first took form in Italy during the 13th century, giving more {{mobility}} to pieces that previously had more restricted movement (such as the queen and bishop). Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century [...] or early 16th century [...] The basic moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. Pawns originally {{did not have the}} option of moving two squares on their first move and promoted only to a queen if they reached the eighth rank. The queen was originally the fers or farzin, which could move one square diagonally in any direction. In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally, forwards, backwards, or to left or right on its first move; some area also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn. In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a pīl (Persian) or fīl (Arabic) (meaning [...] "elephant") which moved two squares diagonally with jump [...] In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be promoted to the equivalent of a queen (which at that time was the weakest piece) if it reached its eighth rank [...] During the 12th century the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors, and this became the standard in the 13th century [...]|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>has</b> {{existed in}} <b>the</b> Laws of the Game {{more or less}} {{unchanged}} ever since - {{with the exception of}} the period from 1925 until 1938, during which time <b>the</b> basic out-of-bounds <b>rules</b> provided for a free kick to always paid against the last player to touch the ball before it went out of bounds whether it was deliberate or not, making the specific provisions of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> redundant. Although <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>has</b> been largely unchanged, the strictness of its application has varied over time.|$|R

2500|$|D ^ Poland, the United Kingdom and Germany all {{received}} {{a total of}} 14 points. Whilst {{the rules of the}} contest describe mechanisms to break a tie should it be for first place, it is ambiguous as to whether the procedure applies to other rankings. Should the rules apply, Germany having received more twelve points than the others would be ranked 23rd, Poland having scored more ten points than the UK would be ranked 24th, leaving the UK in 25th and last place. A table located at the contest's official website, , shows the ties as broken, however in all previous years the same source has shown unbroken ties.

2500|$|The use of immunoinformatics tools can {{be useful}} to predict protein {{allergenicity}} and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> been well reported [...] So to make these things easier computational tools and algorithms have been actively developed to assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products.|$|E
2500|$|Second, the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 enable unified work councils in {{multinational}} enterprises, {{operating in}} the EU. This is most likely for US multinational enterprises. In [...] "community scale undertakings" [...] or corporate [...] "groups" [...] with over 1000 employees, and 150 employees in two or more member states, employees {{have a right to}} a transnational work council to consult on any [...] "probable trend of employment, investments, and substantial changes... introduction of new working methods or production processes... and collective redundancies." [...] A [...] "group" [...] of undertakings exists when one undertaking has a [...] "dominant influence" [...] over another, for instance through company share ownership or rights to appoint or remove directors. Other features of transnational work councils are similar to the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004. Management can initiate a work council, or 100 employees in at least two undertakings and member states can make a request. Then, a [...] "special negotiating body" [...] (elected worker representative and management) will try to seek an agreement on the terms. If agreement cannot be reached, a template set of [...] "subsidiary requirements" [...] will form the work council's constitution. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> been criticised for not going further, or being integrated with other consultation laws, although every member state in the EU is able to go beyond the minimum standards laid down.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about associations' property, that came to be the dominant and practical view, was first stated by Brightman J in Re Recher's Will Trusts. Here it was said that, if no words are used that indicate a trust is intended, a [...] "gift takes effect in favour of the existing members of the association as an accretion to the funds which are the subject-matter of the contract". In other words, property will be held according to the members' contractual terms of their association. This matters for deciding whether a gift will succeed or be held to fail, although that possibility is unlikely on any contemporary view. It also matters where an association is being wound up, and there is a dispute over who should take the remaining property. In a recent decision, Hanchett‐Stamford v Attorney‐General Lewison J held that the final surviving member of the [...] "Performing and Captive Animals Defence League" [...] was entitled to the remaining property of the association, although while the association was running any money could not be used for the members' private purposes. On the other hand, if money is donated to an organisation, and specifically intended to be passed onto others, then the end of an association could mean that remaining assets will go back to the people the money came from (on [...] "resulting trust") or be bona vacantia. In Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, Goff J held that a fund set up for the dependants of police staff, which was being wound up, which had been given money expressly for reason of benefiting dependants (and not to benefit the members of the trust) could not be taken by those members. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>have</b> also mattered, however for the purpose of taxation. In Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell it was held that the Conservative Party, and its various limbs and branches, was not all bound together by a contract, and so not subject to corporation tax.|$|E
