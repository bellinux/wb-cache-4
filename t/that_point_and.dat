5|$|Like {{the contest}} against Missouri, sportswriters touted the Texas A game as {{showcasing}} {{two of the}} best dual-threat quarterbacks playing in college football. However, Texas A's starting quarterback Reggie McNeal missed the game due to an ankle injury; instead, freshman quarterback Stephen McGee made his first start. The game was a back-and-forth affair ultimately won by Texas, 40–29. The elevenpoint win was their second slimmest margin of victory of the regular season to <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> they lost points in all threemajor polls but still remained solidly in secondplace.|$|E

5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon and the Russians fled.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the match, Queen's Park and Blackburn Rovers had met {{on three}} occasions; {{each time the}} game ended in a draw. Queen's went into the match as the favourites, being the most {{successful}} club in Scotland at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> having developed a style of play involving short passing which was not in use in England.

5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and {{accused him of}} drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{was the largest}} allied military action mounted {{during the war in}} South Vietnam to <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> the first fought at division level. Despite some success, the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and it remained a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war. The tunnels were later used as a staging area for the attack on Saigon during the 1968 Tet offensive before they were largely destroyed by heavy bombing from American B-52 bombers in 1970, ending their utility.|$|E

Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Mehldau {{moved to}} New York City in 1988 to study jazz and {{contemporary}} music at The New School. He studied under pianists Fred Hersch, Junior Mance and Kenny Werner, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. In 1989 Mehldau {{was part of}} saxophonist Christopher Hollyday's band that toured for several months; {{as a result of}} playing so often with one group, Mehldau was able to assimilate the music of Wynton Kelly and McCoy Tyner, his two principal influences on piano up to <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> began to develop his own sound.

5|$|At the time, John was in {{south-east}} England recruiting mercenaries {{in preparation}} for his war with the barons. Rochester blocked the direct route to London, which was also held by the rebels. According to Roger of Wendover, the rebels at Rochester were led by William d'Aubigny, lord of Belvoir. Estimates {{of the size of}} Rochester's garrison vary, with the chroniclers' figures ranging from 95 to 140knights, supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. Hearing the news that the city was in enemy hands, John immediately rode to Rochester and arrived on 13October. Royal forces had arrived ahead of John and entered the city on 11October, taking it by surprise and laying siege to the castle. Rochester bridge was pulled down to prevent the arrival of a relief force from London. The siege that followed was the largest in England up to <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> would take nearly two months.|$|E
5|$|Beitia's three {{successful}} {{field goals}} tied a Gator Bowl record.

The 77-yard pass from Rix to Walker was the third-longest in Gator Bowl history. On {{the opposite side}} of the ball, Davis' 158 receiving yards were the ninth-most recorded in Gator Bowl history, and his 55-yard reception from Noel was the ninth-longest in Gator Bowl history. The two receivers' totals also were Virginia Tech bowl-game records: in one case, for receiving yards gained by a single player, in the other, for receiving yards allowed by a single player.|$|E
5|$|Clemson {{returned}} Georgia Tech's kickoff to its 43-yard line, {{but despite}} the good field position, Clemson was unable to take advantage. On the first play of the drive, Clemson quarterback Parker threw an interception to Georgia Tech defender Dominique Reese, who went out of bounds at the Tech 45-yard line. Georgia Tech's offense returned to the field at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> began driving down the field. In two plays, Tech passed the 50-yard line. In six more, it penetrated the Clemson 10-yard line. Once there, however, the Yellow Jackets' drive stalled. Three consecutive penalties against Georgia Tech pushed the Yellow Jackets back 20 yards, and Tech was unable to score a touchdown or gain a first down after that setback. Kicker Blair again returned to the field and scored a 49-yard field goal. With 5:35 remaining in the first half, Georgia Tech extended its lead to 13–7.|$|E
