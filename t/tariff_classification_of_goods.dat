40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reform of}} the external tariff initiated by the CEMAC and the WAEMU that is aimed at reinforcing their economic integration. Overall, there is broad compliance with the streamlined and moderate rates, but with significant deviations from the harmonized paths in several countries. WAMZ countries, except Ghana, need to undertake major reforms in order to align their external tariff structures {{with that of the}} WAEMU as planned for 2007. To promote full compliance with the harmonized external tariff policies, the paper suggests, measures need to be taken, including the creation of financial incentives, at the regional and country levels.

40|$|The Common Commercial Policy is the {{essential}} basis of the European Union (hereinafter - the EU), which, in particular, is a free trade area between the 28 Member States with a common external customs tariff and a common foreign trade policy as well as common trade rules with the third countries. Implementation of this policy {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is based on an exclusive competence of the EU, which after the Treaty of Lisbon (2009) became even more apparent. Therefore the countries of the EU should follow the same legal principles and rules in the regulation of their foreign trade, that is to apply the uniform EU rules on the calculation of customs duties and determination of the customs origin of goods, customs valuation and <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> (Common Customs Tariff). However, implementation of these provisions is always experiencing stress due to the different interests of the EU Member States and the different national practices, especially when the administration of customs duties is actually implemented only at the level of individual EU Member States. Therefore the aim of the article is to assess the implementation of the EU’s CCP from the perspective of the EU Member State (Lithuania) and to describe existing discrepancies which may serve as an obstacle for the development of common regulatory regime for import customs duties in the EU or hinder its main economic goals in international trade. Analysis of relevant scientific problems is mainly based on the comparative method (comparison of the practice of the national courts in the Republic of Lithuania and the Court of Justice of the European Union in disputes related to the functioning of the EU's customs union) and generalization of professional experience (national and EU judicial practice). The research leads to the conclusion that a uniform implementation of Common Commercial Policy and the Common Customs Tariff, as its main element, is not fully ensured on the practical level from the perspective of certain Member States (i. e. Lithuania) ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{responsibilities}} of a customs administration is the collection of customs duties on imported goods. This necessitates the <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> in question. As a result of South Africa’s membership of the World Customs Organization, specific obligations in relation to <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> are incurred. <b>Tariff</b> <b>classification</b> is a highly technical and intricate undertaking, subject to both national and international law. Especially the implementation and application of the international provisions result in varying interpretations by stakeholders. This, inevitably, results in disputes. This article discusses the position in South Africa regarding customs <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> dispute resolution and compares the South African provisions and practices with those in Australia and Canada. The differences in the approach to dispute resolution in the three countries are critically analysed. In conclusion {{it is recommended that}} South Africa should consider introducing an independent tribunal {{along the lines of the}} tribunals established in Australia and Canada, or, alternatively, extending the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to include customs duty disputes. am 2015 Mercantile La...|$|R

40|$|Can governments improve bureaucratic {{performance}} by "hiring integrity" {{from the private}} sector? In the past 2 decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct preshipment inspections of imports, generating independent data on the value and <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> incoming shipments. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in import duty collections. By contrast, {{the growth rate of}} other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in falsification of import documentation are behind the import duty improvements; the programs also lead to declines in undervaluation and misreporting <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>classifications.</b> Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective, with improvements in import duty collections in the first 5 years of a typical inspection program amounting to 2. 6 times the program's costs.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{rules for}} the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> into a customs tariff which complies with the Harmonized System for the Description and Coding <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (HS) are according to General Rule 1, the six general rules <b>of</b> <b>classification,</b> the terms <b>of</b> headings and the notes (and according to General Rule 6 the terms of subheadings and subheading notes). The rules of the tariff schedule are complex, and whilst the overall numbers of headings and subheadings are known, the notes of the HS-nomenclature, the combined nomenclature (CN) and the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) of the European Community (EC) have not been examined in a systematic way. This paper identifies all notes (and subheading notes) which are in force worldwide as at HS 2007 (for sections and chapters) and examines also the sections and chapters for which the EC has established further so-called ‘additional notes’, which are valid only within the EC. The HS 2007 contains 380 notes and 56 subheading notes which are valid worldwide, and the EC has added 98 additional notes within the CN and the CCT (as of May 2007). The 534 notes that accompany the 1, 221 HS-headings, 5, 052 HS-subheadings and 9, 720 CN-subheadings are proof {{of the complexity of}} the rules of the CCT which contains more than 16, 500 legal {{rules for the}} <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|R
