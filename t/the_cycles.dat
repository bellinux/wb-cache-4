5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} to explain <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone {{in this endeavor}} was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E

5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern marbled newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
