5|$|The club held an {{architecture}} competition, and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball {{announced that they}} had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he {{wanted to build a}} larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added <b>tax</b> <b>refund,</b> NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E
25|$|Income <b>tax</b> <b>refund</b> {{anticipation}} {{loans are}} not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income <b>tax</b> <b>refund,</b> not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E

25|$|Colorado has a flat 4.63% income tax, {{regardless}} of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal adjusted gross income, Colorado taxes {{are based on}} taxable income—income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions. Colorado's state sales tax is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, according to Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights legislation, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales <b>tax</b> <b>refund</b> on their individual state income tax return.

25|$|At common law, {{and under}} some earlier tax statutes, {{the filing of}} a protest {{at the time of}} payment of an {{erroneous}} tax was a requirement in order for the payor to recover a refund of the tax at a later time. In the case of U.S. federal taxes, the rule was abolished by Congress in 1924. Under the current Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the taxpayer's failure to protest does not deprive the taxpayer of the right to file an administrative claim with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a refund and, if the claim is not allowed by the IRS, to sue for a <b>tax</b> <b>refund</b> in Federal district court.|$|E

Although tax expenditures are skewed toward middle- and high-income households, tax transfers to lowincome households increased substantially during the last decade.

Research shows that many families view lump-sum <b>tax</b> <b>refunds</b> as “assets. ” Thus, there are compelling reasons to leverage <b>tax</b> <b>refunds</b> for asset building.

500|$|On December 29, 2012, [...] "Dr. Sam Kennedy," [...] {{whose real}} name is Glenn Richard Unger, was arrested after having been indicted on one count of {{attempting}} {{to interfere with the}} administration of the internal revenue laws under Internal Revenue Code section 7212(a), four counts of filing false claims for tax refunds under 18 USC section 287, one count of tax evasion under Internal Revenue Code section 7201, and one count of uttering a fictitious obligation under 18 USC section 514(a)(2). He was charged with filing more than $36 million in fraudulent federal income <b>tax</b> <b>refund</b> claims. On January 2, 2013, a federal prosecutor asserted in a court hearing for Unger that Unger was a danger to the community and that Unger had stated that he would rather die than become subject to the government. The indictment alleged, among other things, that in June 2011 Unger submitted false documents with the Clerk's Office of Saratoga County, New York, in an attempt to release a $116,410.43 federal tax lien against him, for taxes and penalties for years 2004, 2005, and 2006. The Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking at Unger (alias [...] "Sam Kennedy") in the spring of 2010, after the incident involving the letters sent to the state governors. Prosecutors also charged that Unger filed no valid federal income tax returns between 1999 and 2005. On May 23, 2013, the court ordered a mental competency hearing for Unger after he referred to himself as being [...] "deceased." [...] On August 7, 2013, the Court ruled that Unger was competent to stand trial. After a four-day trial Unger was found guilty of all charges by a jury in Federal court in Albany, New York, on October 21, 2013. On April 21, 2014, Unger was sentenced to eight years in Federal prison.|$|E

2500|$|An {{investigation}} into the city's property taxes found that the homeowners of Bell were paying a rate {{higher than those of}} the affluent Beverly Hills. Homeowners in Bell pay the second-highest tax rate of any city in Los Angeles County. Wendy Watanabe, Los Angeles County's auditor-controller, stated that residents of Bell pay as much as 1.55% of their home's assessed value in taxes, 34% above the norm. State Controller John Chiang said the raised rate was illegal. Wantanabe said the average for the county is 1.16%. Auditors had discovered that taxpayers were overcharged the $2.9 million for a [...] "retirement tax" [...] to fund city employee pensions. Under California's state tax code, the nearly $3 million overpaid by Bell homeowners, should be redirected to local schools, however, on September 1, 2010, lawmakers approved AB 900 by Assemblyman Kevin De Leon (D- Los Angeles), which returns $2.9 million in property tax refunds directly to the overcharged city residents. On September 13, 2010 Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, approved the bill. Because the Montebello Unified School District's boundaries include a small area of Bell, it was to receive a portion of the $2.9 million property <b>tax</b> <b>refund</b> slated to be returned to Bell under A.B. 900, which was signed into law by Lt.
