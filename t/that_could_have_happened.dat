25|$|Rotimi, {{a patriot}} who shunned the {{attraction}} of the West and Europe and returned home to contribute his own quota to nation building, was a rare breed. Diminutive in size but a giant in drama in Africa, {{he was one of}} the best things <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the literary community.|$|E
25|$|For their sophomore release, {{the band}} {{chose to stay}} with their record label The Control Group, founded by Nabil Ayers. Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red {{was the best thing}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the band, {{comparing}} it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.|$|E
25|$|Solomon {{believes}} {{that his son}} is alive, just perhaps not in the U.S. In spring of 2011, after the visit to the doctor {{that was the last}} independent record of Sky's presence outside of Biryukova's household, he recalled that her estranged father came from Ukraine to visit her. He wondered to the Weekly if the older man could have taken the boy back to that country with him at the time. But he admitted that by 2013 {{he did not know how}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all the good things <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship." [...] Ralph Friedgen responded by saying [...] "He's gotta get over it," [...] and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disappointing". Despite noting that it is [...] "a totally serviceable episode of Adventure Time", {{he argued that the}} episode felt too much like an episode from the show's first or second seasons, when installments were often lacking in depth and a bit more uneven across the board. He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is for the kids. It’s simple and easy to follow, and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … but that also prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hed PE {{signed with}} Jive Records, {{releasing}} their self-titled debut album in 1997. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and {{we thought it would be}} cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> [...] We've had offers from Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} [...] "pleased" [...] to win the race and admitted that he waited until the pit stop phase to have any chance of overtaking Michael Schumacher. He said that his team had more work to do on his car and was looking forward to the next race. Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> for the team and myself." [...] He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not been good for him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.|$|E
500|$|With {{no water}} to {{lubricate}} them, plate tectonics would very likely stop {{and the most}} visible signs of geological activity would be shield volcanoes located above mantle hotspots. In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multi-cellular life. Most of these microbes will be halophiles and life could find too refuge in the atmosphere as has been proposed <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> on Venus. However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years and 2.8 billion years from now, {{with the last of}} them living in residual ponds of water at high latitudes and heights or in caverns with trapped ice; underground life, however, could last longer. What happens next depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a [...] "supergreenhouse" [...] state like that of the planet Venus. But as stated above without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried until the Sun became a red giant and its increased luminosity heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|To {{give the}} {{illusion}} that the game world is always available, persistence can be simulated. This {{can be achieved by}} scheduling when players are allowed to play, around times when the world is offline, or as in the Animal Crossing series, having the game generate events <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> during the period of inactivity. Aside from virtual worlds, the simulation of a persistent world is also possible in single player games. In Noctis, players are advised to turn off the game while refueling because it takes so long. In addition, if a player who has landed on a planet stops playing and then after a while resumes, he or she can see visible changes in the sea level or the daytime/nighttime cycle. In Metal Gear Solid 3. If one stops playing long enough during the fight of Snake with [...] "The End", he will die of old age.|$|E

2500|$|Coming off {{his third}} NHL season, Clarke {{was the last}} player Team Canada {{selected}} {{to play in the}} Summit Series. His line with Ron Ellis and Paul Henderson turned out to be Canada's best during the series, Clarke tallying two goals and four assists in the eight game series won by Canada as well as being awarded Team Canada MVP in game one of the series. Clarke's play earned the respect of many during the series, Henderson saying, [...] "The best thing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to Ronnie (Ellis) and me was to get this young kid making plays for us. He was terrific!" [...] Wayne Cashman would add, [...] "There were guys on Team Canada who took their game to new heights in that series. A perfect example would be Bobby Clarke." [...] The Soviet team's assistant coach, Boris Kulagin, thought Clarke was Canada's best player. Clarke's strong play was largely attributed to the fact that, unlike many of the Canadian players, Clarke reported to training camp in top physical condition, as he had always followed a strict off-season training regimen. [...] Though he earned much praise due to his play, he was also criticized for an incident during the sixth game which is often referred to as, [...] "The Slash." ...|$|E
2500|$|After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts {{building}} {{a relationship with}} Silas. Actress Hayley Erin said [...] "They have a little relationship, and it's sweet" [...] but Silas cannot replace Ava. Kiki really tries to establish that connection with Silas and they do but [...] "She just wishes he were around more." [...] In [...] "losing" [...] Ava, Kiki [...] "lost herself" [...] and resorts to questionable actions such as drugging Michael {{in an attempt to}} make sure he loses custody of their sister. Kiki descends further into turmoil when she finds Silas stabbed to death and believing Franco is guilty she feels [...] "sheer hatred" [...] for him. What makes it most difficult is that she has trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. [...] "I took it personally" [...] she said. The actress later continued, [...] "But it made for a great storyline {{and there was a lot}} of great material for all of us." [...] Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back. Kiki's glee at having Ava back is ruined when she learns about Ava and Morgan's secret affair. Erin noted the irony of Kiki having Ava for a mother as [...] "the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to anyone" [...] while the actress said getting to work opposite Maura West is the [...] "greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone." [...] She continued, [...] "I love it, because she makes me step up my game." ...|$|E
