5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No <b>temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status</b> has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, D.C. {{newspaper}} Roll Call {{first reported}} the possible connection of Ingmar Guandique to the case, with {{little effect on}} the news media's focus on Condit. Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin noted the lack of headlines that an illegal immigrant had been questioned in the Levy case. She said that in her review of 115 news items from the Lexis-Nexis database, not a single mention of Guandique referred to his status as a [...] "criminal illegal alien". She called the [...] "glaring omission" [...] of his status [...] "a newsworthy act of negligence". She wrote that only the very conservative Human Events reported that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had approved his working legally while applying for <b>temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status.</b> That application was ultimately denied, but not before he had assaulted two other women at Rock Creek Park.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{documents of}} immigration from Nicaragua to the United States was combined in total {{with those of}} other Central American countries. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau some 7,500 Nicaraguans legally immigrated from 1967 to 1976. An estimated 28,620 Nicaraguans were living in the U.S. in 1970, 90% of which self-reported as [...] "white" [...] on the 1970 census. Most Nicaraguan immigrants during the late 1960s were women: there were only 60 male Nicaraguan immigrants for every 100 female immigrants during this period. In 1998 more than two million Nicaraguans were left homeless due to hurricane Mitch, as a result many Nicaraguans received permanent residence or <b>temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status</b> (TPS) in the late 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, many Congressional Democrats took up {{the cause}} of the Central American refugees—due {{in large part to the}} {{lobbying}} and publicity efforts of Sanctuary members. In 1990, the House and Senate approved a bill granting <b>temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status</b> (TPS) to Central Americans in need of safe haven, but not until the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act did Congress allow fleeing Central Americans to apply for permanent residence.|$|E

5000|$|Under TPS, {{individuals}} are given relief from deportation as temporary {{refugees in the}} United States. Under TPS {{individuals are}} given protected status if found that “conditions in that country pose a danger to personal safety due to ongoing armed conflict or an environmental disaster”. This status is granted typically for 6 to 18 month periods, eligible for renewal unless the individual's <b>Temporary</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Status</b> is terminated by USCIS. If withdrawal of TPS occurs, the individual faces exclusion or deportation proceedings.|$|E

It has been a center of local conservation efforts, and was granted <b>temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status</b> in July 2007 by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests, the first step toward making it Madagascar's first natural monument.|$|E
50|$|Besides these {{immigrant}} visas {{there were}} also changes in nonimmigrant visas like the H-1B visa for highly skilled workers. There were also cutbacks in the allotment of visas available for extended relatives. The <b>Temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status</b> visa was also created where Congress established a procedure by which the Attorney General may provide TPS to immigrants in the United States who are temporarily unable to safely return to their home country because of ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary condition. It specifically benefited citizens of El Salvador.|$|E

50|$|Easing refugee {{immigration}} into Canada {{was discussed}} by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, {{and in the}} US Haitians were granted <b>Temporary</b> <b>protected</b> <b>status,</b> a measure that permits about 100,000 illegal alien Haitians in the United States to stay legally for 18 months, and halts the deportations of 30,000 more, though it {{does not apply to}} Haitians outside the US. Local and state agencies in South Florida, together with the US government, began implementing a plan ("Operation Vigilant Sentry") for a mass migration from the Caribbean that had been laid out in 2003.|$|E
50|$|IJDH {{advocates for}} the {{creation}} of a Haitian Family Reunification Program. In 2010, nine days before the devastating earthquake, the Department of Homeland Security granted Haiti a <b>temporary</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Status</b> for 18 months. This was extended twice to its current expiration date, July 22, 2014. TPS protects Haitians, who have arrived in Haiti before a certain date, from deportation. Immediately after the earthquake many members of congress indicated support for a system mirroring the Cuban program. This would allow many Haitians to join their families in the United States while they wait for visa status.|$|E
50|$|One area of U.S. {{politics}} in which Salvadoran Americans have {{played an important}} role is in legislation regarding their immigration status. In the debate leading to the passage of <b>Temporary</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Status</b> for Salvadoran refugees and the extensions of that status, Salvadoran organizations lobbied politicians and brought their cases of persecution to the press. At first, refugee organizations were run by Americans, and Salvadorans often appeared in public only with bandannas over their faces. Gradually, Salvadorans and other Central Americans began to take charge of the refugee organizations and assume a higher public profile.|$|E
