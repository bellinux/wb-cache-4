5|$|Chris Candido was an American {{professional}} wrestler who wrestled for TNA {{starting in}} 2005. At TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April24, 2005, Candido teamed with Lance Hoyt to face Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match. During the encounter, Candido suffered an injury which was later diagnosed as a dislocated ankle, broken tibia, {{and a broken}} fibula which required surgery. Candido had an operation on April25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> with him being sidelined from competing {{for two to three}} months in order to heal. However, Candido hoped to be fully recovered in six to eight weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed, where he died a short time later. The cause of death was released by Candido's brother Johnny as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the update.|$|E
5|$|Besides Chris Candido {{suffering}} a leg injury during his tag team match, Abyss also suffered a dislocated shoulder during {{the main event}} against A.J. Styles. Abyss' injury was taken care of backstage after the event, but Candido {{was diagnosed with a}} dislocated ankle, broken tibia, and a broken fibula that required surgery. Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Candido was reported to be sidelined for 2 to 3 months. According to reports, Candido suffered the injury from taking a dropkick by Sonny Siaki and landing on his leg improperly. After the surgery, he hoped to be recovered in 6 to 8 weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed where he died a short time later. Cause of death was released by his brother Johnny afterwards as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior. TNA released a public statement on April29 regarding the subject. TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April29 episode of Impact! as well as at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event. The April29 episode of Impact! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido. At Hard Justice, a ten-bell salute was held while a photo of Candido, a pair of boots, and one-half of the NWA World Tag Team Championship positioned on a steel chair sat in the center of the ring. In TNA's 50 Greatest Moments DVD, Candido's aiding The Naturals to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship was listed as number 10. A portion of the Lockdown DVD sale profits were donated by TNA to the Chris Candido Memorial Fund. TNA originally planned to remove Candido's match from the DVD, but were given the blessing of his family to include it on the publication. A tribute to Candido was included on the DVD by TNA.|$|E
