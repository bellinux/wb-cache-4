5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} quick enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E

Jacqui violates her prison tag after staying at Tony's house overnight so she is sent back to prison. Sadly, Tony is forced to dump her because he cannot handle the pressure. Jacqui befriends Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) but Becca is killed by another prisoner and Jacqui is devastated. Jacqui decides <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> herself, not wanting to waste her life and is reunited with Tony and Davey returns with the favour. He forces Jacqui to marry Aleksander Malota (Jon Lolis). Jacqui and Aleksander manage to convince an immigration officer that their romance is genuine and they are married but Jacqui continues her affair with Tony secretly. The family uncover {{the truth about the}} marriage when Carmel and Alek's affair is revealed. Jacqui admits she married Alek to pay off her debt to Davey and is seeing Tony. Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is furious and orders Jacqui, Alek and Carmel to leave the house. Jacqui announces her pregnancy; Tony initially doesn't want the child, fearing that it may die like his previous child and their dreams are shattered when Jacqui miscarries and is left unable to have children of her own. Tony attacks Alek violently as he blames Alek as he cannot grieve for his baby publicly. Tony announces to the people in The Dog that the baby was his, not Alek's and Jacqui asks Alek to return to Albania so she can live her life and he agrees. Carmel is shocked to discover Alek is leaving, leaving Carmel devastated.

25|$|Hazlitt also visited various picture galleries, and {{he began}} to get work doing portraits, {{painting}} somewhat in the style of Rembrandt. In this fashion, he managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a living for a time, travelling back and forth between London and the country, wherever he could get work. By 1802, his work was considered good enough that a portrait he had recently painted of his father was accepted for exhibition by the Royal Academy.|$|E

He visited all of the western states plus England, Japan, China, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, Arabia, Egypt, and Panama, finally moving with his parents to Choctaw, Oklahoma in the early 1930s.

25|$|Membership in the {{legislature}} is best regarded as being a full-time job during the session and a part-time job {{the rest of the}} year due to committee meetings and hearings (for which legislators are reimbursed their expenses and receive a mileage allowance). A few members are on enough committees <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a living from being legislators; most are independent businesspeople and attorneys, although the latter group is perhaps no longer the absolute majority of members that it at one time comprised. In keeping with Tennessee's agricultural roots, some senators and representatives are farmers.|$|E

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Ebony and Jet magazines, Jackson {{said that he}} had gotten the idea for the song from a true story that he had read about in Time or Newsweek magazine. Jackson stated that the story said that a student that went to school in upstate New York, who was [...] "from the ghetto", had tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> his life and planned to leave all of his friends behind when he returned from Thanksgiving break. He added that the student's friends' jealousy resulted in them killing the student; Jackson stated that the student's death {{was not included in the}} music video. The only case that fits these details is that of Edmund Perry. However, Perry was not killed by kids in his neighborhood; he was killed by a plainclothes police officer when Perry and his brother allegedly attacked and badly beat the officer in a mugging attempt.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the part and threw myself into it, so that {{meant a lot to}} me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bow's {{parents were}} descended from English-Irish and Scottish {{immigrants}} {{who had come}} to America the generation before.

By the time Clara was four and a half, her father was out of work, and between 1905 and 1923, the family lived at 14 different addresses, but seldom outside Prospect Heights, with Clara's father often absent. [...] "I do not think my mother ever loved my father", she said. [...] "He knew it. And it made him very unhappy, for he worshiped her, always." ...|$|E

[...] A bout of poliomyelitis left Farmer with his left leg shorter than his right leg. According to Farmer, he was nicknamed [...] "Polly the Parrot" [...] as a six-year-old because people thought he chattered away like a parrot.

By the time Eden attains the favour of the publishers and the bourgeoisie who had shunned him, he has already developed a grudge against them and become jaded by toil and unrequited love. Instead of enjoying his success, he retreats into a quiet indifference, interrupted only to rail mentally against the genteelness of bourgeois society or to donate his new wealth to working-class friends and family. He felt that people did not value him for himself or for his work but only for his fame.|$|E
2500|$|Cypress {{trees have}} long been {{associated}} with death in European culture, though {{the question of whether}} Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888, letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to [...] "funereal cypresses," [...] though this is possibly similar to saying [...] "stately oaks" [...] or [...] "weeping willows." [...] One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, [...] "The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them." [...] In the same letter he mentioned [...] "two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green." [...] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.|$|E
2500|$|Ratcliff {{has been}} {{critical}} of her character. In a 1987 interview she commented, [...] "Sue really annoys me sometimes because she's got no guts.

[...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day {{right in the middle of}} a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would screw up her nose and ask: 'What do you mean?' But she'd think about it, want to hear more and gradually begin to change her ways to become stronger, more independent! I get cheesed off with Sue. She isn't me at all." ...|$|E
