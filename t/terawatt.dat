5|$|A Carbon Trust study {{into the}} {{potential}} of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 <b>terawatt</b> hours (TW·h) per year of electric power (0.4% of total UK electric power consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings. This {{is based on the}} assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electric power, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's electric power needs by 2050.|$|E

25|$|Chirped-pulse {{amplification}} {{was originally}} introduced as {{a technique to}} increase the available power in radar in 1960. CPA for lasers was invented by Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland at the University of Rochester in the mid 1980s. Before then, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a laser pulse at intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter causes serious damage to the gain medium through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, {{some of the most}} powerful compressed CPA laser beams, even in an unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 gigawatts/cm2, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser gain medium would instantly self focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below the threshold of the nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or <b>terawatt</b> level for very large multi beam facilities.|$|E
500|$|As planned, the dam {{would have}} {{produced}} roughly 34 <b>terawatt</b> hours annually, nearly 50 times the total energy {{use for the}} entire state of Alaska in 1960 (700 gigawatt hours).

Dam proponents also suggested that the electricity might be transmitted to the rest of the United States, lowering utility prices in those states by increasing the amount of available power.

2500|$|In contrast, {{proponents of}} nuclear power argue that [...] nuclear power has killed by far the fewest number of people per <b>terawatt</b> hour of any type of power generation, {{and it has a}} very small effect on the {{environment}} with effectively zero emissions of any kind. And this even taking into account the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, in which few people were killed directly and few excess cancers will be caused by releases of radioactivity to the environment. Some proponents acknowledge that most people will not accept this sort of statistical argument nor will they believe reassuring statements from industry or government.

2500|$|In New Mexico, U.S., {{scientists}} {{tested a}} new <b>terawatt</b> laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as [...] "filaments". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, {{playing the role}} of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand. Statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed—in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels.|$|E
50|$|Major energy {{production}} or consumption is often expressed as <b>terawatt</b> hours (TW⋅h) {{for a given}} period that is often a calendar year or financial year. A 365-day year equals to 8,760 hours, therefore one gigawatt equals to 8.76 <b>terawatt</b> hours per year.

5000|$|Gérard Mourou is a French {{pioneer in}} the field of {{electrical}} engineering and lasers.

In 1994, Mourou and his team at the University of Michigan discovered that the balance between the self-focusing refraction (see Kerr effect) and self-attenuating diffraction by ionization and rarefaction of a laser beam of <b>terawatt</b> intensities in the atmosphere creates [...] "filaments" [...] which act as waveguides for the beam thus preventing divergence.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{hundreds}} of solid-state media in which laser action has been achieved, but relatively few types are in widespread use. Of these, probably the most common is neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG). Neodymium-doped glass (Nd:glass) and ytterbium-doped glasses or ceramics are used at very high power levels (<b>terawatts)</b> and high energies (megajoules), for multiple-beam inertial confinement fusion.|$|R
50|$|Argus {{was capable}} of {{producing}} {{a total of about}} 4 <b>terawatts</b> of power in short pulses of up to about 100 picoseconds, or about 2 <b>terawatts</b> of power in a longer 1 nanosecond pulse (~2 kilojoules) on a 100 micrometer diameter fusion fuel capsule target. It became the first laser to perform experiments using X-rays produced by irradiating a hohlraum. The reduced production of hard X-ray energy via the production of hot electrons while using frequency doubled and tripled laser light (as opposed to the infrared light directly produced by the laser itself) was first noticed on Argus. This technique would also be later validated in the direct drive mode (at both the LLE and Novette laser) and subsequently used to enhance laser energy to target plasma coupling efficiency in experiments on nearly all subsequent laser inertial confinement devices. Argus was shut down and dismantled in September 1981. Maximum fusion yield for target implosions on Argus was about 109 neutrons per shot.|$|R
