5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> view {{him as a}} heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people. Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded, he {{told his}} men to die as martyrs, and opened fire. His {{defiance}} and manner of his death (which stunned the traditional leadership) electrified <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people.</b> Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for the Palestinian sense of nationhood in that it brought together disparate groups against a common enemy. Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people.</b> The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E
