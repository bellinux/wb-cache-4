40|$|We discuss optimal {{fiscal policy}} in open economies, using an open-economy {{version of a}} model used in the recent work by Lucas and Stokey. An optimal allocation  smooths out the tax distortions {{associated}} with financing a given sequence of government consumption, and it also smooths out private consumption of goods and leisure by borrowing (lending) on the international capital market in periods with high (low) government consumption. The main question we ask is how the optimal policy can be made time-consistent, when usccessive governments reoptimize with respect to current and future tax rates, but most honor the government debt obligations. We show that this requires government debt of sufficiently rich maturity to be issued. First we treat a case with capital controls, where only the government can borrow and lend abroad. The there is a unique <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> for the domestic debt {{that is necessary to}} give succeeding governments incentives to continue following the optimal policy (here we interpret and extend Lucas and Stokey's results). For a small economy, this scheme is also sufficient for time-consistency, but in an economy large enough to affect its terms of trade, it is also necessary to follow a unique <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> for the government's (and the country's) foreign debt. When there are no capital controls, time-consistency is no longer a problem in a small economy. In a large economy, what matters is total government debt and total foreign debt (but not their composition), and again there are unique maturity structures necessary and sufficient for time-consistency. An interesting observation is that in the distorted world we consider, relaxing the capital controls actually deteriorates welfare...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Software {{engineers}} often {{advocate the}} importance of using Object-Oriented (OO) in developing distributed software systems. One important aspect of Distributed OO (DOO) systems is the efficient distribution of software classes among different processors. The initial design of the DOO application does not necessarily have the best class distribution and may require to be restructured. In this paper, we develop a new methodology for efficiently restructuring the DOO software in a real-time environment to fully exploit the system resources. Within the context of DOO systems, {{it is a challenge}} to perform class restructuring due to the complexity of interactions among objects. The proposed <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> achieves multi-variables objective function. The Objective function includes data communication, dependency communication and workload processing time. An additional factor is added when dealing with real time applications. We utilize an analytical DOO performance model to evaluate the objective function while preserving OO characteristics.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} problems associated with emerging chip multiprocessors (CMPs) is the management of on-chip shared cache space. Unfortunately, single processor centric data locality optimization schemes may not work well in the CMP case as data accesses from multiple cores can create conflicts in the shared cache space. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a compiler directed code <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> for enhancing locality of shared data in CMPs. The proposed scheme targets the last level shared cache that exist in many commercial CMPs and has two components, namely, allocation, which determines the set of loop iterations assigned to each core, and scheduling, which determines the order in which the iterations assigned to a core are executed. Our <b>scheme</b> <b>restructures</b> the application code such that the different cores operate on shared data blocks at the same time, to the extent allowed by data dependencies. This helps to reduce reuse distances for the shared data and improves on-chip cache performance. We evaluated our approach using the Splash- 2 and Parsec applications through both simulations and experiments on two commercial multi-core machines. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed data locality optimization scheme improves inter-core conflict misses in the shared cache by 67 % on average when both allocation and scheduling are used. Also, the execution time improvements we achieve (29 % on average) are very close to the optimal savings that could be achieved using a hypothetical scheme. Copyright 2009 ACM...|$|R

40|$|As {{the amount}} of data used by {{programs}} increases due {{to the growth of}} the hardware storage capacity, efficient memory usage is a key factor to performance. Since modern applications heavily use structures allocated in the heap, this paper particularly concentrates on the optimizations of those structures using compile-time analyses. To make optimization procedures entirely static, we propose a novel approach to represent memory access patterns with regular expressions. Repetitive accesses are usually important information for locality optimizations. The expressive power of regular expressions is appropriate to denote those repetitive accesses along with various access patterns according to the control flow of programs. By interpreting statically calculated access patterns, we choose appropriate structures for pool allocation and reorganize the field layouts of the chosen structures as well. To verify the effect of our static optimizations, we implement our analyses and optimizations based on a field <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme.</b> Our experiments with the Olden benchmarks demonstrate that the layout transformation scheme for heap objects dramatically improves cache locality by 36 % and performance by 31 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- It is {{well-known}} that maintenance and evolution represent important {{stages in the}} lifecycle of any software system, about 66 % from {{the total cost of}} the software systems development. Improving the software systems design through refactoring {{is one of the most}} important issues during the evolution of object oriented software systems. Refactoring aims at changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, but improves its internal structure. In this paper we approach the problem of adaptive refactoring, and we propose an adaptive method to cope with the evolving structure of any object oriented application. Namely, we handle here the case when new application classes are added to the software system and the current <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> must be accordingly adapted. The approach proposed in this paper extends our previous clustering based approach for identifying refactorings in an object oriented software system. We also provide an example illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach. Key–Words: Restructuring, adaptive refactoring, clustering...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the influence of the 2008 xenophobic events on the structure of earnings of street traders in inner-city Johannesburg and to provide recommendations to policymakers. Problem investigated: The xenophobic events of 2008 are well documented, but absent from the literature is the potential influence on the earnings of foreign street traders. This study investigates this influence through analysis of data from before and after the events. Design and methodology: The study applies an exploratory cross-sectional research design using data from three different samples. Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared measures are applied together with exploratory multiple linear regression analysis to generate insight into the relationships between earnings and differences by origin. Findings and implications: In 2009 the earnings structure of the sector changed. In 2008 and 2010, the earnings of foreign traders are higher, whereas in 2009 these traders earned less than local traders. It is argued that the xenophobic events might have resulted in a <b>temporary</b> <b>restructuring</b> of earnings. Originality or value of the research: This study makes a contribution through exploratory findings that document a change in the structure of earnings of foreign street traders. Conclusion: A change in the structure of earnings of foreign street traders occurred after the xenophobic events of 2008. Although association cannot ascribe causality, it is argued that this change may be related to these events. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a compile-time loop scheduling scheme and a supplementary storage reduction scheme to generate code for computer architectures which exploit fine-grain parallelism, such as superscalar, VLIW, and superpipeline machines. In {{the first part}} we propose a new loop scheduling technique based upon the notion of dataflow software pipelining. We use Petri-net theory as the modeling framework, both for describing program behavior and for proving the feasibility of our approach. The time complexity of computing a schedule for an ideal machine model is examined under various program structures; a polynomial bound is established for the scheduling approach. We then integrate resource limitations into the model and construct a unified Petri-net model for schedule generation. Simulation results are conducted {{on a number of}} Livermore loops to verify the feasibility of the approach. In the second part we discuss the application of a program <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme,</b> known as limited balancing, for storage reduction (GHW 90 a, GHW 90 b).

40|$|Reducing credit {{procyclicality}} {{represents one}} of the key challenges on the regulatory agenda to reform the financial system architecture following the banking crisis initiated in 2007. The Spanish counter-cyclical provisions scheme implemented in 2000 {{has been one of the}} main reference points in this context. The objective of the present paper is to analyze the effects of counter-cyclical provisions upon managerial discretion in loan-loss provisioning and upon loan growth. We empirically examine a sample of Spanish banks using quarterly information from 2000 Q 1 to 2010 Q 1. The results suggest that the counter-cyclical provisioning scheme has been effective in reducing the procyclicality of loan-loss provisions over time and restricting capital management. It also appears to have been effective in reducing the impact of discretional income smoothing over time. However, it did not prevent excessive lending growth in the pre-crisis period. Our findings also show that income smoothing, profit signaling and the procyclicality of loan-loss provisioning are significantly larger in banks showing higher loan growth rates before the crisis and, in particular, in those which eventually received government funding under the <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> implemented in Spain during the crisis...|$|R

Newer memories provide a structured way of storing data in multiple chips, with each chip having {{a bank of}} memory modules. Current memory-resident databases are yet {{to take full advantage}} of the banked storage system, which offers a lot of room for performance and energy optimizations. In this paper, we identify the implications of a banked memory environment in supporting memory-resident databases, and propose hardware (memory-directed) and software (query-directed) schemes to reduce the energy consumption of queries executed on these databases. Our results show that high-level query-directed schemes (hosted in the query optimizer) better utilize the low-power modes in reducing the energy consumption than the respective hardware schemes (hosted in the memory controller), due to their complete knowledge of query access patterns. We extend this further and propose a query <b>restructuring</b> <b>scheme</b> and a multi-query optimization. Queries are restructured and regrouped based on their table access patterns to maximize the likelihood that data accesses are clustered. This helps increase the inter-access idle times of memory modules, which in turn enables a more effective control of their energy behavior. This heuristic is eventually integrated with our hardware optimizations to achieve maximum savings. Our experimental results show that the memory energy reduces by 90 % if query restructuring method is applied along with basic energy optimizations over the unoptimized version. The system-wide performance impact of each scheme is also studied simultaneously...|$|R
