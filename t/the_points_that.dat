Elliott would score two wins and finish 13th in points in 2002. He scored his final career win at North Carolina in fall 2003.

25|$|In 1996, Shackley {{announced}} work {{based on}} a study of Ishi's projectile points {{and those of the}} northern tribes. He had found that points made by Ishi were not typical of those recovered from historical Yahi sites. Because Ishi's production was more typical of points of the Nomlaki or Wintu tribes and markedly dissimilar to those of Yahi, Shackley suggested that Ishi may have been only half Yahi and of mixed ancestry, related to another of the tribes. He based his conclusion on a study of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> Ishi had made compared to others held by the museum from the Yahi, Nomlaki and Wintu cultures. Among Ishi's techniques was the use of what is now known in flintknapping circles as an Ishi stick, used to run long pressure flakes. As it was a traditional technique of the Nomlaki and Wintu tribes, the finding suggests Ishi may have learned the skill directly from a male relative from one of those tribes. Also small groups, they lived close to the Yahi lands and were traditional competitors and enemies of the Yahi.|$|E
25|$|Intersection graphs: An {{interval}} graph is {{the intersection}} graph {{of a set}} of line segments in the real line. It may be given an adjacency labeling scheme in which <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> are endpoints of line segments are numbered from 1 to 2n and each vertex of the graph is represented by the numbers of the two endpoints of its corresponding interval. With this representation, one may check whether two vertices are adjacent by comparing the numbers that represent them and verifying that these numbers define overlapping intervals. The same approach works for other geometric intersection graphs including the graphs of bounded boxicity and the circle graphs, and subfamilies of these families such as the distance-hereditary graphs and cographs. However, a geometric intersection graph representation does not always imply the existence of an adjacency labeling scheme, because it may require more than a logarithmic number of bits to specify each geometric object. For instance, representing a graph as a unit disk graph may require exponentially many bits for the coordinates of the disk centers.|$|E
25|$|Zeno was {{a player}} of τάβλη (tabula), a game nearly {{identical}} to modern backgammon. (Τάβλη is still {{used to refer to}} backgammon in Greece.) In 480 he had a hand that was so unlucky that he wrote an epigram to record it; Agathias reproduced it half a century later and this allowed the game to be reconstructed in the 19th century. Zeno, who was white, had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two blots, checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. As in backgammon Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces. The white and black checkers were so distributed on <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.|$|E

25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would almost certainly be decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (<b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> were earned was {{the amount of money that}} was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the pros in that a season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by having an off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider having a great day and capturing the number one plate. Other issues like a bigger pro purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses have gone up over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} as leader, Morton had {{refused to give up}} his various {{business}} interests, including as a manager of a motor accessories distributor from 1956 until 1965 and a director of Coventry Tool and Gauge Company in 1958, among others. This led many to accuse him of not focusing on his political responsibilities, including a Sydney Morning Herald article that said called Morton a [...] "part-time" [...] leader and stated that: [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> told against Morton was his refusal to renounce or curtail his considerable business interests. In fact he increased them during the life of the last Parliament." [...] Morton's leadership was further undermined when in April 1959, Liberal backbench MP for Manly, Douglas Darby, challenged Morton for the leadership. Although Morton won the vote 22 votes to 6, the result was interpreted as only occurring because there was no other alternative to Morton. For his last few months as Leader, confidence in his leadership did not recover.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal {{received}} critical acclaim. GameSpy awarded it 5 stars out of 5, and IGN said that [...] "You MUST buy this immediately" [...] {{due to its}} extensive line-up of weaponry, high quality graphics and polished sound effects. IGN did, however, believe it was easier than the previous game, Going Commando, while GameSpot thought that the gameplay was too similar to the previous title, but both reviewers considered these as minor issues and they made little difference to the overall score. Gaming magazines GamesTM and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine both mentioned that the offbeat comedy that was apparent throughout {{the majority of the}} game was one of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> made it unique. X-Play said [...] "A mixture of excellent gameplay tweaks and new activities make the third one easily the strongest game in the series {{and one of the best}} games of this year" [...] and giving it a full five star rating. According to Metacritic's collection of reviews, 12 separate reviewers gave the game the highest possible score. In 2006, Edge Magazine featured a [...] "Time Extend" [...] article on Ratchet & Clank: Up your Arsenal and among other points, focused on the amount and variety of weapons available to the player. In August 2005 Up Your Arsenal entered the Greatest Hits line-up. Since its release, it has sold over 2.15 million copies in the US alone. IGN listed the game 18th on their list of [...] "The Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time".|$|E
