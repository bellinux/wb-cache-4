40|$|Recent {{observations}} have implicated the vomeronasal (accessory olfactory) {{system in}} the chemosensory control of rodent social behaviors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to observe the effects of peripheral vomeronasal organ extirpation on sexual behavior, aggression, and urine marking in male mice. Relative to sham-operated control animals, mice lacking vomeronasal organs displayed significantly reduced levels of copulatory behavior and intermale aggression. Urine marking rates were not reduced. The peripheral removal of the vomeronasal organ resulted in complete bilateral deafferentation of the accessory olfactory bulbs but spared the peripheral input to the main olfactory bulbs as evidenced by the lack of anterograde vomeronasal nerve transport but normal anterograde olfactory nerve transport of intranasally applied horseradish peroxidase. Neither body weights, paired testes weights, nor seminal vesicle weights of mice with vomeronasal system lesions differed significantly from those of control animals. Thus, an intact vomeronasal organ is important for <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> of sexual behavior and aggression in male mice, and the reductions in these androgen-dependent behaviors following peripheral deafferentation of the vomeronasal system cannot be attributed to a chronic reduction of gonadal hormone secretion.

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of {{terrorist}} social networks {{is essential for}} discovering knowledge about the structure {{of terrorist}} organizations. Such knowledge is important for developing effective combating strategies against terrorism. Visualization of a network using a 2 D graph can greatly facilitate the inspection of the global structure of the network {{with the support of}} the social network analysis techniques. However, its usefulness becomes limited when the size and complexity of the network increase. In this work, we study the use of two interactive visualization techniques in the visualization of complex terrorist social networks: fisheye views and fractal views. Both techniques facilitate the exploration of complex networks by allowing a user to select one or more focus points and dynamically adjusting the graph layout and abstraction level to enhance the view of regions of interest. Combining the two techniques can effectively help an investigator to recognize patterns previously unreadable in <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> due to the network complexity. Case studies are presented to illustrate how such visualization tools are capable to extract the hidden relationships among terrorists in the network through user interactions.

This film display was designed to simulate <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> available to the defending player in squash and involved the use of variable temporal cut-offs to force the subjects to use advance cues in their prediction. Systematic differences in the information pick-up of the experts and novices were observed on the film task but these differences were achieved with only relatively minor between-group variations in visual search strategy. In the second experiment, set in the natural field setting, no expert-novice differences in either fixation distribution, order, or duration were observed on a comparable prediction task.

40|$|Abstract — Virtual reality-based {{rehabilitation}} systems in-volving first-person object manipulation need {{to include}} repre-sentations of the patient’s hands and arms in the virtual envi-ronment. The virtual arms and hands should appear in the correct first-person spatial positions to allow natural interac-tion with the system. Head-mounted displays have cost and motion sickness problems even with healthy subjects, while other methods such as table-top projections have problems with image occlusion by the user’s own limbs. Here we present the first large-scale, age-matched study of a mirrored horizon-tal display which shows virtual arms in the correct position relative to the user on a table top. We compared it with a conventional display in a questionnaire and a simple arm motor task on 21 sub-acute stroke patients, 14 age-matched healthy subjects and 26 younger healthy subjects. Healthy subjects reported higher ownership of virtual arms using our display and enjoyed it more, while stroke patients preferred <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> due to comfort reasons but showed no preference in terms of enjoyment. Patients and healthy sub-jects performed the motor task equally well in the display in either the mirrored or normal positions. We conclude that our display may achieve good acceptance with stroke patients after customization to accommodate patient-specific sitting pos-tures. With these improvements it may become a valuable tool for virtual reality-based arm rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to help people read while running on a treadmill, which is {{challenging}} because runners’ eyes should adapt to vertical movements caused by running. To unload the burden of the eyes, we developed a technology, called “ReadingMate,” which basically adjusts the positions of contents (e. g., text) on a computer display along with the head movements of a runner. To explore the unknown factors contributing to the difficulty, we exhaustively reviewed related works and listed hypothetical factors. Among the factors, we chose to test the inaccurate eye compensation while running and the influence of surrounding visual cues. We first conducted a within-subject study with ten participants to evaluate the ReadingMate system. Second, to test the effectiveness of ReadingMate and the influence of visual cues from surrounding environments, we conducted a two-factor within-subject study with 20 participants. The first experiment showed that eight participants preferred the ReadingMate to <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> system. The results of second experiment showed that ReadingMate showed statistically significant effects on decreasing various adverse experiences, such as shake, dizziness, distraction, and fatigue, but we did not find evidence showing that visual cues disrupt the effects of ReadingMate. Both studies partially proved that ReadingMate could be practically useful to help runners read while running on a treadmill. Additional future research topics were also identified from interviews with participants. ...|$|E

40|$|Deciphering the {{molecular}} basis of leukocyte recruitment {{is critical to}} the understanding of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the tetraspanin CD 37 to this key process. CD 37 -deficient mice showed impaired neutrophil recruitment in a peritonitis model. Intravital microscopic analysis indicated that the absence of CD 37 impaired the capacity of leukocytes to follow a CXCL 1 chemotactic gradient accurately in the interstitium. Moreover, analysis of CXCL 1 -induced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in postcapillary venules revealed that CXCL 1 -induced neutrophil adhesion and transmigration were reduced in the absence of CD 37, consistent with a reduced capacity to undergo beta 2 integrin-dependent adhesion. This result was supported by in vitro flow chamber experiments that demonstrated an impairment in adhesion of CD 37 -deficient neutrophils to the beta 2 integrin ligand, ICAM- 1, despite <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> of high-affinity beta 2 integrins. Superresolution microscopic assessment of localization of CD 37 and CD 18 in ICAM- 1 -adherent neutrophils demonstrated that these molecules do not significantly cocluster in the cell membrane, arguing against the possibility that CD 37 regulates beta 2 integrin function via a direct molecular interaction. Moreover, CD 37 ablation did not affect beta 2 integrin clustering. In contrast, the absence of CD 37 in neutrophils impaired actin polymerization, cell spreading and polarization, dysregulated Rac- 1 activation, and accelerated beta 2 integrin internalization. Together, these data indicate that CD 37 promotes neutrophil adhesion and recruitment via the promotion of cytoskeletal function downstream of integrin-mediated adhesion...|$|E
40|$|The central {{question}} {{in this paper}} concerns the mechanism by which displays develop their species-specific sterotyped form. To this end the ontogeny of display behaviour in the black-headed gull was studied in birds kept and raised in aviaries. First it was analyzed whether the complete adult form of the display is present early in the chick, or whether it develops gradually over a longer period. Second, {{to answer the question}} whether experience with incomplete forms of display is necessary to develop the complete form, <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>display</b> development was manipulated. The descriptive part of the results deals with a detailed quantitative description of the form development in 3 agonistic displays: choking, oblique and forward, and with the development of the begging display. Data are presented concerning: ontogenetic changes in frequency of several form elements of postures and vocalizations, changes in their combinations, changes in duration of displays and changes in the context and sequences of displays. The development of these displays is summarized. Choking develops from crouching via incomplete forms of choking. First a choking-like vocalization develops in which the notes are more and more placed in a stereotyped rhythm. This call is performed by young chicks first during crouching, but later almost exclusively during choking-like postures in which the bill points downwards. During ontogeny, these bill-down postures are increasingly performed with extended carpal joints, with a tilted body, with head movements, and while standing and not hiding, in this order. From the age of two weeks on, the young regularly extend the neck upwards while choking. These postures are increasingly performed with a particular modification of the choking-like vocalization, which gradually develops to the adult long-call, typical for the adult oblique display. Two independent sound sources in the vocal apparatus of the gull seem {{to be involved in the}} development of the long-call. Early oblique-like postures are often performed with the bill held down, as in choking. Older young perform oblique-like postures more often with bill positions typical for adults, but with the neck held vertically. Young older than 10 weeks often perform normal adult oblique postures. By this time the duration of the postures has increased considerably. The sequence of the oblique with the forward, which is typical for adults, is also regularly seen from this time onwards. Begging consists of a rapid up-and-down movement of the head; during every downward movement a specific call is uttered. In very young chicks, this display is hardly distinguishable from the alert posture. During ontogeny, the duration of the pumping bouts increases, while the form changes. This change in form is due to the fact that the incomplete form of the forward becomes integrated in the begging display, while this posture also changes in form. This integration of the alert and the incomplete form of the forward is reflected by the fact that in the begging display both the call typical for the alert posture, and the call typical for the incomplete forward posture, is given. The forward develops by a gradual lowering of the head and a more pronounced extension of the neck, while the carpal joints are increasingly raised. Adult gulls often perform the posture with an upward pointed bill and a bent in the neck. In accord with data from the literature it was found that under special conditions the young chick is capable of performing adult display. As a rule, however, before the tenth week of age, young gulls show incomplete forms of display. All species-specific adult displays, postures as well as vocalizations, develop gradually towards a more complete and pronounced form. This process takes place by addition of new form elements to already existing combinations, and by changes in the form of some elements. A display can also be built upon elements of another display. Nevertheless, the development of the form of the displays cannot be attributed to an increasing amount of coordination of the different elements; only the expression of the complete pattern increases with age. For the occurrence of one form element of an adult display in the precursor display of the chick is positively correlated with the occurrence of other such elements in that incomplete display. This already is the case early in ontogeny, before the complete form is regularly performed. The adult displays are not completely fixed in their form, and the variability in some displays of adults is of the same order as in the chick. The second part of this paper deals with an experiment in which the normal course of the development of display behaviour was manipulated. Since the displays seem to develop during social interactions with parents (the begging display) or with intruders on the territory (the agonistic displays), young birds are raised in small groups with conspecifics of the same age. Agonistic- and begging interactions in these groups are rare an the development of display behaviour, both in frequency and in form, is retarded. Based on the frequency of overt aggression and on the plumage of the birds, it is likely that in these birds also the development of agonistic behaviour and the testosterone production is retarded. At the age of 15 weeks, these birds are confronted with unknown conspecifics. Although the frequency of the displays increases during the test, the form of the postures still appears to be incomplete; the birds do not seem to be able to perform complete display postures at an age at which normally raised birds perform complete display very often. Based on the data of both the descriptive study as well as the experiment, possible mechanisms for the development of display behaviour are discussed. The main items are: "imitation"; "matching" on the basis of feedback of the performed display via reactions of conspecifics or proprioceptive information and development of motivational factors including testosterone. This discussion lays the basis for a series of experiments which will be reported separately. ...|$|E
