5000|$|Their basic {{function}} is to enforce mandatory birth control on overcrowded Earth, and restrict research which might lead to dangerous weapons. In short, the ARM hunts down women who have illegal pregnancies and suppresses all new technologies. They also hunt organleggers, especially {{in the era of}} the [...] "organ bank problem". Among the many technologies they control and outlaw are all <b>trained</b> <b>forms</b> of armed and unarmed combat. By the 25th century, ARM agents were kept in an artificially induced state of paranoid schizophrenia to enhance their usefulness as law enforcement officials, which led to them sometimes being referred to as [...] "Schizes". Agents with natural tendencies toward paranoia were medicated into docility during their off duty hours, through the aforementioned science of psychistry (see Madness Has Its Place and Juggler of Worlds).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Signature {{represents}} an individual {{characteristic of a}} person {{which can be used}} for his / her validation. For such application proper modeling is essential. Here we propose an offline signature recognition and verification scheme which is based on extraction of several features including one hybrid set from the input signature and compare them with the already <b>trained</b> <b>forms.</b> Feature points are classified using statistical parameters like mean and variance. The scanned signature is normalized in slant using a very simple algorithm with an intention to make the system robust which is found to be very helpful. The slant correction is further aided by the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The suggested scheme discriminates between originals and forged signatures from simple and random forgeries. The primary objective is to reduce the two crucial parameters-False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) with lesser training time with an intension to make the system dynamic using a cluster of ANNs forming a multiple classifier system. Keywords—offline, algorithm, FAR, FRR, ANN. I...|$|E

40|$|Practice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in skill acquisition, although not all practice is of equal quality. We examined the types of team practice activities in four groups of youth cricket players. The groups were recreational- and elite-children (9 to 12 years of age) and recreational- and elite-adolescent players (13 to 17 years of age). Time motion analysis recorded the duration in two types of practice activities, namely, <b>Training</b> <b>Form</b> and Playing <b>Form.</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Form</b> is mainly drill-type activities, whereas Playing Form is mainly games-based activities. <b>Training</b> <b>Form</b> activity is thought to contain fewer opportunities to develop the perceptual, cognitive and motor skills required for successful performance in competition when compared to Playing Form. Session duration was a mean value of 95,s = 29 min. All players combined spent 69 % of session time in <b>Training</b> <b>Form</b> activity and 19 % in Playing Form, with the remaining percentage of time spent in transition between activities. Recreational-children spent around half of their time in Playing Form activity, whereas both elite and adolescent groups spent little or no time in this activity. Findings from this research highlight a gap between research and practice that may not be optimal for skill acquisition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{training}} of older employees is less effective. Training effectiveness is measured {{with respect to}} key dimensions such as career development, earnings, adoption of new skills, flexibility or job security. Older employees also pursue less ambitious goals with their training participation. An important reason for these differences during the life cycle might be that firms do not offer the “right” <b>training</b> <b>forms</b> and contents. Older employees get higher returns from informal and directly relevant training and from training contents that can be mainly tackled by crystallised abilities. Training incidence in the more effective <b>training</b> <b>forms</b> is however not higher for older employees. Given that other decisive variables on effectiveness such as training duration, financing and initiative are not sensitive to age, the wrong allocation of training contents and <b>training</b> <b>forms</b> therefore is critical for the lower effectiveness of training...|$|R
