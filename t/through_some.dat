And so the world, the religious world as well as the rest, might let Him go His way, and vanish from the eyes and minds of men, leaving behind little more than a regret that one so gifted and so fascinating should have proved--I hardly like to say the words, and yet they must be said--so unsafe and so unsound a teacher.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected {{on the promise of}} dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow <b>through.</b> <b>Some</b> of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises.

The Second War had begun in 1778, when the British responded to news of war against France by moving against French-held bases in India. Hyder Ali, then ruler of Mysore, sided with the French and marched against the British. Hyder died in 1782, and was succeeded by his son, Tippu Sultan, who continued the war <b>through</b> <b>some</b> minor campaigns until a peace treaty was signed in 1784.

Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur.

5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly <b>through</b> <b>some</b> other unknown mechanism.|$|E
