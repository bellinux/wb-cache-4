5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E
5|$|Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker {{who decided}} he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on his religion, though not before his family forced him into {{electroshock}} therapy {{to try to}} cure him. Now a tour guide in the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as he gives a tour, psychoanalyzes himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his life partner, to call his 98-year-old father, a rabbi, whom he has not seen in over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Ring's war {{service in}} the Far East meant {{that he did not}} appear in the Australian Services XI that made such an impact in England. He resumed his state cricket career in 1946–47, and made the only century of his career, 145, against Queensland at Melbourne, sharing a sixth wicket {{partnership}} of 288 runs with Sam Loxton, who made 232. The batting success was offset by less effective bowling: he took just 18 Sheffield Shield wickets, barely half the number (33) achieved by Victoria's left-arm spinner George Tribe, who was picked for three Tests against England that season, but then <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on Australian cricket and moved to England.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry {{and the players}} became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements {{in the months that}} followed, and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement. During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.|$|E
5|$|Rosas was {{determined}} to restore Argentine suzerainty over Uruguay and take revenge on Gonçalves. A series of interventions resulted. In 1839 an army led by Lavalleja, Oribe and Justo José de Urquiza, (Governor of Entre Rios) was quickly defeated by Rivera. At this point, Lavalleja <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the conflict and played no further part in the civil war. Rosas sent another army of Argentines and Uruguayans in 1845, led by Oribe and Urquiza, and this time defeated Rivera's forces, slaughtering the survivors. Rivera {{was one of the}} few who managed to escape, and went into exile in Rio de Janeiro. What remained of Rivera's Colorados held power only in the country's capital Montevideo as Oribe's forces began the Great Siege of Montevideo. The violence in Uruguay escalated, with Oribe's men killing more than 17,000 Uruguayans and 15,000 Argentinians during the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Gluck <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on Italian opera seria {{and began}} to write opéra comiques. In 1761, Gluck {{produced}} the groundbreaking ballet Don Juan {{in collaboration with the}} choreographer Gasparo Angiolini. The climax of Gluck's opéra comique writing was La rencontre imprévue of 1764. By that time, Gluck was already engaged in his operatic reforms.|$|E

He could name among his friends John Lennon, George Melly, Allen Ginsberg, Willy Russell, John Willett and Paul McCartney. Unlike McGough and Patten, Henri <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the trendier London scene, and chose {{to remain in}} Liverpool, saying there was nowhere he loved better.|$|E
25|$|Joyce {{suffered}} a unique dismissal in a 2009 Championship game against Warwickshire. He swept a ball from Ant Botha straight into short-leg fielder Jonathan Trott's pocket. Trott had <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and leapt {{out of the}} way of the ball; he was stunned to find the ball lodged in his right pocket. He became Sussex captain on 31 July 2012, succeeding Michael Yardy.|$|E

Soon after returning to Kamigata, Kunimasu <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on ukiyo-e and took up painting.

25|$|In 1993, Foreman {{received}} another title shot, {{although this}} was for the vacant WBO title. Foreman's opponent was Tommy Morrison, a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|After {{making a}} name for himself, he was scouted by Ajax. They invited the 15-year-old Benayoun and his family to the Netherlands. By his 16th birthday, he was the Ajax youth team's highest scorer and best player, and Ajax duly offered Benayoun a {{four-year}} professional contract. However, Benayoun {{and his family had}} not settled very well in Amsterdam, and so he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the contract and returned to Israel after just eight months.|$|E
