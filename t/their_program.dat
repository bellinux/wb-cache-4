5|$|And the {{impressive}} personal {{qualities of the}} Communist leaders, their seeming sincerity, and the coherence and logical nature of <b>their</b> <b>program</b> leads me, at least, toward general acceptance of the first explanation – that the Communists base their policy toward the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which there can be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social upheaval and revolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Conteh {{began working}} with the CDC and team leader Joseph B. McCormick at the Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema. Conteh became Medical Superintendent of the {{hospital}} in 1980. The Sierra Leone Civil War broke out in 1991, forcing the CDC to close <b>their</b> <b>program</b> and move to Guinea. The hospital was destroyed in the conflict {{and the spread of}} Lassa fever grew worse. During the civil war, the Natal multimammate mouse infested abandoned houses, increasing the likelihood of infection.|$|E

5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on <b>their</b> <b>program</b> {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead.

5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed <b>their</b> <b>program</b> in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E

5|$|As part of <b>their</b> <b>program</b> to {{suppress}} Polish culture, the German Nazis attempted to destroy Christianity in Poland, {{with a particular}} emphasis on the Roman Catholic Church. In some parts of occupied Poland, Poles were restricted, or even forbidden, from attending religious services. At the same time, church property was confiscated, prohibitions were placed on using the Polish language in religious services, organizations affiliated with the Catholic Church were abolished, and it was forbidden to perform certain religious songs—or to read passages of the Bible—in public. The worst conditions {{were found in the}} Reichsgau Wartheland, which the Nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti-religious policies. Polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for extermination.|$|E

25|$|Alongside, another movement, {{known as}} Red Shirts (now known as Awami National Party) {{and the people}} of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa {{interpreted}} <b>their</b> <b>program</b> in their own way. For Pashtun intelligentsia, the Red Shirts political program was based on the promotion of Pashtun culture and elimination of non-Pashtun influence in their province. For Islamic hardliners and Ulemas, <b>their</b> <b>program</b> was mainly Anti-British and their religious stand became a cause of attraction for the poor peasants which meant to check economic oppression of the British-appointed political agents. Furthermore, the strong emphasis on Pashtun identity created by Bacha Khan made it extremely difficult for Muslim League's support for the Pakistan Movement. The 'Red Shirts' and the Congress were able to contain the Muslim League to non-Pashtun regions, such as Hazara Division and Attock District.|$|E
