25|$|Knot: Some of {{the most}} common knots are the Four-in-hand, the Half-Windsor, the Windsor (often called a Full-Windsor or Double-Windsor to {{distinguish}} it from the half-Windsor) and the Shelby or Pratt. A Four-in-hand, Half-Windsor, or Windsor is generally the most appropriate with a suit, particularly by contemporary guidelines. Once properly knotted and arranged, the bottom of the tie can extend anywhere from the wearer's navel level, to slightly below the waistband. The <b>thin</b> <b>end</b> should not extend below the wide end, though this can occasionally be seen to be acceptable with thin ties.|$|E

2500|$|PCD is {{primarily}} a dance-pop and R album. Some of the songs are other genres such as post-disco. The album's opening track [...] "Don't Cha" [...] featuring Busta Rhymes was written by American songwriter and recording artist CeeLo Green. The group strut around and taunt a hapless man in its chorus: [...] "Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me/ Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me." [...] The song's is based from the chorus of [...] "Swass" [...] performed by Sir Mix-a-Lot. [...] "Beep" [...] features will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas and is built on an orchestral sample from Electric Light Orchestra's [...] "Evil Woman". The third track, features the final guest of the album, Timbaland. Lyrically the song discusses about [...] "lustful desires" [...] and suggests oral sex. [...] "Stickwitu is soul ballad that celebrate's relationship that lasts. Scherzinger voice reaches at the <b>thin</b> <b>end</b> of her alto-into-soprano register.

2500|$|American Northwest coast {{native peoples}} {{traditionally}} used adzes for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles). [...] Northwest coast adzes take two forms: hafted and D-handle. [...] The hafted form {{is similar in}} form to a European adze with the haft constructed from a natural crooked branch which approximately forms a 60% angle. [...] The <b>thin</b> <b>end</b> is used as the handle and the thick end is flattened and notched such that an adze iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with a dowel added for strength at the crook. [...] The second form is the D-handle adze which is basically an adze iron with a directly attached handle. [...] The D-handle therefore provides no mechanical leverage. [...] Northwest coast adzes are often classified by size and iron shape vs. role. [...] As with European adzes, iron shapes include straight, gutter and lipped. [...] Where larger Northwest adzes are similar in size to their European counterparts, the smaller sizes are typically much lighter such {{that they can be}} used for the detailed smoothing, shaping and surface texturing required for figure carving. [...] Final surfacing is sometimes performed with a crooked knife.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{research}} of resistance differences in winching of logs with their thicker or <b>thinner</b> <b>end</b> turned forward. Winching represents traction of wood assortments on the ground from the felling site to the forest vehicle equipped with a forest winch. The winching coefficient {{is determined by the}} horizontal tractive force and weight of the traction load. The research of resistance in winching wood assortments was carried out for the purpose of determining the size of the forest winch designed for equipping the prototype of the thinning tractor assembly (adapted farming tractor, forest semi-trailer and hydraulic crane) and developing an environmentally and economically viable technology for timber production. The research was carried out on flat forestland in a pedunculate oak stand by winching three logs of different weight. The research results have shown that the winching coefficients depend on the weight of logs, shape of log and their direction. Higher weight causes higher traction resistance. In all cases, the winching coefficients were higher in winching of logs with their thicker end turned forward. In order to achieve lower ground-based traction resistance and, at the same time, cause less damage to forest soil, winching of logs should be carried out with their <b>thinner</b> <b>end</b> turned forward...|$|R
50|$|Adults weigh 45 to 115 kg {{and stand}} 55 to 80 cm tall, with {{a length of}} 100 to 145 cm. The thin tail is 30 to 45 cm long and ends in a tuft of black hair.

Boars are {{somewhat}} larger than sows, and have distinct conical protuberances {{on either side of}} the snout and rather small, sharp tusks. The facial protuberances are bony and probably protect the boar's facial tendons during head-to-head combat with other males.|$|R
