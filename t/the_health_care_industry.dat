25|$|In {{response}} to the questions raised by {{the large amount of}} funding he took from <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry,</b> Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry</b> in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{concentration}} and internationalization of health plan companies in Brazil {{gave them a}} clearly financial face. Based {{on the need to}} understand <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry's</b> capital accumulation patterns, the current study examines health plan companies' expansion strategies through the classification of their supply and demand characteristics by recent historical periods and an analysis of recent shareholding trends in one of the leading corporations in <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> 1960 s to 2000 s witnessed changes in the scale of demands for health plans and adherence by companies to long-term accumulation strategies. Beginning in the early 21 st century, changes in the shareholding structures of the largest Brazilian company, consistent with the financialization of its accumulation regime, resulted in the rapid multiplication of its capital. Deepening segmentation of <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system in a context marked by the downturn in the national economy challenges the preservation of public subsidies for private health plans...|$|R

25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry</b> further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E

25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry</b> to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception {{that they were more}} interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
25|$|Despite this handicap, Price had out-raised {{his opponents}} by late July.

Price reclaimed his top position in the 6th district race within a few months. Federal election law put a limit of $2,000 on individual contributions to the campaigns, but Lamutt activated a clause that raised this limit to $6,000 for his opponents, when he loaned $600,000 to his own campaign. Lamutt would eventually increase this loan to $1.5 million, while Clay loaned at least $500,000 to his own campaign. In late April 2004, it was reported that Price had put a loan of $200,000 into the race - despite this disparity in self-funding, Price had received contributions from a significantly higher number of donors than his opponents. At least $300,000 of Price's campaign funds came from <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
