5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy {{about a quarter of}} the world's {{ice-free}} land with about half of these occurring in <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation {{affects the}} {{precipitation}} distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States, Midwest, the Southeast, and throughout <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> There is also evidence {{that global warming}} is leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> and subtropics.|$|E

50|$|Vehicles {{made for}} the German Africa Corps were often {{equipped}} with <b>the</b> <b>tropic</b> equipment. <b>The</b> <b>tropic</b> equipment protects <b>the</b> air filter, the carburettor and the electrics from dust. In addition to that, sand tyres are {{also a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>tropic</b> equipment. Those tyres are called Kronprinzräder.|$|R
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within <b>the</b> <b>tropics,</b> but air in <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, {{to a more}} favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|Easterly winds, on average, {{dominate}} the flow pattern across the poles, westerly winds blow across the mid-latitudes of the earth, polewards of the subtropical ridge, while easterlies again dominate <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Torrid Zone, between <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer 23.5° N and <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.|$|R
50|$|Several other leagues {{developed}} from <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> Terrors. Wicked Island Roller Derby League split from <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> Terrors in April, while the West Side Rollers, representing {{the west coast}} of the island, left later in the year, in order that it and <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> Terrors could each focus solely on a more coherent area.|$|R
50|$|The sun {{is at its}} zenith when it is 90 degrees {{above the}} horizon and this only happens between <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer and <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn.|$|R
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b>|$|E
5|$|McGill's Bellairs Research Institute, {{located in}} Saint James, Barbados , is Canada's only {{teaching}} and research facility in <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> The institute has been in use for over 50 years. Its facilities are regularly utilized by the Canadian Space Agency for research.|$|E
5|$|Other {{geographical}} features {{inside the}} park include: U-shaped valleys, 660 tropical glaciers (the largest glaciated area in <b>the</b> <b>tropics),</b> 300 glacial lakes and high plateaus intersected by ravines with torrential creeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn (or <b>the</b> Southern <b>Tropic)</b> is <b>the</b> {{circle of}} {{latitude}} {{that contains the}} subsolar point on the December (or southern) solstice. It is thus the southernmost latitude where the Sun can be directly overhead. Its northern equivalent is <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer.|$|R
50|$|The area of Earth {{located in}} between <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn {{is called the}} {{tropical}} (torrid) zone. The points on <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer are the northernmost points up to which the Sun can pass directly overhead. Similarly, the southernmost points are on <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn which follow the same criteria. Location at the north of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer shows the Sun appearing at {{the south of the}} zenith. The sunniest countries of the world are on the African continent, ranging from Somalia- Horn of Africa-, east to Niger, west and north to Egypt.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the major}} portion of earth's land {{is located in the}} Northern Hemisphere there are only four {{countries}} entirely south of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn (there are 74 countries entirely north of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer): ...|$|R
5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in <b>the</b> <b>tropics,</b> but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E

50|$|The same stick will cast no {{shadow on}} the summer {{solstice}} in the Northern Hemisphere when the subsolar point is on <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer 23.44° north of equator. Although north of 23.44°N the shadow will point towards true {{north and south of}} 23.44°N the shadow will point towards true south. The reverse occurs on the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere when the subsolar point will be on <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn 23.44°S and a vertical stick will cast no shadow along that point. But north of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn solar noon shadows will point towards true north and south of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn shadows will point towards true south.|$|R
5000|$|In {{discussing}} the habitability of lands under the Torrid Zone and Tropic of Capricorn, D'Ailly {{drew on the}} Opus Majus, written around the year 1267 English monk and scholar Roger Bacon. With regard to the Regio Patalis, Bacon said: “the southern frontier of India reaches <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn near the Region of Patale and the neighbouring lands which are washed by a great arm of the sea flowing from the Ocean”. Patala was on or just south of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer, not south of the Equator, but somehow Roger Bacon had confused <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn with <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer under which, {{on the day of}} the summer solstice, shadows at Patala were cast southward.|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> {{there is}} little {{variation}} in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses are used in <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> {{although there are many}} species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.|$|E
5000|$|Solar noon (informally high noon) is {{the moment}} when the Sun {{contacts}} the observer's meridian, reaching its highest position above the horizon on that day ("Sun transit time"). This is also the origin of the terms ante meridiem (a.m.) and post meridiem (p.m.), as noted below. The Sun is directly overhead at solar noon at the Equator on the equinoxes, at <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer (latitude [...] N) on the June solstice and at <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn ( [...] S) on the December solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere, north of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer, <b>the</b> Sun is due south of the observer at solar noon; in the Southern Hemisphere, south of <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn, it is due north.|$|R
50|$|The north {{temperate}} zone {{extends from}} <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer (approximately 23.5° north latitude) to the Arctic Circle (approximately 66.5° north latitude). The south temperate zone extends from <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn (approximately 23.5° south latitude) to the Antarctic Circle (at approximately 66.5° south latitude).|$|R
50|$|Many Nepalese conflate this festival {{with the}} Winter Solstice, {{and believe that}} the sun ends its southward journey (Sanskrit: Dakshinayana) at <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn, and starts moving northward (Sanskrit: Uttarayaana) towards <b>the</b> <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer, {{in the month of}} Poush on this day in mid-January.|$|R
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the antbirds is entirely Neotropical, with {{the vast majority of}} the species being found in <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the barred antshrike, have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and Middle American {{distribution of}} the family; others, such as the ash-throated antwren, have a tiny distribution.|$|E
5|$|The jacanas are a {{group of}} {{tropical}} waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.|$|E
5|$|The tanagers are a {{large group}} of small to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds restricted to the New World, mainly in <b>the</b> <b>tropics.</b> Many species are brightly colored. They are seed eaters, but their preference tends towards fruit and nectar. Most have short, rounded wings.|$|E
