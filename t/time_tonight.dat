2500|$|At the Sydney concert, Peter Trotter, playing {{saxophone}} for Mental As Anything, {{collapsed on}} stage and died a week later. The tour had a budget of $3.25 million, and was announced with claims of Australian mateship and cooperation; however arguments ensued between various band managers over the proposed concert series film. The tour ended in acrimony with two managers, Chris Murphy (for INXS) and Jeremy Fabinyi (for Mental As Anything), arguing backstage in Sydney and coming to blows. A film of the tour, , directed by Richard Lowenstein, was released in July 1987, but contained no footage of Mental As Anything performing. Rock historian Glenn A. Baker and Bob King wrote Australian Made, Gonna Have a Good <b>Time</b> <b>Tonight</b> : The Authorised Documentary of the Event in 1987 with detailed notations by Baker and photographs by King. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, [...] "the tour drew record crowds across the country. It was the first travelling festival tour to feature exclusively Australian bands".|$|E

[...] Kennicott was upon his back, {{flapping}} {{his hands in}} the earnest effort to be a seal, thrilled by the strength with which his son kicked him. He slipped his arm about Carol's shoulder; he went down to supper rejoicing that he was cleansed of perilous stuff. While Carol was putting the baby to bed he sat on the front steps.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] groaned the Admiral; [...] "by one {{of those}} brutal {{accidents}} on which are built all the lying mythologies of mankind, they were both shipwrecked. My father, coming up this coast out of the Atlantic, was washed up on these Cornish rocks. My brother's ship was sunk, no one knows where, on the voyage home from Tasmania. His body was never found. I tell you it was from perfectly natural mishap; lots of other people besides Pendragons were drowned; and both disasters are discussed in a normal way by navigators. But, of course, it set this forest of superstition on fire; and men saw the flaming tower everywhere. That's why I {{say it will be}} all right when Walter returns. The girl he's engaged to was coming today; but I was so afraid of some chance delay frightening her that I wired her not to come till she heard from me. But he's practically sure to be here some <b>time</b> <b>tonight,</b> and then it'll all end in smoke--tobacco smoke. We'll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle of this wine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So far," [...] he said, [...] "our night {{has been}} eminently successful. No harm {{has come to}} us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first, and perhaps our most {{difficult}} and dangerous, step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari, that the brute beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power, for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears, and that monster [...] . He has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last <b>time</b> <b>tonight.</b> So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we {{have reason to be}} content with our first night's work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril, but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink." ...|$|E
