40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role that {{self-determination}} played in the transition process for <b>young</b> African American <b>women</b> with disabilities who exited high school with a special diploma and participated in a local transition program. Factors under study included <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy, self-regulation, psychological empowerment, and self-realization (Wehmeyer, 1996). This examination of the perceptions of the transition process of <b>young</b> African American <b>women</b> with disabilities involved in-depth interviews with five <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and their parent or guardian. Additionally, The Arc 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Determination Scale (ASDS) and the Parent Self-Determination Practice Survey (PSDPS) were administered to determine the level of self-determination of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> as well as the level of parental promotion of self-determination. Results showed that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> were able to use self-determination in a variety of settings. Three of the five student participants demonstrated high levels of self-determination as measured by the ASDS when compared to the normative sample. Also, the parent or guardian of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> provided multiple opportunities for <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> to practice self-determination in their homes and employment settings. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> discussed several factors that they perceived to be strengths and challenges to using self-determination throughout and beyond the transition process. The findings have implications for school systems, social service agencies, and parents and guardians...|$|R

While dying, Malth reveals that he was the one who dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive and that Ryu will meet him as he presses onward. When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers that his father was not killed but was instead possessed by an evil figure. He destroys the evil figure, which releases Ken from its hold. Jaquio, enraged from Ken's release from the possession, shows himself; he immediately tries to kill Ryu with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Jaquio is killed during the ensuing fight by Ryu, but then a lunar eclipse occurs, causing the demon statues to transform into Jashin.

5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> as Maria.|$|E

The study is based on a narrative method and the theoretical framework is founded on Goffman’s role theory; Goffman’s theory of social stigma and the concept of shame. The result of the study shows among other things that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> often describe themselves as disgusting, filthy and have feelings of self- hatred and shame. They self-harm through sexual intercourse or acts as a way to regulate and relieve anxiety, but it only helps in the short run as the anxiety tends to get even stronger than before which leads to more self-harm. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> often end up in a vicious circle that is hard to break. Furthermore <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> describe their upbringings lacking the presence and love of their parents. ...|$|R
