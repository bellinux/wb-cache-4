They have a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{taken up by the}} lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Konrad von Wallenrode (c. 1330s - 23 July 1393) was the 24th Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, serving from 1391 to 1393. Modern {{sources are}} {{friendly}} towards Konrad, although they claim he was hot-blooded, proud, and had <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cruel.|$|R

5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of human capital in firm valuation is something Huang and Wang {{points out in}} there paper from 2008. We expand Ohlson’s valuation model (1995) in line with Huang and Wang (2008) to enhance a market value that includes proxies for human capital. By using human capital based market value and one of Francis, Nanda and Olsson’s (2008) version of earnings quality, we create a value table which aim to sort for undervalued and overvalued companies during the  economic upswing of 2003 to 2007 in the human capital line of business.

5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E
5|$|Pedro's {{character}} {{was marked by}} an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women {{in addition to his}} hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as JoãoVI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, daughter of Emperor FranzI of Austria (formerly FranzII, Holy Roman Emperor).|$|E
5|$|While Heman {{remained}} in Salisbury, where {{he ran a}} general store {{until his death in}} 1778, Allen's movements {{over the next few years}} are poorly documented. He is known to have been living in Northampton, Massachusetts in the spring of 1766, where his son Joseph was born, and where he invested in a lead mine. He was asked to leave Northampton in July 1767 by the authorities; while no official reason is known, biographer Michael Bellesiles suggests that religious differences and Allen's <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disruptive may have played a role in his departure. He then briefly returned to Salisbury before settling in nearby Sheffield, Massachusetts with his younger brother Zimri. It is likely that his first visits to the New Hampshire Grants occurred during these years. While Sheffield would be the family home for ten years, Allen was often absent for extended periods.|$|E

50|$|While flint {{may be used}} in fire-lighting, {{it should}} not <b>be</b> exposed <b>to</b> {{excessive}} heat, as from a fire. Due to uneven expansion, flint may fracture, sometimes violently, during heating. This <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> fracture <b>is</b> enhanced by the fact that most samples of flint contain impurities that may expand {{to a greater or lesser}} degree than the surrounding stone. This <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> fracture <b>is</b> similar, but not identical, <b>to</b> the <b>tendency</b> of glass <b>to</b> shatter when exposed to heat.|$|R
50|$|In social psychology, group {{polarization}} refers <b>to</b> the <b>tendency</b> for a {{group to}} make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. These more extreme decisions are towards greater risk if individuals' initial <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> risky and towards greater caution if individuals' initial <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cautious. The phenomenon also holds that a group's attitude toward a situation may change {{in the sense that}} the individuals' initial attitudes have strengthened and intensified after group discussion, a phenomenon known as attitude polarization.|$|R
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
