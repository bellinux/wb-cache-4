5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
5|$|Contested between 9 and 19 March 1995, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships is <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> venue, and {{the only}} major world {{championship}} to be contested in Northern Ontario. The Nordic combined individual took place on 9 March, and was won by Fred Børre Lundberg ahead of Jari Mantila. The following day saw Japan win ahead of Norway and Finland in the Nordic combined team event. In ski jumping, the individual normal hill event took place on 12 March, which saw a double Japanese victory with Takanobu Okabe winning ahead of Hiroya Saito. The team event in the large hill on 16 March saw Finland win ahead of Germany and Japan. In the large hill individual event on 18 March, Tommy Ingebrigtsen set a new hill record and won ahead of Andreas Goldberger.|$|E

25|$|The Cougar is a twin-engined low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane using a honeycomb and bonded {{metal construction}} that is <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line since the BD-1. The prototype's single spar wing was upgraded to a double-spar configuration and this allowed a wet wing.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{condition}} is a sunken {{appearance of the}} sternum. The most common form is a cup-shaped concavity, involving {{the lower end of}} the sternum; also a broader concavity involving the upper costal cartilages is possible. The lower-most ribs may protrude ("flared ribs"). Pectus excavatum defects may be symmetric or asymmetric.|$|E
25|$|The {{sheer size}} of the displacement—the largest {{migration}} of children in history—and the degree of exploitation that occurred, gave rise to new agencies {{and a series of}} laws that promoted adoption arrangements rather than indenture. <b>The</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period is Minnesota's adoption law of 1917 which mandated investigation of all placements and limited record access to those involved in the adoption.|$|E
5000|$|The BBC {{claimed that}} the attack [...] "bore all <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Haqqani network". The ISAF claimed a week later that it had {{captured}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid's planners.|$|R

5000|$|Common {{themes in}} the series are betting, gender-specific differences, and Atze Schröder's drive for profit. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, above all, is that almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} speak [...] "Ruhrdeutsch".|$|R
25|$|The front {{exterior}} {{entrance to}} the Dakin building originally featured a large stone sculpture of a teddy bear, hewn from natural stone. This bear became <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high-tech building embodying the playful spirit of the R. Dakin designers and the avant-gard character of the building. The bear is designed {{in the manner of}} Benny Bufano by sculptor Judith Lord. When Hogan sold the Dakin Building in 1995, he retained ownership rights to the bear.|$|E
25|$|The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom {{was partly}} {{intended}} to demonstrate mass {{support for the}} civil rights legislation proposed by President Kennedy in June. Martin Luther King and other leaders therefore agreed to keep their speeches calm, also, to avoid provoking the civil disobedience which had become <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Rights Movement. King originally designed his speech as a homage to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, timed to correspond with the 100-year centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E
25|$|Marian devotions were <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pontificate of Pope John Paul II and he reoriented the Catholic Church {{towards the}} renewal of Marian veneration. In March 1987 he went further than Paul VI in {{extending}} the Catholic views on Mary beyond Vatican II by issuing the encyclical Redemptoris Mater. Rather than being just a new presentation of the Marian views of Vatican II, Redemptoris Mater was in many aspects a re-reading, re-interpretation and further extension of the teachings of Vatican II.|$|E
50|$|By 800 BCE, <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tlatilco culture fade {{from the}} archaeological record. By 700 BCE, Cuicuilco {{had become the}} largest and most dynamic city in <b>the</b> Valley <b>of</b> Mexico, eclipsing Tlatilco and Tlapacoya.|$|R

50|$|Noir is <b>the</b> protagonist <b>of</b> Keillors book Guy Noir and the Straight Skinny, {{where he}} falls in with Naomi Fallopian and her get-rich-quick diet pill scheme. The story has many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio dramas.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace, {{not just}} in the Manueline era but in all its history, was its Tower of the King, in the {{southern}} wing. During the Manueline era, the Casa da Índia was installed in the tower, which hoisted a large sculpture of the Royal Coat of Arms of Portugal on the exterior of the tower, facing the river. Starting in 1525, King John III sponsored a set of enlargements and renovations to the palace, which, most notably, altered the Tower of the King, expanding it and opening a large balcony, faced towards the Tagus.|$|E
25|$|Though the Soviet {{operation}} at Korsun {{did not result}} in the collapse in the German front that the Soviet command had hoped for, it marked a significant deterioration in the strength available to the German army on that front, especially in heavy weaponry, nearly all of which was lost during the breakout. Through the rest of the war the Red Army would place large German forces in jeopardy, while the Germans were stretched thin and constantly attempting to extract themselves from one crisis to the next. Mobile Soviet offensives were <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern front {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jemdet Nasr Period is its {{distinctive}} painted monochrome and polychrome pottery. Designs are both geometric and figurative; the latter displaying trees and {{animals such as}} birds, fish, goats, scorpions, and snakes. Nevertheless, this painted pottery makes up {{only a small percentage}} of the total assemblage and at various sites it has been found in archaeological contexts suggesting that it was associated with high-status individuals or activities. At the site of Jemdet Nasr, the painted pottery was found exclusively in the settlement's large central building, which is thought to have played a role in the administration of many economic activities. Painted Jemdet Nasr Period pots were found in similar contexts at Tell Fara and Tell Gubba, both in the Hamrin Mountains.|$|E

25|$|The ITU {{executive}} council subsequently required president Robert McMichen {{to enter into}} merger talks with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. IBT President Jackie Presser spoke of merger with the ITU; at the 1983 San Francisco ITU convention. ITU President Joe Bingle risked his leadership post on the ITU-IBT merger and lost. However, the ITU's 74,000 members turned down the merger two-to-one in a vote taken in 1985, fearing that the Teamsters could not be trusted to respect {{the terms of the}} merger agreement—which included <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ITU: autonomy. The Mailers would later join the Teamsters; the Printers would not. The last ITU convention was held in 1984 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. By 1986, the ITU had only 44,000 active members.|$|E
25|$|The VFA {{was formed}} in 1877 and is the second-oldest Australian rules {{football}} league, replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{early years of the}} game. Initially serving a primarily administrative function, the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896. The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL. From 1897 until 1995, the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria's secondary senior club competition. Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL, the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules, and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays {{at a time when the}} VFL was played solely on Saturdays.|$|E
25|$|The fixture {{survived and}} managed to {{struggle}} through the 1820s and 1830s when {{it was necessary to}} handicap the Players to give the Gentlemen a competitive chance. It became annual (often played more than once per season) from 1829. The teams were evenly matched in the early 1840s when Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix were in the Gentlemen team but then, of the 25 matches from July 1844 to July 1865, the Players won 23 with one draw and only one defeat. In 1865, W. G. Grace came into the Gentlemen team and the picture changed completely with the Gentlemen dominant for the next twenty years. From the mid-1880s, the batsmen on each side were usually strong but <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Players from that time became their greater strength in bowling and fielding, areas in which the Gentlemen were relatively weak after Grace was past his best.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bond films, largely {{derived from}} {{production}} designer Ken Adam, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bond film series, and <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> {{his work on}} Dr. No's lair {{can be seen in}} another film he worked on, Dr. Strangelove.|$|R
50|$|Teaching {{students}} to write well is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school's curriculum. In the Upper School, students are instructed across disciplines in <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analytical and personal essay, with special emphasis placed on the organization and craft of a well-written argument.|$|R
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strip is {{its use of}} {{real people}} and locations.

25|$|The {{term was}} made popular in a posthumously {{published}} work by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1836), {{and it was}} long considered that all the indigenous languages of the Americas were of the same type. Humboldt considered language structure to be {{an expression of the}} psychological stage of evolution of a people, and since Native Americans were considered uncivilized, polysynthesis came to be seen as the lowest stage of grammatical evolution, characterized by a lack of rigorous rules and clear organization known in European languages. Duponceau himself had argued that the complex polysynthetic nature of American languages was a relic of a more civilized past, and that this suggested that the Indians of his time had degenerated from a previous advanced stage. Duponceau's colleague Albert Gallatin contradicted this theory, arguing rather that synthesis was a sign of a lower cultural level, and that while the Greek and Latin languages were somewhat synthetic, Native American languages were much more so - and consequently polysynthesis was <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest level of intellectual evolution.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neuroacanthocytosis syndromes is the {{presence}} of acanthocytes in peripheral blood. Acanthocytosis originated from the Greek word acantha, meaning thorn. [...] Acanthocytes are spiculated red blood cells and can be caused by altered distribution of membrane lipids or membrane protein/skeleton abnormalities. [...] In neuroacanthocytosis, acanthocytes are caused by protein but not lipid membrane abnormalities ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics also}} {{recognized}} the film's ability {{to appeal to}} various age groups, specifically children and adults. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest children's films. It also {{has the kind of}} spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids." ...|$|E
5000|$|The 2010 Rockstar Games release [...] "Red Dead Redemption" [...] {{features}} a river {{inspired by the}} San Luis Rey.
