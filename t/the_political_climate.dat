5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the century, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> in Europe was feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and the myth of Brixia magnipotens shattered. A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a {{phenomenon}} that would affect the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> in the {{aftermath}} of Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> was {{changing}} and {{the ban on}} forming veterans' associations had been lifted. Encouraged by the shifting tone of the World War II discourse and the courting of the Wehrmacht veterans by the West German government and political parties, former Waffen-SS members came forward to campaign for their rights.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> in New South Wales {{became more}} {{volatile}} after Lang's attempts {{to abolish the}} Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E
5|$|During the Obama presidency, some {{progressive}} {{lawyers and}} activists called for Ginsburg to retire so Obama {{would be able}} to appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate. They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain. Ginsburg rejected these pleas. She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties. Moreover, Ginsburg opined that <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's highly popular {{presidency}} in 1951, Árbenz {{was elected to the}} presidency. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land reform program known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Due to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> of the Cold War, the US was already predisposed to see the socialist policies of the democratically elected Arévalo and Árbenz as communist. This conception had been strengthened by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion, and by the 1950s the US government was considering overthrowing Árbenz.|$|E
5|$|His {{expenditures}} {{in trying to}} remold Hawaii's monarchy into the European model added to the public debt, helping to increase the kingdom's expenditures on the monarchy by 50%. Kalākaua decided to have the coronation he had previously been denied due to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> when he was elected. On the 1883 anniversary of his 9th year in office, an elaborate public coronation ceremony was held at expenses exceeding $50,000. Kalākaua crowned himself. In 1886, Kalākaua's two-week 50th birthday Jubilee added more expense, reported by Harper's Weekly to be $75,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> in Italy (under Mussolini) became {{unacceptable}} to Escher. He {{had no interest}} in politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} {{gradually}} close the tramway. New trams had been delivered in 1958, {{and it was}} decided that lines would only be closed as trams were naturally retired. At the time Oslo Sporveier had 421 vehicles. By 1974, the company had 163 vehicles, of which 100 were powered trams, 43 were trailers and 20 were working trailers. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> changed, and in 1977 the city council decided to not close the tramway anyway. Between 1978 and 1981, ten tram vehicles were bought from the Gothenburg Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Interrupted by {{a general}} {{election}} in June 1790, the committee finally finished hearing witnesses, and in April 1791 with a closely reasoned four-hour speech, Wilberforce introduced the first parliamentary bill to abolish the slave trade. However, after two evenings of debate, the bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> having swung in a conservative direction {{in the wake of}} the French Revolution and in reaction to an increase in radicalism and to slave revolts in the French West Indies. Such was the public hysteria of the time that even Wilberforce himself was suspected by some of being a Jacobin agitator.|$|E
5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> and {{revolutions}} in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the hardiness of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, that allowed him to cope so well with the accident.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} from Maranhão, Caxias saw that <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> had changed. Francisco de Lima's Liberal Party had pushed through the {{premature}} declaration of the Emperor's majority on 23 July 1840. In May 1842, the Liberals rebelled in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais {{in retaliation for the}} Emperor's decision—on the advice of a Council of State dominated by Reactionaries—to call for new elections, annulling the previous election tainted by widespread fraud by the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> {{prevailing}} <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> at <b>the</b> time of {{the election}} was also a major factor. Voter anger was targeted against the GOP, and many Democrats once considered vulnerable managed to hold on.|$|R
500|$|In 1991, Card {{made several}} minor changes to reflect <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climates</b> of <b>the</b> time, {{including}} {{the decline of}} the Soviet Union. In the afterword of Ender in Exile (2008), Card stated that many of the details in chapter 15 of Ender's Game were modified for use in the subsequent novels and short stories. [...] In order to more closely match the other material, Card has rewritten chapter 15, and plans to offer a revised edition of the book.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to several}} factors, {{including}} <b>the</b> tense <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> of <b>the</b> 1950s and poor cotton sales at Providence, cooperative efforts were abandoned around 1956, {{and pieces of}} the land were sold off to members.|$|R
5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to shut the media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat as well as <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate</b> regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements {{in favor of a}} twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E
5|$|In June 1453, Somerset {{was granted}} {{custody of the}} lordship of Glamorgan – part of the Despenser {{heritage}} held by Warwick until then – and open conflict broke out between the two men. Then, {{in the summer of}} that year, King Henry fell ill. Somerset was a favourite of the king and Queen Margaret, and with the king incapacitated he was virtually in complete control of government. This put Warwick at a disadvantage in his dispute with Somerset, and drove him into collaboration with York. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>climate,</b> influenced by the , then started turning against Somerset. On 27March 1454, a group of royal councillors appointed the Duke of York protector of the realm. York could now count on the support not only of Warwick, but also of Warwick's father Salisbury, who had become more deeply involved in disputes with the Percys in the north of England.|$|E
