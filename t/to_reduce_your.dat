We have seen a recurrent tendency in media and society that encourage people to overlook their social media use and seen cases of people reducing their private social media use. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine attitudes in young adults whom have taken a break from social media or reduced their usage. Furthermore, we wanted to distinguish what types of strategies they have used when they renounced from social media. With a qualitative approach we interviewed five young adults that had waived from social media during different periods of time due to negative usage experiences. We examined our empirical material along side with previous research on social media, Goffman’s impression management theory and Nanna Gillberg’s notion on Bourdieu’s forms of capital. We found that people tend to see the opportunity of impression control as something tedious and time consuming which had lead to a diminished use of social media.

Many of us are even striving for carbon neutrality under the President’s Climate Commitment. To meet these targets we take measures <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> our footprints, or do “less bad”. In this situation, we often {{reach a point where}} no more reductions are possible, and to meet our targets we need to consider purchasing offsets or renewable energy credits. But instead of spending money in these abstract ways that leave very little room for student interaction, could we focus on doing “more good” – identifying ways we can improve the environment and the community around us? Could we use the money spent on traditional offset programs to support these projects? And, can we somehow quantify these impacts and include them as part of a holistic “less bad and more good” sustainability strategy? These are the questions this workshop will explore. Two thought leaders in this space will give a short presentation on the ways they are thinking beyond offsets, from calculating and flourishing your handprint in addition <b>to</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>your</b> footprint <b>to</b> onsetting instead of offsetting travel emissions to have real impacts in local communities. Then we will spend the remainder of the workshop brainstorming and discussing how we might apply these concepts to rethink our own approaches to offsetting campus emissions.
