40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} effects of President Clinton's {{leadership}} and communication skills on the attitudes of women voters. A review of literature related to leadership styles/skills and methods of communication was completed and then applied to a case study of President Clinton's presidency. The related literature as applied to President Clinton's presidency was analyzed within the context of three illustrations: (1.) Public Policy [...] the Family and Medical Leave Act; (2.) Presidential Appointments [...] Donna Shalala, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services; and (3.) Voting Base/Campaign Activities [...] Gender Gap in the 1996 Election. Case study analysis reveals <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> utilized his leadership and communication skills to lobby women voters through policy initiatives and presidential appointments, and, in doing so, gained their support in the 1996 election.

40|$|In April 1996, the United States (US) {{added the}} Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant {{to the list}} of {{facilities}} eligible for the application of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. At that time, the US proposed that the IAEA carry out a Verification Experiment at the plant with respect to the downblending of about 13 metric tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the form of UF{sub 6 }. This material is part of the 226 metric tons of fissile material <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> declared to be excess to US national-security needs and which will be permanently withdrawn from the US nuclear stockpile. In September 1997, the IAEA agreed to carry out this experiment, and during the first three weeks of December 1997, the IAEA verified the design information concerning the downblending process. The plant has been subject to short-notice random inspections since December 17, 1997. This paper provides an overview of the Verification Experiment, the monitoring technologies used in the verification approach, and some of the experience gained to date...|$|E

50|$|Owen was {{nominated}} on May 9, 2001 by President George W. Bush {{to fill a}} vacancy on the Fifth Circuit created by Judge William Lockhart Garwood, who had taken senior status on January 23, 1997. Senate Democrats immediately decided to block her nomination for two reasons. First, the Democrats were angry that two previous nominees <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> nominated to Garwood's empty seat, Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno, were never given hearings by the United States Senate during Clinton's second term because the Senate {{was at the time}} controlled by Republicans. Second, they considered her to be too conservative. As a result, the Senate Democrats, who controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 107th Congress did not let Owen's nomination come up for a vote. In 2003, after Republicans had taken the Senate back, Democrats filibustered her. In 2005, after Republicans picked up four more seats in the Senate during the 109th Congress her nomination was again considered.|$|R

50|$|During the Clinton Administration, Wheeler {{traveled}} to Asia and investigated the China-Democratic National Committee fundraising scandal. Many of his reports {{during this period}} were used in criminal prosecutions, congressional investigations and hearings, and were recognized by members of Congress as the catalysts for their investigations. Wheeler produced the documentary Trading with the Enemy: How the Clinton Administration Armed China that presented evidence <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> decontrolled dangerous military technology to The People’s Republic of China while receiving illegal donations from operatives from PRC.In 2003, Wheeler’s reportage led to the exposure of a foreign agent from China operating inside the U.S. posing as a college student.In 2008, Wheeler created the National Republican Trust PAC. In 2009, Wheeler co-authored, along with Dr. Peter Leitner, the book Shadow Government: What Obama Doesn’t Want You To Know About His Czars. In 2012 Wheeler wrote the book, Promoting Decline: Obama vs. America.

50|$|Capturing Osama bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the United States government since the presidency of Bill Clinton. Shortly after the September 11 attacks it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> signed a directive authorizing the CIA (and specifically their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend bin Laden and bring him to the United States to stand trial after the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Africa; if taking bin Laden alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized. On August 20, 1998, 66 cruise missiles launched by United States Navy ships in the Arabian Sea struck bin Laden's training camps near Khost in Afghanistan, narrowly missing him by a few hours. In 1999 the CIA, together with Pakistani military intelligence, had prepared a team of approximately 60 Pakistani commandos to infiltrate Afghanistan to capture or kill bin Laden, but the plan was aborted by the 1999 Pakistani coup d'état; in 2000, foreign operatives working {{on behalf of the}} CIA had fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a convoy of vehicles in which bin Laden was traveling through the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles but not the one in which bin Laden was riding.|$|R

In a GOP debate in Iowa on January 13, Dornan called Clinton a [...] "criminal" [...] and a [...] "pathological liar." [...] When asked why voters should choose Dornan over his Republican rivals to challenge Clinton in the general election, he argued that he had more children and grandchildren than the others, with only Indiana Senator Richard Lugar coming anywhere near him on that score.

2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill <b>Clinton</b> did not <b>have</b> a {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, he stated <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> did <b>have</b> a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the <b>Clinton</b> administration <b>had</b> no overall plan on al-Qaeda {{to pass on to}} the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|R
2500|$|Brown figured {{prominently}} {{in two ways}} in the Whitewater controversy of the Clinton presidential administration. Brown was investigating Clinton. Brown was contacted by David Hale, a municipal judge facing indictment for fraud, then functioning as a paid informant for the FBI.

At {{the same time that}} Brown was investigating the Clintons, he was using the tax-exempt status of Citizens United to acquire funds, urging his donors to fill out an [...] "emergency impeachment" [...] survey, utilizing a push-poll technique. Brown's fundraising literature said, [...] "Our top investigator, David Bossie, is on the inside directing the probe as Special Assistant to U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth on the U.S. Senate Whitewater Committee." ...|$|R

He of all people should know better {{because he was the}} target of exactly the same kind of tactics." [...] McPeak also compared the former President's comments to McCarthyism: [...] "I grew up, I was going to college when Joe McCarthy was accusing good Americans of being traitors, so I've had enough of it." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the often}} heated debate over {{campaign}} finance reform, few events have generated more heat than Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's selection of Professor Bradley A. Smith for a GOP {{seat on the}} Federal Election Commission. Critics called Smith, a noted expert on campaign finance, "unfit" to serve, his selection "an insult. " Someone on the FEC with his views, said one critic, is "unthinkable. " Given <b>that</b> opposition, <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> thus far refused to nominate Smith. In response, the GOP has put a hold on Clinton's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations. What is Smith's "crime"? In his scholarly writings, he has challenged the conventional wisdom by arguing that past campaign finance reforms have made the system worse and that most proposed reforms {{would do the same}} [...] and, more important, would violate the First Amendment. He urges an end to limits on both contributions and spending [...] but with full disclosure. Although Smith's critics call him "radical," their attack has raised a question: Just who is the radical? For in case after case, the courts have been on Smith's side, not {{on the side of his}} critics. Indeed, what his critics plainly fear is that Smith, on the FEC, will not be "radical" enough, will not press the "robust enforcement" the courts have repeatedly struck down. For his part, Smith has said he will enforce the law, but he will not waste the tax-payers' money pursuing unconstitutional enforcement theories. His selection is a breath of fresh air that should bring needed balance to the campaign finance debate...|$|R

Soon though Muller headed north to San Francisco and KYLD-FM, [...] "Wild 107". Now going by his old college nickname Mancow, in 1993 Muller made national headlines with a publicity stunt that caused a major traffic headache for the City by the Bay. Reacting to a story (later discovered as unsubstantiated) <b>that</b> <b>President</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> would <b>have</b> tied up air traffic at Los Angeles International Airport {{for over an hour}} while getting a haircut from celebrity hairstylist Cristophe aboard Air Force One, Muller staged a parody of the incident on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge during rush hour. He used vans to block the westbound lanes on the bridge while his then sidekick, Jesus [...] "Chuy" [...] Gomez, got a haircut. As a result of the publicity stunt, Muller was charged with creating a public nuisance. He entered a no contest plea; his sentence included three years probation, a $500 fine and 100 hours of community service. The radio station settled a civil suit by paying $1.5 million, including $500,000 to cover three toll-free days on the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Specter led Sestak by {{more than}} 20 {{percentage}} points {{for most of the}} race and, while Sestak struggled to overcome problems from his low name recognition, Specter received endorsements from major Democratic figures and influential organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee. Specter's lead narrowed significantly in the final month of the campaign, when Sestak concentrated his funds and efforts on television commercials that questioned Specter's Democratic credentials. As the race progressed, Specter grew more strongly critical of Sestak, attacking his House attendance record, accusing Sestak of failing to pay his staffers minimum wage, and claiming Sestak was demoted in the Navy for creating a [...] "poor command climate". On May 18, Sestak ended Specter's nearly 30-year Senate career by earning 53.8 percent of the primary vote, to Specter's 46.2 percent. Political observers said the commercials played a major part in Sestak's victory, and that a national swing in momentum toward Republicans and against incumbents ultimately harmed Specter's chances. During the primary campaign, it was revealed <b>that</b> former <b>President</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> offered Sestak a position in the Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy. This drew allegations from Republicans that the administration violated federal statues forbidding government employees from interfering with a Senate election, but no formal investigation was ever held.|$|R
