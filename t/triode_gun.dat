40|$|The 2856 -MHz direct {{bunching}} of {{a conventional}} <b>triode</b> electron <b>gun</b> (<b>Triode</b> RF <b>Gun)</b> is currently investigated. In this scheme, an efficient feeding of RF power to the cathode-grid assembly(Y- 824, provided by CPI Eimac) is critical for the proper operation of the gun. Because the capacitance of the Y- 824 is quite large (∼ 24 pF), much portion of incident RF power will be reflected back. In order to overcome this problem, a resonant cavity was considered instead of conventional impedance-matching network. In this article, we present the design concepts and procedure of the resonant cavity; First, we neglect the beam loading to analytically calculate {{the length of the}} cavity for resonance.

40|$|Purpose: MRI-linac {{therapy is}} {{a rapidly growing}} field, and {{requires}} that conventional linear accel- erators are operated with the fringe field of MRI magnets. One of the most sensitive accelerator components is the electron gun, which serves {{as the source of}} the beam. The purpose of this work was to develop a validated finite element model (FEM) model of a clinical triode (or gridded) electron gun, based on accurate geometric and electrical measurements, and to characterize the performance of this gun in magnetic fields. Methods: The geometry of a Varian electron gun was measured using 3 D laser scanning and digital calipers. The electric potentials and emission current of these guns were measured directly from six dose matched true beam linacs for the 6 X, 10 X, and 15 X modes of operation. Based on these measurements, a finite element model (FEM) of the gun was developed using the commercial software OPERA/SCALA. The performance of the FEM model in magnetic fields was characterized using parallel fields ranging from 0 to 200 G in the in-line direction, and 0 - 35 G in the perpendicular direction. Results: The FEM model matched the average measured emission current to within 5 % across all three modes of operation. Different high voltage settings are used for the different modes; the 6 X, 10 X, and 15 X modes have an average high voltage setting of 15, 10, and 11 kV. Due to these differences, different operating modes show different sensitivities in magnetic fields. For in line fields, the first current loss occurs at 40, 20, and 30 G for each mode. This is a much greater sensitivity than has previously been observed. For perpendicular fields, first beam loss occurred at 8, 5, and 5 G and total beam loss at 27, 22, and 20 G. Conclusions: A validated FEM model of a clinical <b>triode</b> electron <b>gun</b> has been developed based on accurate geometric and electrical measurements. Three different operating modes were simulated, with a maximum mean error of 5 %. This gun shows greater sensitivity to in-line magnetic fields than previously presented models, and different operating modes show different sensitivity...|$|R
