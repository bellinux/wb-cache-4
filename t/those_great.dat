25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded <b>those</b> <b>great</b> professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

40|$|Frontal EEG {{asymmetry}} {{shifting from}} baseline was examined in adults and infants exposed to lavender and rosemary by reanalyzing previously published data, using techniques {{different from those}} utilized in the original two studies. Results from Study 1 on 39 adults revealed significant EEG shifting in the lavender group, with greater relative left frontal EEG activation (associated with greater approach behavior and less depressed affect). The participants in the two aroma groups were further grouped by <b>those</b> with <b>greater</b> baseline, relative to left frontal EEG activation, versus <b>those</b> with a <b>greater</b> baseline, relative to right frontal activation. Collapsing across aroma groups, <b>those</b> with <b>greater</b> baseline, relative to right frontal activation, shifted left during the aroma. <b>Those</b> with <b>greater</b> baseline relative to left frontal activation did not change. In the rosemary group, <b>those</b> with <b>greater</b> baseline relative to right frontal EEG activation shifted left during the aroma, while <b>those</b> with <b>greater</b> baselines relative to left frontal EEG activation shifted right. In the lavender group, <b>those</b> with <b>greater</b> baselines relative to right frontal baseline EEG activation shifted left, but <b>those</b> with <b>greater</b> baselines relative to left baseline did not shift. Study 2 on 27 full-term newborns revealed no significant shifts in asymmetry in either aroma group. However, when the aroma groups were collapsed, the right frontal EEG group exhibited significant shifting relative to left frontal EEG activation.

500|$|Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian's CEO, {{explained}} why {{they chose to}} use a crowd funding model for Pillars of Eternity instead of the traditional developer and publisher arrangement: [...] "What Kickstarter does is let us make a game that is absolutely reminiscent of <b>those</b> <b>great</b> games, since {{trying to get that}} funded through a traditional publisher would be next to impossible." [...] In an interview, Josh Sawyer said that being free of the limitations of a publisher would enable them to [...] "delve into more mature subject matter slavery, hostile prejudice (racial, cultural, spiritual, sexual), drug use and trade, and so on will all help flesh out the story". Obsidian was said to be inspired by InXile Entertainment's success of using Kickstarter to fund Wasteland 2. Chris Avellone said during the project's announcement that if the campaign were to succeed, Pillars of Eternity would become a franchise. He also ruled out a possible console port of the game, saying, [...] "Those [...] limitations affect RPG mechanics and content more than players may realize (especially for players who've never played a PC RPG and realize what's been lost over the years), and often doesn't add to the RPG experience." [...] Nevertheless, the game was successfully ported to consoles later. Additionally, he has pledged to write a novella set in the game world.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{peaceful}} community of nations had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1795, when Immanuel Kant's [...] outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states. Kant argued {{for the establishment of a}} peaceful world community, not in a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. [...] This period also saw the development of international law, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. As historians William H. Harbaugh and Ronald E. Powaski point out, Theodore Roosevelt was the first American President to call for an international league.
