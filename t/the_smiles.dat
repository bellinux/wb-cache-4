25|$|Tong Chi-On – On is a 30-year-old man who {{strives to}} do his best for the Tong family. He has a helpful {{attitude}} toward {{his friends and family}} and keeps <b>the</b> <b>smiles</b> on everybody’s faces. Although his manner is regarded as loving and caring, he is gullible in his relationships and trusts in people too easily often leading to disastrous results. His greatest desire is to find his real family as he is an adopted son of the Tong family and not of true blood, it turns out he is really Gai's son with a third woman. His love interest is Sheung Joi Sum and although she doesn't love him, he still cares for her. He is a comic character in the beginning but by the end he matures greatly. He stands in the place of Hau after her death and is also straightforward in his acts, rejecting Kam's return to the family (much to the dismay of his father).|$|E

ObjectivesTo assess the relationship between Facial Biotype and <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> aesthetics evaluating <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc and <b>the</b> presence or absence of buccal corridors in subjects with normocclusion. MethodsFrom a sample of 100 subjects with normocclusion, 40 of them were randomly selected, 22 women and 18 men between 18 to 25 years, without temporomandibular joint or periodontal problems and without prior orthodontic treatment. Fontal photographs of social or posed smiles were used to determine <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc (consonant or not consonant) and the presence or absence of buccal corridors. Results 82. 5 % of the subjects showed a brachifacial biotype, with presence of buccal corridors and a consonant smile arc. No statistically significant relation was found between the facial biotype and <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> arc or with the presence or absence of buccal corridors.

500|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{conversation}} between Garcian Smith and Christopher Mills about a new job for the killer7. The assassins battle {{their way to the}} top of a building which has become infested with Heaven Smiles. Harman confronts the source of <b>the</b> <b>Smiles,</b> an angel-like figure, but she is merely Kun Lan's puppet. Harman and Kun Lan discuss the current state of the world before the mission ends. In the subsequent missions, the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons. They kill Andrei Ulmeyda, a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo, when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus. Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn, his former mentor and murderer, when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an organ trafficking business that targets young girls. Their penultimate mission pits them against the [...] "Handsome Men", a group of sentai rangers who assassinate a US politician.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Lukather {{received}} {{an invitation to}} tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton's annual tours each {{be different from the}} last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that [...] "you can hear us having fun on the record—you can hear <b>the</b> <b>smiles</b> on our faces." [...] After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label, also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which {{is said to be a}} mixture of jazz, blues, and fusion music. The resulting album, , won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{completed}} the scenario, Wagner began writing the libretto in 1862, and followed this by composing the overture. The overture was publicly performed in Leipzig on 2 November 1862, {{conducted by the}} composer. Composition of act 1 was begun in spring of 1863 in the Viennese suburb of Penzing, but the opera in its entirety was not finished until October 1867, when Wagner was living at Tribschen near Lucerne. These years were some of Wagner's most difficult: the 1861 Paris production of Tannhäuser was a fiasco, Wagner gave up hope of completing Der Ring des Nibelungen, the 1864 Vienna production of Tristan und Isolde was abandoned after 77 rehearsals, and finally in 1866 Wagner's first wife, Minna died. Cosima Wagner was later to write: [...] "When future generations seek refreshment in this unique work, may they spare a thought for the tears from which <b>the</b> <b>smiles</b> arose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Irwin Ross {{summed up}} the contradictions in Dewey's {{personality}} by noting that [...] "more than most politicians, he displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner. To friends and colleagues he was warm and gracious, considerate of others' views… He could tell a joke and was not dismayed by an off-color story. In public, however, he tended to freeze up, either out of diffidence or too stern {{a sense of the}} dignity of office. <b>The</b> <b>smiles</b> would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward." [...] In a similar vein, a magazine writer in the 1940s described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that [...] "Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be." ...|$|E

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Anatomia artística, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2012 <b>The</b> <b>smile</b> is {{an innate}} and {{universal}} behavior; it {{is defined by}} the elevation of the mouth‟s extremities, a movement produced by the zygomatic major muscle. A smile is an expression of positive emotions, {{but it can also be}} used to hide negative feelings, prevailing here its social nature. A genuine smile is characterized by the joint action of the zygomatic major and orbicularis oculi, which raises the lower eyelid and causes wrinkles on the outer corner of the eye. The universality of <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> admits differences caused by factors such as culture, gender and age, which regulate the frequency and intensity of the smile‟s occurence. In <b>the</b> phylogenetic path, <b>smile</b> evolves from silent bared-teeth. Both play a role of appeasement, emotional bonding and social cohesion. However, human beings have the ability to control and adjust <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> to social situations. <b>The</b> <b>smile</b> is a constant presence on the human being‟s ontogenetic path; initially spontaneous and a reflex, it evolved into a social and instrumental behavior. Laughter, coming from primate‟s play face, is the most intense phase of a muscular process similar to <b>the</b> <b>smile.</b> However, laughter has an extroverted nature which manifests itself through vocalization, and fulfills a social function only. The mouth is the most dynamic element of the face, and the beauty of <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> results from facial harmony and the balance between the teeth and soft tissue. Art expresses a wide range of human emotions. <b>The</b> archaic <b>smile</b> and <b>the</b> <b>smiling</b> face of gothic sculptures consist of an artistic convention. The Baroque presents a wide range of <b>smiles,</b> being probably <b>the</b> most significant art movement regarding the presence of <b>the</b> <b>smile.</b> <b>The</b> ambiguous expression of Mona Lisa reveals the power of <b>the</b> human <b>smile.</b> A closed smile, faded by sfumato, is only perceptible through peripheral visio...|$|R
