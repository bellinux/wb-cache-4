Six months later, he became Academy chief manager, a {{position}} he retained until 2000, when he became manager. Samaras credits his father highly with helping start his football career. His influence meant that Samaras trained every day of his childhood and he also got <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time behind the scenes at OFI. Samaras left for Eredivisie club Heerenveen in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Sir Bobby Robson {{was raised}} {{a few miles}} away from Tow Law, in the village of Langley Park. He had held the title of life {{president}} at the club, and had helped them out when they hit financial difficulties after the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, which devastated the local area. He was known <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time on the club, attending fund raisers and giving talks. On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E

He had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who had an {{interesting}} perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything new about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E

5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks earlier, Irgun {{had learned}} about a Jewish refugee from Vienna named Aaron Weinberg, who had fled to Palestine and {{was working as a}} clerk at a British {{military}} resort camp in north Netanya. This information was already known to the local SHAI (the intelligence arm of the Haganah) commander, Yehoshua Bar-Ziv. Weinberg, who was a SHAI agent, was entrusted by Bar-Ziv with striking up a relationship with two sergeants from the British Army Intelligence Corps, Clifford Martin and Mervyn Paice, who used <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time in the camp.|$|E

He also introduced a large batch of youngsters who were unable to cope with League football. At the end of the 1980–81 season, Blackpool were in the Fourth Division, the League's basement, for the first time. Ball had departed three months earlier, replaced by Allan Brown for his second stint in the Bloomfield Road hotseat. On 21 March 1981, Blackpool played their 3,000th match in the Football League.

50|$|The {{working of}} a book bank {{is similar to a}} library, where books are lent out for a {{specified}} period. However, unlike a library, book banks cater only to students as customers and lend them books for their entire semesters (usually six months). The book banks charge a fee and provide the students with the text books they need for their course. Students benefit by not having <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for their course books.|$|R

25|$|The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{time at the}} surface. So {{much time}} at the surface leads to {{prolonged}} exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure {{to the surface and}} UV rays is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters. While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it seems logical that prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.|$|E
25|$|Jordan was now {{torn between}} his school {{business}} and {{his desire to}} be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money in the next elections {{and to have the}} public support of Turner and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to know anything about it, he had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E

500|$|The writers did {{not want}} <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time {{covering}} Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass {{lying on the ground}} as they follow Jason through his underground tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost [...] $100,000. [...] Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned.|$|E
500|$|Third scale miniatures several {{meters in}} height {{were created to}} give the film the effect of realism, {{rather than relying on}} {{computer}} generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of artificial snow were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: [...] "With computer graphics, you need <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there." [...] A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.|$|E

50|$|Ira Sharkansky {{writes that}} Sternhell fails to {{consider}} the matter of income equality in a comparative perspective.

He also argues that Sternhell's assertion that the Labor Zionist leadership failed {{to address the issue of}} income equality is unfair. Before 1948 the leaders had to rely on voluntary contributions and the Yishuv was poor compared to Western European countries. After 1948 they had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> on the military and there were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of poor immigrants.|$|R

500|$|Feige {{felt that}} the visuals of the film needed [...] "to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip", and said that [...] "You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a {{scientist}} went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not going <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time on that, {{but there will be}} some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E

50|$|The qualities {{designed}} {{into the}} Salmons for {{their role as}} fleet submarines made them well suited for the war they found themselves fighting, but some shortcomings came up that were not apparent prior to the war. It came to be realized that the boats were going <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{more time on the}} surface than what had been previously acknowledged. Thus the large bulk of the conning tower fairwater became a liability. It was too easily spotted by keen-eyed Japanese lookouts using their excellent binoculars. It was found that portions of the fairwater plating could be cut away both fore and aft of the bridge, greatly reducing the silhouette. This also had the desirable effect of creating mounting locations for 20mm Oerlikon autocannons, which were useful against aircraft and small surface targets.|$|R
