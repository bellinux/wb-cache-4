40|$|There is {{a current}} trend for {{manufacturing}} enterprises in {{a supply chain}} of a particular industry to join forces {{in an attempt to}} promote efficiencies and improve competitive position. Such alliances occur in the context of specific legal and business agreements such that each enterprise retains a majority of its business and manufacturing information as private and shares other information with its <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> Shared information may include enterprise demand projections, capacities, finished goods inventories, and aggregate production schedules. Evidence of the trend toward information sharing includes the recent emphases on vendor-managed inventories, quick response, and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), {{organizations}} tend to use service-based applications (SBAs) that are dynamic, distributed, and ubiquitous. In recent years, SBAs have become {{the state of the}} art technologies for building large-scale and cost-effective applications on the web. SBAs that automate end-to-end business processes typically involve well–defined standard composite activities that are hosted at the sites of business partners. These activities encapsulate one to many operations. A business transaction is the successful execution of these operations that must satisfy the <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> <b>agreements</b> which contain the clauses agreed upon by the business partners. In order to ensure the agreement is satisfied during operations, business transactions have to be designed by correlating agreements. Furthermore, business transactions are collaborative, distributed, and long-running and thus they are prone to failure. Therefore, flexibility is a paramount importance for business transactions. A business transaction model should provide design-elements and techniques to design highly flexible business transactions by correlating the <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> <b>agreements.</b> Unfortunately, there is a dearth of a model that enables designing flexible business transactions by correlating the business perspective elements with the functional perspective elements. Existing business transaction models provide a limited number of design–elements and techniques. None of the existing business transaction models are able to provide the necessary and sufficient design-elements and techniques. Accordingly, there is a strong need for a business transaction model which is capable of addressing these shortcomings. This research has developed Solúbtha business transaction model that enables designing business transactions by correlating the business and functional perspective of end-to-end purchase order management processes. Additionally, this thesis has extended the theory of classical atomic behaviour of business transactions to enable designing highly–flexible behaviour of business transactions. The model is built on five properties: fault-tolerance, failure-resiliency, operational autonomy, non-determinism, and extensibility, which are the basic building blocks of flexible behaviour of business transactions. The model is capable of providing recovery operators and other elements that are needed for implementing these properties...|$|R
40|$|The RosettaNet {{standards}} {{have been in}} the limelight for the past few years. The promise of seamless end-to-end integration has proven alluring to the increasingly networked business world. But seamless end-to-end integration requires secure transactions. In this paper, therefore, we examine security and transactions in RosettaNet business processes. Security has been gaining attention with the recent onslaught of virus attacks. In B 2 B integration, security is essential in ensuring trust between <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> We evaluated the RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) against eight security criteria and found that it offers good support for most security aspects. Nevertheless, it also leaves many factors to be specified in process descriptions and <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> <b>agreements,</b> which may result in an insufficient security level. We then compared the relative importance of the eight security aspects at three pulp and paper companies. Support for many aspects of security requires the use of digital certificates, so we next evaluated how certificates are handled in RosettaNet. For the most part, RosettaNet makes dealing with certificates easy, but there are security issues with certificates that have not been resolved...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis examines {{the implementation of}} electronic data interchange (EDI) with small business suppliers in the pre-award acquisition process. The general history and concept of EDI is discussed along with the pre- award acquisition process. The results of a small business survey are analyzed to provide insight on the barriers and impediments to implementing EDI with small business concerns. Additionally, interviews and discussions with major corporations were conducted to identify common lessons learned by these corporations {{in their efforts to}} implement EDI with their small business supplier base. The major conclusion drawn is that DoD can successfully implement EDI with its small business supplier base in the preaward acquisition process. It was determined that the following key factors are crucial to successful implementation of EDI with small business: (1) provide effective training; (2) specifically direct grant funding to the Procurement Technical Assistance Centers; (3) require the Small Business Administration to aggressively sponsor and implement EDI training; (4) draft legislation to modify or eliminate restrictive laws and regulations; and (5) foster the use of Value-Added Networks, <b>Trading</b> <b>Partner</b> <b>Agreements,</b> and EDI Service Bureaus. These efforts would provide the basic infrastructure to enable DoD to train, nurture, and help problem solve with small businesses once DoD becomes totally reliant upon EDI.

40|$|Abstract: Using a {{multi-sector}} multi-country {{computable general equilibrium}} model, {{we examine}} Chile’s “additive regionalism ” strategy of negotiating bilateral free trade agreements {{with all of its}} significant <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> Chile’s <b>agreements</b> with “Northern ” partners provide sufficient market access to overcome trade diversion costs for Chile. By lowering its tariff from eleven to six percent, Chile is able to reduce trade diversion from all its regional agreements. This converts MERCOSUR from a negative to a positive agreement. Due to preferential market access, additive regionalism is likely to provide Chile with gains that are many multiples of the static welfare gains from unilateral free trade. We find that at least one partner country loses from each of the regional agreements we consider, and excluded countries as a group always lose. Gains to the world from global free trade are estimated to be vastly larger than any of the regional arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Most {{previous}} {{research in the}} Information Systems discipline focused on information systems and technology, e-commerce applications such as Inter-Organizational Systems (IOSs), competitive advantages, and security issues. The emphasis on IOSs' gave rise to concerns about Inter-Organizational Relationships (IORs), as <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> {{became aware of the}} social-political factors that affected their relationships. IOSs involve the sharing of e-commerce applications in different locations. When this study was initiated in 1997, universal standards were not fully developed. This posed a security concern for Small-Medium-Enterprises, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. This study examines the importance of inter-organizational trust (<b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> trust) in ecommerce participation. The objective {{of this study is to}} empirically examine the importance of interorganizational- trust in e-commerce participation. Despite the acknowledged importance of trust, only limited research has examined the role of trust among <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> in business-to-business e-commerce, when this study was initiated in 1997. As the participation in e-commerce increased, the need for trust among <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> became more pertinent in business-to-business e-commerce. Exploratory research was carried out via three case studies in the automotive industry. The automotive industry was selected as a critical and typical case for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) via Value-Added-Networks, and the findings emphasized on the importance of interorganizational trust in e-commerce participation. The exploratory study, together with a literature review, provided the theoretical foundations for the development of the conceptual model. Theories from multiple disciplines including the marketing, management, sociology, information systems and e-commerce were applied in the conceptual model. The research question developed for this study is: How does inter-organizational trust (<b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> trust) influence the perception of ecommerce benefits and risks of e-commerce, thus influencing the extent of participation in ecommerce? The conceptual model was then tested using a multiple-case-study research strategy that aimed to solicit qualitative and in-depth understanding of inter-organizational trust in the context of business-tobusiness e-commerce. Ten organizations from a cross-industry selection that formed four bi-directional dyads and two uni-directional dyads participated in the study. They included a public sector organization involved in customs clearance; their Internet service provider; a customs agent (broker); an importer; two organizations in the computer and data communications industry; two organizations in the telecommunications industry; and two organizations in the automotive industry. The primary unit of analysis in this study is the uni-directional dyad. The case study participants included e-commerce coordinators, IT managers, and senior executives involved in e-commerce. In addition, e-commerce applications, existing documents, and standards contributed to secondary data sources. For example, <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> <b>agreements,</b> organizational charts, web sites, and internal security policies gave evidence of the organizations' best business practices and background information on the organization and their products. The findings of the four bi-directional dyads (eight organizations) and the two uni-directional dyads indicated that trust was important for participation in e-commerce. The findings differed by the type of e-commerce application used and the industry. For example, organizations that developed extranet applications had only one trading party (the supplier) undertaking the implementation process. Suppliers were involved in the installation of their websites that provided product information. In addition, suppliers had to train their buyers to use extranet applications. The products consisted of many different parts, (such as data communications, computers and telecommunications) which made the task of placing an order complex. These inter-organizational dyads (Cisco-Compaq NZ, and Siemens-Telecom NZ) experienced relational risks arising from the need to establish trust among their <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> On the other hand, Avery Ford NZ and Toyota NZ applied intranet applications and Internet-based EDI for routine orders between the manufacturers and suppliers. Smaller organizations such as the customs broker and the importer experienced a smooth e-commerce adoption due to their application "Trade Manager" which was not connected to the Internet. The study contributes to theory, practice and research in the following ways: First, rather than inferring characteristics of e-commerce adoption from a technical and economic background, this study examined behavioral characteristics of <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> in business-to-business ecommerce from theories in multi-disciplines. The primary emphasis of prior research was on transaction economics, its competitive advantages and/or external pressure (socio-political). This study focused on the importance of inter-organizational trust in e-commerce participation. The findings of the study led to the development of a model of inter-organizational trust within bi-directional dyads in e-commerce participation. Second, the study contributed to practice as it increased the awareness of e-commerce practitioners, who will check the trust behaviors of themselves and that of their <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>partners</b> will be better able to select and evaluate trust and security-based mechanisms in e-commerce, thus protecting themselves against opportunistic behaviors of their <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> Third, the study contributed to research as it paved the way for longitudinal studies. This study only took a micro-perspective of inter-organizational trust within dyadic relationships as it was intended to be an exploratory study. Further research should extensively test the model using a field survey with business-to-business e-commerce organizations. This thesis aims to empirically examine the role of inter-organizational trust (<b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> trust) in e-commerce participation. By doing so, trust behaviors in business relationships were identified. The findings from ten organizations that formed four bi-directional dyads and two uni-directional dyads contributed to a model of inter-organizational trust within bi-directional dyads. The model identified the development of inter-organizational trust in three stages and identified trust behaviors and characteristics involved in the gradual development of trust from one stage to the next stage, thus providing an awareness of trust behaviors that <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> need to develop. For example competence trust emphasized on an individual or team's ability and skills to operate e-commerce system and applications (i. e. is at a technical level). Predictability trust examined the reflections and interpersonal experiences of the <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> based on past experiences, and a consistency of <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> behaviors. Goodwill trust examined the institutional (i. e. the organization's image, reputation that determines the strategic benefits). Overall, the findings indicated that trust in inter-organizational relationships clearly matter...|$|R

Second, the EU being a large <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> in such <b>agreements,</b> does reciprocity matter for giving meaningful preferential access? For a given MFN tariff, we model the preferential tariff with a simple linear functional form. We draw three important conclusions.

Our findings-based on an extended database for de jure and de facto exchange rate classifications-show that while fixed exchange rate regimes increase trade, there is no systematic difference in the effects of policy announcements versus actions to maintain exchange rate stability. The trade generating effect of more stable exchange rate regimes is however more pronounced when words and actions are aligned, both in the short and long-run. Policy credibility therefore {{plays an important role}} in determining the effects of de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements such that deviations between the two could be costly. In addition, we find evidence that (i) the impact of hard pegs such as currency unions is broadly similar to that of conventional pegs; (ii) the currency union and direct peg effects evolve over time; and (iii) the effects of more stable regimes are heterogeneous across country groups.

40|$|A central {{statement}} {{of the theory of}} natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is that preferential trading with regional <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is less likely to be trade diverting and therefore geographically proximate partners are to be considered "natural" partners for preferential arrangements.

Since the argument for "natural" <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is based on the greater likelihood of geographically proximate countries to be more significant <b>trading</b> <b>partners,</b> correlations between the welfare change estimates and bilateral trade volume are examined as well.
