5|$|With a good {{level of}} {{socialisation}} {{at an early}} age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed {{seems to have a}} perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E
5|$|Max {{leaves the}} house when Ray reappears and Tim accuses Ray of ruining his night. Lee and Ben {{make their way to}} the beach and share a kiss. Tim returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> and uncovers a ring and what appears to be a human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws {{everything}} he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E
5|$|Costa, Thomas, and J.B. go to buy {{marijuana}} from drug-dealer T-Rick. While T-Rick {{gets the}} marijuana, Costa steals his lawn gnome {{to use as}} a party mascot. As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} {{residential}} development on its western slope and continuing deforestation due to condominium construction around SFU, the mountain {{still has some}} wildlife remaining such as deer, raccoons, coyotes customarily roaming local streets, {{and even a few}} black bears, sometimes mothers with cubs, who pay occasional visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> of Westridge residents. Common wild birds include several types of woodpeckers, northern flickers, Steller's jays, and great blue herons.|$|R
2500|$|Mozarthaus: birthplace {{and house}} of the famous Austrian {{composer}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which was constructed {{at the end of}} the 16th century. During 3 days in November of 1783, being a resident of the house, he composed the “Linzer Sinfonie” and “Linzer Sonate”. Today, it is allowed <b>to</b> visit <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> of <b>the</b> house but prohibited <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> house itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{abandoned}} {{station is}} surrounded {{on one side}} by a row of backyard fences. While {{this is a common}} sight in Sydney's working class inner-west and inner-south, it is interesting <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> of multimillion-dollar properties backing onto a heavy rail line just metres away. On the other side, the station is bordered by a large empty park-like area.|$|R
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard.</b> The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled {{the bottom of a}} public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{experience}} of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.|$|E
500|$|The {{time machine}} gets {{destroyed}} {{so the two}} Candaces go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future(wearing a white lab coat {{as seen in the}} picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks an idea and travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop). In [...] "Summer Belongs To You", Phineas mentions time traveling twice and Isabella comments that Phineas has traveled through time [...] "twice", but because of the events in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, no-one - including Isabella [...] should actually know about the time-traveling.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, in Los Angeles, inner-city residents, who {{are much}} more likely to be poor minorities, have {{significantly}} fewer parks than suburban residents. Furthermore, there is less likely to be proper maintenance at inner-city parks. Parks may play different roles in the lives of inner-city youth than they do for suburban, wealthy youth, who are more likely <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> and private play areas that inner-city youth lack.|$|R
50|$|In August 2005, the {{community}} hosted mass demonstrations in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Israeli disengagement from Gaza, {{which included the}} forced evacuation of four settlements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Shavei Shomron, and brought a potential frontier <b>to</b> <b>the</b> settlement's <b>backyard.</b> Following their evacuation and demolition, {{the community}} hosted some of the former residents of Homesh and Sa-Nur.|$|R

After trying some rides, Bart gets himself into trouble by crashing {{a display of}} Hitler's limousine into a tree. <b>To</b> repay <b>the</b> loss, Bart and Homer become carnies.|$|R
2500|$|Sliding {{glass doors}} {{are common in}} many houses, {{particularly}} as an entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard.</b> Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the [...] "active leaf", while the door that remains fixed is called the [...] "inactive leaf".|$|E
50|$|Roonstraße 5 was {{property}} of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge in Bydgoszcz until World War I. The lodge itself was located at Roonstraße 6, via a small pathway leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> (now the path leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> of N°4). The Odd Fellows lodge in Bydgoszcz has been disbanded in 1938, together with other obediences housed in the same edifice. The villa is now at Libelta street N°8.|$|E

50|$|After Zeze’s {{father got}} fired, {{the whole family}} moves and the new house has a few trees that each {{siblings}} claim. After having all the trees being taken, Zeze gets upset, {{but one of his}} older sister, Gloria, suggest him <b>to</b> check <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> and soon Zeze discovers a small orange tree. At first sight, Zeze doesn’t like his tree, but he finds out that amazingly, he can communicate with it. He gives the tree a name, Minguinho and the two become best friends.|$|R
50|$|A child {{learns to}} open a door and walks outside. He finds some ants behind a {{shrubbery}} and watches the ants. His parents are looking for him, they get worried and are calling him. The child is unusually mesmerized by columns of ants {{on the ground and}} does not hear the calls. His parents find him shortly after, but they are frantic from their 5-minute search and accidentally scare him from going outside. In this non-example, learning to open doors that lead outside resulted in consequences that did not directly benefit the child and maybe decrease important skills related to exploration and search. In this case, no new reinforcers were contacted and learning <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> door (that has a special latch) was effectively a waste of time because the child's parents don't usually approve being alone in <b>the</b> <b>backyard.</b>|$|R

50|$|Directed by Kevin Leonard {{and shot}} on {{location}} in Riverside, CA. The video features the band raiding a house where four bikini clad girls are sunbathing in the back yard. While they proceed <b>to</b> perform in <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> <b>the</b> video is intercut with humorous short skits involving the girls and the individual band members. The video was featured on MTV2's Headbangers Ball and grabbed more than 100,000 downloads from Century Media Records' website. It was both loved and hated by moving outside the typical metal video box.|$|R
50|$|The Championship {{match was}} 6-wicket Oxford style, {{modified}} <b>to</b> squeeze into <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> pitch of host Colin and Katherine Olson’s West Kelowna home. Nickel jumped {{out to an}} early lead, but was surpassed midway through the course by Wile. The close quarters and out-of-bounds hazards kept players modest, and no lead seemed insurmountable. Though the competitors had an “Anybody-But-Brian” mentality going into the match, Martin was trailing behind when the unexpected occurred.|$|R

Deducing that the Klopeks must have entered Walter's house in order <b>to</b> retrieve <b>the</b> toupee, Ray and the others are convinced the Klopeks have murdered Walter, and <b>the</b> trio agree <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> Klopeks' <b>backyard</b> <b>the</b> next day, knowing the Klopeks would be gone for the day.|$|R

50|$|The Istanbul Residency Program was {{launched}} in 2003. It was supported by numerous national and regional funding bodies. From 2004 the residency program attempted to focus more specifically on inviting artists from the geographies surrounding Turkey {{with the support of}} the Open Society and the American Center Foundation. From 2006 <b>to</b> 2010 <b>The</b> <b>Backyard</b> Residency program, a project launched under the SEE Mobility Project (Artists' Residences in South East Europe), supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers invited four artists from the countries of South East Europe. In 2009 and 2010 the program Accented Residencies supported by the British Council http://www.britishcouncil.org/turkey-arts-creative-collaboration-accented-residency-programme.htm provided residency opportunities again from this geography. The institution also helped a number of artists from Turkey to spend time on residency programs in other countries around the world from 2006 until 2010. The residency program at Platform was terminated at the end of 2010.|$|R

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secondary <b>backyard</b> was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask <b>to</b> inspect <b>the</b> back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered <b>the</b> front door <b>to</b> talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted <b>to</b> leave. While <b>the</b> family kept <b>to</b> themselves, <b>the</b> girls were sometimes seen playing in <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|R
