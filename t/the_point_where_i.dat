40|$|Recently, P. J. Cameron {{studied a}} class of block designs which generalises the classes of t-designs, α-resolved 2 -designs, {{orthogonal}} arrays, and other classes of combinatorial designs. In fact, Cameron’s generalisation of t-designs (when there are no repeated blocks) is a special case of the “poset t-designs ” in product association schemes studied ten years earlier by W. J. Martin, who further studied the special case of “mixed block designs”. In this paper, we study Cameron’s generalisation of t-designs from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of classical t-design theory, in particular investigating the parameters of these generalised t-designs. We show that the t-design constants λi (the number of blocks containing an i-subset of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>i</b> ≤ t) and λ j i (the number of blocks containing an i-subset I of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> and disjoint from a j-subset J of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> ∩ J = ∅ and i + j ≤ t) have very natural counterparts for generalised t-designs. Our main result places strong restrictions on the block structure of Cameron’s t-(v, k, λ) designs, an important subclass of generalised t-designs. We also generalise N. S. Mendelsohn’s concept of “intersection numbers of order r ” for t-designs, and show that analogous equations to those of Mendelsohn hold for generalised t-designs.

40|$|Recently, P. J. Cameron {{introduced}} {{a new class of}} block designs which generalises the class of t-designs, and also includes orthogonal arrays, resolved 2 -designs, and other classes of combinatorial designs. The main idea is that <b>the</b> set of <b>points</b> of <b>the</b> design is structured by an ordered partition of that set, and the blocks of the design and t-subsets of the point-set also have structure with respect to this pointset partition. There is now the prospect that techniques, theorems and bounds for one class of combinatorial designs may be generalised to many classes of designs at once, via these generalised t-designs. In this paper, we investigate the parameters of generalised t-designs, providing some strong necessary conditions for the existence of certain types of such designs. We show that the t-design constants λi (the number of blocks containing an i-subset of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>i</b> ≤ t) and λ j i (the number of blocks containing an i-subset I of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> and disjoint from a j-subset J of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> ∩ J = ∅ and i + j ≤ t) have natural counterparts for generalised t-designs.
