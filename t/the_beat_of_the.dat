5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button in time with <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|The Karashishi is {{most notably}} found in Japan at the {{entrance}} of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward-off bad spirits or welcome good spirits. The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum of a young boy. Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{whirring}} {{sound of}} 'urumi' providing the melody and <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thappu providing the rhythm, accompany the dance sequence {{in this kind}} of temple art form. This is performed especially in Amman temples during the month of Adi. Nowadays, this art form is found only in selected villages in a few districts.|$|E

25|$|Pair sticks, {{sometimes}} called clapsticks or bilma, establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies. The {{rhythm of the}} didgeridoo and <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clapsticks are precise, and these patterns have been handed down for many generations. In the Wangga genre, the song-man starts with vocals and then introduces blima {{to the accompaniment of}} didgeridoo.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{of music in}} the Royal Marines is inextricably linked with the evolution of British military bands. Lively airs and <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum enabled columns of marching men to keep a regular step. The drum was the normal method of giving signals on the battlefield or in camp. As long ago as the days of Drake and Hawkins the drummer's rhythm would advertise the changing watches or beat the men to quarters.|$|E
25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|E

25|$|After {{singing the}} opening kriti, usually, the {{performer}} sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The performer must improvise {{a string of}} swaras in any octave {{according to the rules}} of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses or lapses in <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.|$|E
25|$|In {{many forms}} of music, the bass drum is used to mark or keep time. The bass drum makes a low, boom sound when the mallet hits the drumhead. In marches {{it is used to}} project tempo (marching bands {{historically}} march to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bass). A basic beat for rock and roll has the bass drum played on the first and third beats of a bars of common time, with the snare drum on the second and fourth beats, called back beats. In jazz, the bass drum can vary from almost entirely being a timekeeping medium to being a melodic voice in conjunction with the other parts of the set.|$|E
25|$|The next step, wrote Kahn, was {{to impart}} unity and {{cohesion}} {{by means of}} a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strophe. As Kahn noted, this was shocking because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the metronome-like symmetry and introduced liberty, flexibility and elasticity. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' would undermine the French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} {{the members of}} Sakanaction in traditional Japanese clothing and gaudy make-up, {{at the foot of}} Mount Fuji alongside two traditional Japanese dancers. The video is composed of several scenes where the camera's distance grows closer to the performers, showing scenes sequentially closer in time to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song. While some of these takes were shot in daylight, others were taken in darkness, while the band or Yamaguchi were lit by colored lights. In {{the latter part of the}} video, it is revealed that the view of the band is from the perspective of a high school girl (played by actress and model Yui Miura), who wears binoculars to view the band. The camera then focuses on the girl using the same technique that the band was shot in. The girl finds Yamaguchi performing the song directly in front of her, and finally decides to run away.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter and premiered on October 23, 2006. The video includes the prelude to the song ("Let Me Talk to You"), which includes the song's producer, Timbaland and features T.I. The video incorporates a black-and-white background and dancing, choreographed as the steps are in sync with <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song.|$|E
500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] is {{featured}} in the 2002 British comedy-drama film About a Boy.

500|$|The song is a rap {{performed}} by the character Bart Simpson about his trouble-making antics. Groening has described it as [...] "the tragic story of Bart Simpson, a bad youth gone worse." [...] The Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart on the show, provided the character's voice in [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] as well. The characters Homer Simpson and Maggie Simpson are also featured, with Homer ranting at Bart, and Maggie sucking on her pacifier to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall) {{appeared}} {{at the top of}} Big Ben and reprised Caliban's [...] "Be not afeard" [...] speech from The Tempest, first read by Kenneth Branagh in the opening ceremony. More paper-covered motor vehicles entered. After Churchill finished his speech, people dressed in newspaper print began to fill the arena, ranging from office workers to school children. <b>The</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music got faster and noisier, symbolising the London rush hour. [...] As the noise reached a crescendo, Churchill cried out for all to stop, bringing this section to an end.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "One" [...] {{was shot in}} Tokyo. The video opens with Suzuki singing while surrounded by several white lights.
