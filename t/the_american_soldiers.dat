5|$|After {{crossing}} the Rio Grande and arriving at Ojo de Agua at approximately 1am, the Mexican raiders attacked the village's garrison. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{who had been}} sleeping in a wooden building stubbornly resisted. The Americans were heavily outgunned, though, as the Signal Corps personnel were armed only with pistols. In the fighting Sergeant Schaeffer was killed, {{and as a result}} command devolved to Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith who by that time had also been wounded three times. In addition to attacking the garrison, the raiders robbed the post office and attacked the home of the Dillard family, setting their house on fire and stealing their livestock.|$|E
5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the raid}} one {{civilian}} and three American soldiers had been killed and eight wounded including the Ojo de Agua post's commanding officer, Sergeant Schaffer, who was included among the former. The Seditionistas also took several casualties, with five men dead and at least nine others wounded, of whom two later died. A Japanese man was found among the dead, as were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen as evidence that the Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> were commended for their bravery during the raid, and Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the engagement.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, {{transports}} with artillery, siege tools, {{and some}} French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk, {{the northern end}} of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown. The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right. Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point. That day, Washington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be bombarded into submission. The Americans and the French spent the night of the 28th sleeping out in the open, while work parties built bridges over the marsh. Some of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> hunted down wild hogs to eat.|$|E
5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{announced}} {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a visit to his home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|General Hay {{initially}} portrayed Ong Thanh as an American {{victory and}} cited 101 enemy {{dead in the}} battle. However, American veterans who survived the ordeals of the battle were adamant they were ambushed and defeated by the Viet Cong's 271st Regiment. The estimate of 101 enemy dead officially provided by the U.S. military was likely much inflated to emphasize {{the scale of the}} 'American victory'. For retired U.S. Army Brigadier General James E. Shelton, who was then a major and served as an Operations Officer with the 2nd Battalion, the lack of reliable intelligence and overconfidence on the part of Allen as the battalion commander, were some of the factors that led to the disastrous outcome in the Ong Thanh battle. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> under Allen's command lacked fighting experience, whereas the Viet Cong soldiers of the 9th Division were tough and experienced light infantry. The Viet Cong 271st Regiment, after their victory at Ong Thanh, withdrew back towards their base area near the Cambodian border.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> disembarked, a {{group of}} Spanish and Puerto Rican units began moving from Ponce to Aibonito, marching through the Carretera Central (Central Road).

A total of 248 infantry men and 42 members of the cavalry formed the battalions under the command of Lt. Col. Rafael Martínez Illescas, the same commander {{who was in charge of}} the Ponce garrison. Traveling by foot, the journey would last two days. The group decided to spend one night in the resort of the town of Coamo known as the Baños de Coamo before continuing their march in the morning. Martínez Illescas immediately ordered the construction of several trenches; while building these, the soldiers were ambushed by an anti-Spanish guerilla force, led by Pedro María Descartes, who managed to kill a member of the Civil Guard.|$|E
