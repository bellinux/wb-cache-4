The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate and compare the patterns of MT in patients from Vietnam, Ethiopia and Sweden. Methods: Cross-sectional samples were obtained from treatment-naïve patients living with HIV- 1 and healthy controls from Vietnam (n= 83; n= 46), Ethiopia (n= 9492; n= 50) and Sweden (n= 51; n= 19). Longitudinal samples were obtained from a subset of the Vietnamese (n= 24) in whom antiretroviral therapy (ART) and <b>tuberculostatics</b> were given. Plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS), sCD 14 and anti-flagellin IgG were determined by the endpoint chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: All three biomarkers were significantly increased in patients living with HIV- 1 from all countries as compared to controls. No differences were found between males and females. Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients had significantly higher levels of anti-flagellin IgG and LPS, as compared to Swedes. ART reduced these levels for the Vietnamese. Vietnamese patients given <b>tuberculostatics</b> at initiation of ART had significantly lower levels of anti-flagellin IgG and higher sCD 14. The biomarkers were lower in Vietnamese who did not develop opportunistic infection. Conclusions: Higher MT is common in patients living with HIV compared to healthy individuals, and in patients from LMICs compared to patients from a high-income country.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is {{a common}} concern. However, data on DILI {{epidemiology}} in inpatients are sparse. METHODS: To investigate the incidence of DILI, we screened all patients in the pharmacoepidemiological inpatient database according to the CIOMS (Council for International Organisation of Medical Science) criteria, which consist of the evaluation of some clinical chemistry laboratory liver parameters (CIOMS laboratory criteria) and the exclusion of any disease-related causes for the liver injury. Thus, only cases with probable or certain causality according to the World Health Organization criteria were included. RESULTS: Among a total of 6383 patients, liver parameters were determined in 4610, and 489 among them fulfilled the CIOMS laboratory criteria. However, 401 patients had to be excluded because of disease-related liver injury and, thus, the study cohort consisted of 4209 patients at risk for DILI. Among a total of 88 DILI cases, 31 had no documented normal baseline liver parameters and, thus, represented prevalent cases. The remaining 57 represented incident DILI cases. Thus, the incidence of DILI was 1. 4 % (95 % CI 1. 0, 1. 7). The drug classes most frequently causing DILI were heparins, antibacterials, <b>tuberculostatics</b> and antineoplastic agents. Among those, antineoplastic agents and <b>tuberculostatics</b> showed the highest incidence. Liver injury was not mentioned among the diagnoses or in the physician's discharge letter in about 52 - 68 % of all cases. CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 in 100 patients develops DILI during hospitalisation in a department of medicine. Incidences of DILI were highest for antineoplastic agents and <b>tuberculostatics.</b> DILI is frequently missed and, therefore, DILI detection by diagnoses will result in misleadingly low incidence rates...|$|R
40|$|Background. Standard antituberculosis {{treatment}} and {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} are frequently associated with hepatotoxicity leading to drugs discontinuation. Objective. This study aimed {{to assess the}} signs of hepatotoxicity in albino rats in case of simultaneous usage of <b>tuberculostatics</b> (TBS) and antiretroviral agents (ART). Methods. Healthy rats were divided in 4 groups: 1 st control group; 2 nd group was given <b>tuberculostatics</b> (isoniazid – 50 mg/kg, rifampicin – 50 mg/kg and pyrazinamide – 1500 mg/kg); 3 rd group was given ART (efavirenz – 150 mg/kg and stavudine – 5 mg/kg); 4 th group was given TBS and ART. The animals were sacrificed painlessly on the 29 th day; blood and liver samples were obtained. The main biochemical and histopathological indices were determined. Conclusions. Comparing with control group, repeated usage of TBS caused the prominent liver injury with cytolysis and cholestasis signs, decreasing of CYP 3 A and CYP 2 E 1 isozymes activity and dysfunction of protein synthesis by the liver. ART (efavirenz and stavudine) caused the elevation of transaminases activity with the increase of serum bilirubin level at the background of increase in cytochrome 450 isoforms 3 A and 2 E 1 activities and total serum protein. The antiretroviral agents in case of simultaneous administration with the antituberculosis drugs diminished the hepatotoxic effects of first-line drugs for tuberculosis treatment which was confirmed by the study of liver histopathology. Such results of our experimental study give encouragement for further detailed clinical research of drug-drug interaction of both pharmacological groups due to the rising cases of HIV-associated tuberculosis in the whole world.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{characterization}} of polymeric micelle-forming <b>tuberculostatic</b> prodrugs and the antimycobacterial activity of these prodrugs. Method: By the condensation of hydroxymethylpyrazinamide, isoniazid and rifampin with free carboxyl groups on the copolymer poly(ethyleneglycol) -poly(aspartic acid), micelle-forming carrier-drug conjugates were obtained. These micelles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, to measure the micelle diameter; by acid-base titration, to determine the percentage of carboxylic groups occupied by the tuberculostatic; by Sudan III solubility tests, to estimate the critical micelle concentration (CMC); and visual control and spectrophotometric measurement, to determine the stability of micelles. These micelles were tested in vitro against several Mycobacterium strains. Results: As expected, the size and distribution of the micelle-forming <b>tuberculostatic</b> prodrugs found to be small (78. 2 nm, 84. 2 nm and 98. 9 nm) while {{the level of the}} drug conjugated was high (65. 02 - 85. 7 %).

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} in vitro transdermal diffusion of a small peptide namely arginine vasopressin (AVP) with the aid of the novel PheroidTM drug delivery system. Generally, peptides seem unfit for transdermal permeation, but it was thought prudent to explore the suitability of this lipid-based system after success was achieved with entrapment of <b>tuberculostatics,</b> bacteria and viruses. Bestatin (a selective aminopeptidase inhibitor) was employed to circumvent any skin-related degradation of the active. Therefore, the effect of bestatin on the preservation of AVP during diffusion was investigated. Vertical Franz cell diffusion studies were conducted with female abdominal skin, with AVP at a concentration of 150 pglml in the donor phase and Hepes buffer as the receptor phase over a twelve-hour period. To prove entrapment of AVP within the lipid structures of the PheroidsTM, fluorescentlylabelled samples were monitored by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which revealed definite entrapment. In vitro permeation profiles for AVP exhibited a biphasic character, with the majority of permeation occurring during the first two hours. The PheroidTM delivery system proved to be advantageous when applied as delivery medium. The inclusion of bestatin has an enhancing effect on permeation probably due to its protection of AVP.

40|$|By {{incorporating}} a known <b>tuberculostatic</b> agent {{on one end}} of a surface-active molecule, an increased in vitro effect on the tubercle bacillus has been obtained. This activity is presumably due to the concentration of the drug molecules at or beneath the mycobacterial cell boundary. Whether the surface-active drug actually penetrates the lipid, or lipoprotein complex that is so characteristic of the mycobacteria is only problematic. According to comparable purely physical-chemical experiments, such a penetration is quite likely. Increase in <b>tuberculostatic</b> effect of over 1000 -fold has been attained by rendering surface-active the drugs included in this study. The quantitative evaluation of this increase in activity has been obtained by measuring drug action both when its surface-active properties are functional, and when these properties have been selectively abolished by a specific surface-active antagonist. It is believed that the molecular orientation of a surface-active drug about a bacterial cell accounts for one component of its antibacterial action. Certain previously described surface-active antituberculous drugs and antibiotics have been examined in light of this interpretation. It may be anticipated that the more potent <b>tuberculostatic</b> drugs such as streptomycin could be made more effective by incorporating the molecule into a surface-active compound, according to the principles herein described...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Despite modern imaging methods, tuberculous abscess in the {{subdural}} {{space of}} the spine can lead to misdiagnosis and to neurogical complications development, even more up to paraplegia. We presented an extremely rare case of subdural tuberculous abscess of the lumbar (L) spine and paraparesis in imunocompetent a 49 -year-old patient. Case report. A patient with chronic L syndrome {{and a history of}} intervertebral (IV) disc L 3 and L 5 operations got severe back pain late in July 2007. At the same time the patient had a purulent collection in the left knee, and was treated with high doses of corticosteroids and antibiotics. Then, the patient got a high fever, the amplification of pain in the L spine and the development of paraparesis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm/ 1 h, Creactive protein 106. 0 mg/L, white blood cell (WBC) 38. 4 x 09 /L with a left turn. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was registered expansive formation in the spinal canal, from the level of the IV disc L 2 to the mid-L 4 vertebral body. This finding is a “spoke” in favor of the extrusion and sequestration of IV disc L 3 with the cranial and caudal migration. The patient underwent an emergency neurosurgical operation. The diagnosis of subdural staphylococcal abscess of L spine was made. According to the antibiogram antibiotic therapy was applied but without effect on the course of the disease. Control MRI of the L spine showed spondylodiscitis L 3 /L 4, abscess collection in the spinal canal and paravertebral muscle abscess.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of the transdermal delivery of isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) by means of the novel PheroidTM technology system. 'The application of the latter is being investigated in combination with various actives such as peptides (insulin, human growth hormone), anti-malarial drugs (chloroquine), anti-fungals (ketoconazole), local anaesthetics (lidocaine, prilocaine) as well as <b>tuberculostatics</b> (ethambutol, pyrazinamide etc.) via different administration routes at the North- West University. PheroidTM, a stable skin-friendly carrier, comprises of a submicron (200 nm - 2 m) emulsion type formulation for which previous studies have confirmed the ability to penetrate keratinised tissue, skin, intestinal linings, the vascular system, fungi, bacteria and even parasites. Studies involving an oral PheroidTM formulation containing the current approved regime of four anti-tuberculosis drugs showed improved efficacy results whilst an in vitro analysis of bacterial growth indicated a reduction in drug resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains. Therefore we thought it prudent to ascertain whether or not the PheroidTM system would be able to improve the transdermal delivery of a combination of INH and RMP as a possible treatment against cutaneous tuberculosis (tuberculosis involving the skin). The latter refers to pathological lesions of the skin caused by any one of the following: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis or the bacilli Calmette- Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Demonstration of M. tuberculosis within the infected tissues by traditional acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining, culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirms the diagnosis. CTB lesions are associated with various degrees of {{one or more of the}} following ulceration, plaque formation, hyperkeratosis or the presence of necrotic matter. Seeing as C-TB is mostly associated with systemic involvement, current treatment comprises of the standard three/four drug regimens used for pulmonary 'TB in general. Cases of CTB usually show improvement within 1 month of therapy with anti-TB drugs, but complete resolution is only attained after 4 - 6 months. 'The major drawback to current therapy is that patients not only remain a source of infection (viable organisms can still be demonstrated in the lesions), but they also suffer from constant embarrassment due to the disfiguring nature of CTB until these lesions have healed completely. No evidence of an already existing topical formulation of this kind could be found. Therefore in vitro permeation studies were conducted using vertical Franz diffusion cells and female abdominal skin as permeation membrane over a period of 12 hours. Concentrations of 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml for isoniazid(INH) and rifampicin (RMP) respectively, were applied to the donor phase suspended in either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or entrapped in PheroidTM. Permeation studies were conducted at pH 5. 5. In vitro penetration of INH and RMP were assayed directly by HPLC. Particle size distribution for rifampicin and entrapment of actives within the PheroidTM carrier system was determined by polarized light and laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) respectively and revealed definite entrapment. Permeation profiles obtained for INH in PheroidTM indicated a biphasic character, whilst that obtained for RMP in PheroidTM showed a triphasic character. The PheroidTM delivery system proved more efficacious for delivery of both anti-tubercular drugs and resulted in greater percentage yield as well as flux values than that for a PBS solution. Furthermore, the PheroidTM formulation was able to deliver, the entrapped INH and RMP in concentrations sufficient to exceed their respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Master...|$|R

40|$|The <b>tuberculostatic</b> {{activity}} of 2 -butoxy 5 -aminopyridine in vitro was de-scribed {{in a previous}} report (1). It was shown that this compound was capable of inhibiting the growth of virulent and avirulent tubercie bacilli in high dilution and that its bacteriostatic properties were specific {{for members of the}} genus Mycobacterium. The acute toxicity of this substance (LD 50) for mice approximated 0. 4 gram/ kgm. (2). This rather high degree of toxicity interfered greatly with the applica-tion of this compound to studies on its effect in experimental tuberculosis in vivo. Nevertheless, by careful control of dosage it was shown that this pyridine deriva-tive favorably influenced the course of tuberculosis in the guinea pig (2). Because of its interesting properties it was decided to undertake a program of synthesis of various types of derivatives of 2 -butoxy 5 -aminopyridine with the object of preparing a compound with <b>tuberculostatic</b> properties but of lower toxicity for the animal host. The chemical work involving the synthesis of several hundred derivatives was carried out under the direction of one of u...|$|E
