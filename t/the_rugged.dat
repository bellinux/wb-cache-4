5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|Craters of the Moon is {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 {{cuts through the}} northwestern part of the {{monument}} and provides access to it. However, <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.|$|E
50|$|Windy Falls {{is one of}} <b>the</b> most <b>rugged</b> waterfalls in one of <b>the</b> most <b>rugged</b> {{areas of}} <b>the</b> Southeastern United States. Located on the Wild and Scenic Horsepasture River in North Carolina's Jocassee Gorges, Windy has {{attained}} a Cult reputation with Waterfallers wanting to hike to its elusive portions. The main drop of the waterfall is approximately 75 feet in height, and Bear Rock Falls immediately above Windy Falls and Terrifying Falls immediately below Windy Falls comprise what kayakers, hikers and waterfallers call one of <b>the</b> most <b>rugged</b> areas in <b>the</b> eastern United States.|$|R

5|$|The journey west usually took {{between four}} and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed by {{following}} a new route called Hastings Cutoff, which crossed Utah's Wasatch Mountains and Great Salt Lake Desert. <b>The</b> <b>rugged</b> terrain and difficulties encountered while traveling along the Humboldt River in present-day Nevada {{resulted in the}} loss of many cattle and wagons, and caused splits within the group.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes {{estimated}} that Argos {{would be easier}} to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> area above the city's theatre. The people of the city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies. The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, {{one of the most famous}} generals of the age, had been killed while trying to take the city.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{and tourism}} {{now account for}} much of the area's economy. <b>The</b> <b>rugged</b> natural scenery, sense of isolation, and natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular {{destination}} for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1942, the Waffen-SS {{formed a}} company {{intended}} for anti-partisan operations in <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> and high-altitude border region between Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia {{known as the}} Karst. SS-Standartenführer (Colonel) Hans Brand, a geologist and speleologist, suggested {{the creation of the}} unit. The company was formed at the SS training centre in Dachau on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian).|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E

Several species, including the Dsinezumi shrew, are found only on Jeju, while many other species, such as the wild boar, are absent or extirpated from there. Some mammals, such as the Manchurian wapiti, are considered natural monuments of North Korea, while others, such as the spotted seal, are considered natural monuments of South Korea.|$|E

As the vanguard company traveled through <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> mountains, they divided into three sections.

The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the designated route.|$|E
5|$|The 25-pounder {{was well}} suited to the open {{conditions}} the Army experienced in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres but proved difficult to deploy in jungle terrain. While the developed road network in Malaya allowed it to be moved by vehicles during the Malayan Campaign, <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> terrain and limited transport infrastructure in New Guinea meant that the guns could only be moved away from coastal plains and airfields by manhandling. As a result, Australian infantry often had no artillery support heavier than 3 inch mortars during the New Guinea Campaign in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Petitcodiac {{river valley}} at Moncton is broad and {{relatively}} flat, bounded {{by a long}} ridge to the north (Lutes Mountain) and by <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> Caledonia Highlands to the south. Moncton lies at the original head of navigation on the river, however a causeway to Riverview (constructed in 1968) resulted in extensive sedimentation of the river channel downstream and rendered the Moncton area of the waterway unnavigable. On 14 April 2010, the causeway gates were opened {{in an effort to}} restore the silt-laden river.|$|E

5|$|The Ridge Route, officially the Castaic-Tejon Route, was a two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Kern counties, California.

Much of the old road runs through the Angeles National Forest, and passes by many historical landmarks, including the National Forest Inn, Reservoir Summit, Kelly's Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg's Summit Hotel. North of the forest, the Ridge Route passed through Deadman's Curve before ending at Grapevine.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse <b>the</b> <b>rugged</b> mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to take their place. Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E
