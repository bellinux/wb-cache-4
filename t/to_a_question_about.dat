At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became {{the subject of}} a controversy because of her response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and that the issue of same-sex marriage was not relevant to the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem but who had regained a sense of their own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers.|$|E

These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. Two important examples of such books are the Siddur of Amram Gaon, addressed to the Jews of Spain in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the laws of prayer, and the Epistle of Sherira Gaon, which sets out {{the history of the}} Mishnah and the Talmud {{in response to a question}} from Tunisia.|$|E
