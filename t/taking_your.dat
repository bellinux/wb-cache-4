The writer commented, [...] "Everything I have put into it is based entirely on fact. It just happens to be a story that not many people are {{familiar}} with."

500|$|In {{the lead}} up to Election Day, Perot {{attended}} a few rallies in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Denver. A major rally was staged in Tampa, and was attended by more than 10,000 supporters. Perot also made stops in Kansas City, Los Angeles and Santa Clara. On the final night, infomercials aired on all three major networks. He held his final campaign event in Dallas outside his headquarters, and thanked his supporters, stating: [...] "What you've been through hasn't been pretty, but by golly, you're <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> country back." [...] At the end, his campaign song [...] "Crazy" [...] by Patsy Cline was played. In the final NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, Perot was in third place with 15%, behind Bush with 36% and Clinton with 44%.|$|E
500|$|HIStory {{received}} generally positive reviews. Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down. This reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It {{has been a long}} time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> dad with you into a fight." [...] Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described [...] "This Time Around", [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "D.S." [...] as [...] "superb slices of organic funk that will fuel many of the summer's busiest dance floors".|$|E

500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> time." [...] He also comments how difficult it was to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it for this moment to have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E
500|$|Kala was {{met with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 37 reviews. In the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers wrote that Kala succeeded at embodying disenfranchised characters in the dissonant Third World with [...] "truly multi-vocal" [...] music whose [...] "every sound signified something different, driving the music's meaning into some new corner". Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club said the music ventured far enough where it served as both a party album and a progressive aural assault, while AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that Kala was better for intensifying Arulars qualities and [...] "mixing cultures with respectful irreverence". Barry Walters of Spin credited M.I.A. with evoking both the social demands and percussive sounds of the Third World, while finding the album relevant {{at a time when}} [...] "more Americans than ever feel like outsiders in their own country". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the lyrics were [...] "cannier politically" [...] than Arular, and the music was more decisive in embodying the imagination and recreation of [...] "an unbowed international underclass that proves how smart it is just by stating its business, which includes <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> money". He later said that he had [...] "pressed" [...] the editors of Rolling Stone to let him give Kala four-and-a-half stars in his review for the magazine, wishing he [...] "had the foresight to fight for five" [...] because the album [...] "kept growing on me till I even dug the Timbaland remnant [...] ".|$|E

Paul mentioned {{he does not}} believe society should let the aforementioned hypothetical man die but emphasized that churches and communities – rather than governments – should take care of those in need.|$|E
2500|$|The South African team {{received}} US$100,000 and {{a trophy}} {{for being the}} champions. Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, handed over the trophy and the cash award. Cronje said: [...] "it feels good to win this tough tournament. There were no second chances in this knock-out format, so I think we did well to play three good matches. We knew we were among the top there, but this has renewed our confidence for next year's World Cup." [...] The West Indian team received US$60,000 for being the runners-up. Lara said: [...] "not many expected us to reach the final but we showed we were good enough for that. I am happy the boys fought till the end, {{it was a very}} close game.

2500|$|Welch {{posed for}} Playboy {{magazine}} in 1979, {{but she never}} did a full nudity photo shoot.

She declined to do complete nudity, and I yielded gracefully. The pictures prove her point." [...] Welch has refused to take all her clothes off on screen or pose naked throughout her career spanning five decades, saying it is the way she has been brought up. While her image in the 1960s was that of a torrid sex temptress, Raquel's private life was quite different. She once famously said: [...] "What I do on the screen is not to be equated with what I do in my private life. Privately, I am understated and dislike any hoopla".|$|E
