40|$|Bidirectional {{replication}} of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome terminates {{at a point}} on the circular chromosome which is symmetrically opposite to the replication origin. Since replication rates are similar in both "halves" of the chromosome, termination presumably occurs at the meeting point of the two replication forks. To investigate whether the DNA sequence of this region of the chromosome contributes to the termination event, we have determined the latest replicating region of a chromosome in which this DNA sequence is no longer symmetrically opposite to the origin. The merodiploid strain GSY 1127 has a very large nontandem duplication (approximately 25 % of the total chromosome length) in the left-hand half of the chromosome, so that size and symmetry of this chromosome are grossly {{different from those of}} normal strains. We have examined the replication order of genetic markers in this strain by measuring subtilis <b>terminal</b> <b>marker</b> for replication remains a <b>terminal</b> <b>marker</b> in the merodiploid, i. e., replicates later than a marker situated symmetrically opposite to the replication origin. These results were supported by replication orders determined by pulse-density transfer experiments during synchronous replication.

40|$|Different {{presynaptic}} neuromodulation {{systems have}} been explored as possible targets to manage neurodegenerative diseases. However, most studies used young adult animals whereas neurodegenerative diseases are prevalent in the elderly. Thus, we now explored by Western blot analysis how the density of different presynaptic markers and receptors changes with aging in rat hippocampal synaptosomes (purified nerve terminals). Compared to synaptosomal membranes from 2 -month-old rats, the density of presynaptic proteins (synaptophysin or SNAP- 25) decreased at 18 - 24 months. In parallel, <b>markers</b> of glutamatergic <b>terminals</b> (vGluT 1 or vGluT 2) and cholinergic <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> (vAChT) constantly decreased with aging from 12 to 18 months onwards, whereas the densities of GABAergic (vGAT) only decreased after 24 months. Inhibitory A 1 and CB 1 receptor density tended to decrease with aging, whereas facilitatory mGluR 5 and P 2 Y 1 receptor density was roughly constant and facilitatory A 2 A receptor density increased at 18 - 24 months. Thus aging causes an imbalance of excitatory versus inhibitory nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> and causes a predominant decrease of inhibitory rather than facilitatory presynaptic modulation systems.

40|$|Presynaptic Ca 2 + {{stores have}} been {{suggested}} to regulate Ca 2 + dynamics within the nerve terminals at certain types of the synapse. However, {{little is known about}} their mode of activation, molecular identity, and detailed subcellular localization. Here, we show that the ryanodine-sensitive stores exist in axons and amplify presynaptic Ca 2 + accumulation at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, which display robust presynaptic forms of plasticity. Caffeine, a potent drug inducing Ca 2 + release from ryanodine-sensitive stores, causes elevation of presynaptic Ca 2 + levels and enhancement of transmitter release from the mossy fiber terminals. The blockers of ryanodine receptors, TMB- 8 or ryanodine, reduce presynaptic Ca 2 + transients elicited by repetitive stimuli of mossy fibers but do not affect those evoked by single shocks, suggesting that ryanodine receptors amplify presynaptic Ca 2 + dynamics in an activity dependent manner. Furthermore, we generated the specific antibody against the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR 2; originally referred to as the cardiac type) and examined the cellular and subcellular localization using immunohistochemistry. RyR 2 is highly expressed in the stratum lucidum of the CA 3 region and mostly colocalizes with axonal marker NF 160 but not with <b>terminal</b> <b>marker</b> VGLUT 1. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that RyR 2 is distributed around smooth ER within the mossy fibers but is almost excluded from their terminal portions. These results suggest that axonal localization of RyR 2 at sites distant from the active zones enables use dependent Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores within the mossy fibers and thereby facilitates robust presynaptic forms of plasticity at the mossy fiber-CA 3 synapse...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{conditions}} {{are associated with}} modified brain function, namely with cognitive deficits, through largely undetermined processes. More than understanding the underlying mechanism, {{it is important to}} devise novel strategies to alleviate diabetes-induced cognitive deficits. Caffeine (a mixed antagonist of adenosine A 1 and A 2 A receptors) emerges as a promising candidate since caffeine consumption reduces the risk of diabetes and effectively prevents memory deficits caused by different noxious stimuli. Thus, we took advantage of a novel animal model of type 2 diabetes to investigate the behavioural, neurochemical and morphological modifications present in the hippocampus and tested if caffeine consumption might prevent these changes. We used a model closely mimicking the human type 2 diabetes condition, NONcNZO 10 /LtJ mice, which become diabetic at 7 – 11 months when kept under an 11 % fat diet. Caffeine (1 g/l) was applied in the drinking water from 7 months onwards. Diabetic mice displayed a decreased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze accompanied by a decreased density of nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> (synaptophysin, SNAP 25), mainly glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporters), and increased astrogliosis (GFAP immunoreactivity) compared to their wild type littermates kept under the same diet. Furthermore, diabetic mice displayed up-regulated A 2 A receptors and down-regulated A 1 receptors in the hippocampus. Caffeine consumption restored memory performance and abrogated the diabetes-induced loss of nerve terminals and astrogliosis. These results provide the first evidence that type 2 diabetic mice display a loss of nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> and astrogliosis, which is associated with memory impairment; furthermore, caffeine consumption prevents synaptic dysfunction and astrogliosis as well as memory impairment in type 2 diabetes...|$|R

Clinical pharmacology suggests that dopaminergic signaling abnormalities {{are part of the}} pathophysiology of TS. Prior molecular imaging studies of nigrostriatal dopaminergic <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> report conflicting results. Our goal was to characterize the distribution of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals in subjects with TS. Methods: Thirty-three adult subjects with TS were studied with PET using [11 C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), a ligand for the type 2 vesicular monoamine transporter, and with [11 C] methylphenidate (MP), a ligand for the plasmalemmal dopamine transporter. Subjects were characterized with standard rating instruments for tic severity, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and attentional deficits. Results: We found no differences between subjects with TS and control subjects in DTBZ and MP binding in any striatal region. There was no correlation between binding measures and clinical variables. Ventral striatal DTBZ and MP binding distributions in subjects with TS were normal. Conclusions: We found no evidence of increased striatal dopaminergic innervation in Tourette syndrome (TS).

40|$|Administration of the ovarian steroid {{estradiol}} in {{male and}} female animals {{has been shown to}} have neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects in a variety of experimental models. In the present study, spinal tissues from dermatomes just above (T 5 - 7, at level) a severe chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) at T 8 were analyzed for expression levels of prodynorphin (PRDN) and phospho-(serine 369) К-opioid receptor (KOR-P) in 17 β estradiol (EB) - and placebo-treated adult male rats. Dynorphin was targeted since 1) it has previously been shown to be elevated post-SCI, 2) intrathecal injection of dynorphin produces several of the same adverse effects seen with a SCI, and 3) its increased expression is known to occur in a variety of different experimental models of central neuropathic pain. A significant elevation of extracellular levels of both PRDN and KOR-P in the placebo-treated SCI group relative to uninjured surgical sham controls was found in spinal tissues above the injury level, indicating increased dynorphin levels. Importantly, the EB-treated SCI group did not show elevations of PRDN levels at 6 weeks post-injury. Immunohistochemical analysis of at level tissues revealed that EB treatment significantly prevented a post-SCI increase in expression of PRDN puncta co-labeling synapsin I, a nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>marker.</b> The dynorphin containing terminals co-labeled vesicular glutamate receptor- 2 (a marker of glutamatergic terminals), a finding consistent with a non-opioid basis for the adverse effects of dynorphin. These results support a beneficial role for EB treatment post-SCI through a reduction in excessive spinal cord levels of dynorphin. Current studies manipulating the timing of the EB treatment post-injury along with specific functional assessments will address whether the beneficial effects are due to EB’s potential neuromodulatory or neuroprotective action...|$|E
40|$|A Grammar Sketch of Kwaraqae is a {{synchronic}} {{linguistic analysis}} of the Kwaraqae language, one of sixty-three languages which {{are part of the}} North Malaita dialect chain in the Solomon Islands. The data was collected at the University of Waikato from urban dwelling Kwaraqae speakers. Although some work has already been done with this language (Deck, 1934, Walter, 1931), the frameworks of analysis and interpretation from these projects are now out-dated, and consequently not as useful for Linguistic Typologists working with Oceanic languages, or those linguists investigating specific language features such as metathesis (Sohn, 1980; Pawley, 1982; Blevins & Garrett, 1998; Baird, 2002; Heinz, 2004). This thesis has addressed both of these issues by firstly recording fresh data, and secondly, by the application of contemporary linguistic descriptive and typological theory and practices to the data. The description sketches the phonological system which has bilabial and palatal glides, labio-velar stops, a basic syllable shape of (C) V(V) (C), and complex syllable transformations such as metathesis and segment deletion which are often combined. Kwaraqae tends towards an isolating agglutinative typology. When constituents are marked, this occurs on the phrasal head. The basic order of the language is SVO. The nominal system displays the alienable /inalienable semantic distinction frequently found in Oceanic languages, a small closed sub-class being locative in function. The verbal system includes inherently transitive and intransitive verbs, where valence is increased by affixation, and decreased by reduplication, although not all verbs fit this pattern. There are intransitive verbs for which a transitive counterpart could not be elicited, and transitive verbs where the valence changing affixes appear to have become fossilised on the verb. Transitive verbs are often, though not always, indexed for their direct objects. Aspect is prominent in Kwaraqae, and is expressed in the verb phrase by an imperfective, a completive and/or a <b>terminal</b> <b>marker.</b> There is a marker of temporal immediacy, and a large group of free form verbal modifiers, all of which occur in the verb phrase.

40|$|Overproduction of amyloid-b (Ab) {{protein in}} the brain has been {{hypothesized}} as the primary toxic insult that, via numerous mechanisms, produces cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cholinesterase inhibition is a primary strategy for treatment of AD, and specific compounds of this class have previously been demonstrated to influence Ab precursor protein (APP) processing and Ab production. However, little information {{is available on the}} effects of rivastigmine, a dual acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, on APP processing. As this drug is currently used to treat AD, characterization of its various activities is important to optimize its clinical utility.

Given previous reports on the effects of APP and Ab on synapses, regulation of APP processing represents a plausible mechanism for the synaptic effects of rivastigmine. To test this hypothesis, we treated degenerating primary cultures with rivastigmine and measured secreted APP (sAPP) and Ab. Rivastigmine treatment increased metabolic activity in these cultured cells, and elevated APP secretion. Analysis of the two major forms of APP secreted by these cultures, attributed to neurons or glia based on molecular weight showed that rivastigmine treatment significantly increased neuronal relative to glial secreted APP.

40|$|While much {{progress}} has been made in understanding the development, differentiation, and organization of the spinal motor system, the complex circuitry that is integrated to determine a motor behavior has yet to be fully understood. The activity of motor neurons is influenced by sensory feedback, excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and supraspinal control from higher brain regions in the CNS. Descending pathways from the cortex and midbrain are involved in the control of voluntary motor output. This is made possible by their projections onto spinal interneurons and, to a degree that varies between species, directly onto motor neurons. However, the somatotopic organization and molecular diversity of supraspinal projection neurons, and the circuitry that underlies their contribution to motor output, remain incompletely understood. The evolutionary emergence of direct descending projections onto motor neurons has been considered to reflect a specialized level of organization for precise control of individual forelimb muscles. Unlike their polysynaptic counterparts, monosynaptic connections represent direct, unfiltered access to the motor neuron circuit. The direct circuit is thought to represent a neural specialization for the increase in fractionated digit movements exhibited by primates and humans. The progressive realization that rodents have a greater degree of manual dexterity than was previously thought has evoked renewed interest in the role of direct supraspinal projections in other mammalian species. Lesion studies in the rodent indicated that, of the two major supraspinal pathways involved in the control of voluntary movement, the rubrospinal tract had a greater role in control of distal forelimb musculature. However, the degree to which this reflected direct projections onto motor neurons was not clear. Earlier anatomical tracing studies in the rat indicated that there are close appositions between labeled rubrospinal axons and motor neurons projecting to intermediate and distal forelimb muscles. To confirm that these contacts correspond to synapses, I developed a viral tracing strategy to visualize projections from the midbrain. Using an established technique of high-magnification confocal imaging combined with co-localization of the rubrospinal synaptic <b>terminal</b> <b>marker,</b> vglut 2, I established the existence of monosynaptic connections from the ventral midbrain at the level of the red nucleus onto a restricted population of forelimb motor neurons at a single spinal level (C 7 -C 8) in the rodent. To determine whether the motor neurons that receive synaptic input correspond to specific motor pool(s), I first established a positional map of forelimb muscle motor pools in the cervical enlargement of the mouse spinal cord. A single motor pool, that which innervates the extensor digitorum muscle, appeared to be situated in the dense dorsolateral termination zone of rubrospinal ventral fibers. The extensor digitorum muscle plays a key role in digit extension and arpeggio movements during skilled reaching. Anterograde labeling of rubrospinal descending fibers combined with retrograde labeling of extensor digitorum motor neurons revealed a direct circuit from the red nucleus onto this population of motor neurons. Surprisingly, neighboring motor pools innervating digit flexor muscles did not receive rubrospinal inputs. Moreover, other modulatory inputs onto motor neurons, including corticospinal, proprioceptive, and cholinergic interneuron afferents did not distinguish between extensor and flexor digitorum motor neurons. My data therefore reveal a previously unrecognized level of motor pool specificity in the direct rubrospinal circuit. The identification of a small number of rubrospinal fibers that project onto extensor digitorum motor neurons suggested a considerable degree of heterogeneity between rubrospinal neurons. I therefore investigated the anatomical and molecular organization of subpopulations of rubrospinal neurons using retrograde labeling to identify subpopulations of rubrospinal neurons projecting, respectively, to cervical and lumbar levels of the spinal cord. Two rubrospinal populations could be identified within the red nucleus: a rostral population of intermingled cervical and lumbar projection neurons which express the Pou transcription factor Brn 3 a, and a caudal population containing segregated cervical and lumbar domains, which co-express Brn 3 a and a novel member of the C 1 q/TNF protein family, C 1 qL 2. Following laser capture microdissection and genetic profiling of these three populations, I identified and validated molecular correlates of the topographic domains within the rodent red nucleus. The transcription factors tshz 3 and mafB are expressed in the caudal cervical domain, whereas the chemokine fam 19 a 4 is restricted to the caudal lumbar domain. KitL is an axon guidance molecule that is expressed in both the rostral population and the caudal cervical population. Finally, I identified two genes, cxcl 13 and gpr 88, that characterize subpopulations within these topographic divisions. Although the functional role of these genes in the establishment of the rubrospinal circuit remains to be determined, the data reveal a high level of molecular heterogeneity within the red nucleus. I hypothesize that this diversity allows rubrospinal neurons to form circuits in a precise and specific manner during development. Overall, my data provide evidence for a novel organization within the rodent motor system in which direct projections from the rubrospinal tract onto motor neurons appear to control a very specific aspect of skilled movement: the stereotypic extension and separation of the digits in preparation for a task requiring digit manipulation. Identifying molecular correlates of the direct rubrospinal population is the logical next step in further understanding the specific circuitry that encodes descending motor commands. My results will provide a basis for the dissection of the rubro-motoneuronal circuit, enabling the establishment of a direct link between neural connectivity and individual muscle control during a skilled movement...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Owing to the {{long-term}} health risks associated with increased adiposity and the limited efficacy of existing anti-obesity agents, there is an urgent need for further development of alternative therapeutic options {{to serve as an}} adjunct to lifestyle measures to address global cardiometabolic risk and thus reduce the risk of developing obesity-related illnesses such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. AIMS/METHODS: The studies presented in this thesis aimed to investigate the effects of novel (CBi antagonist) and existing (metformin) pharmacological agents on components of the metabolic syndrome using in vitro and in vivo models. This was undertaken with in vitro studies of the effect of CBi receptor modulation on white, brown and primary (subcutaneous and omental) pre-adipocyte proliferation, adipogenesis and adipokine production as well as a randomised, double-blind cross-over trial of the effects of metformin on vascular function and metabolic profile in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (in vivo). RESULTS: CBi receptor antagonism inhibited white and primary pre-adipocyte proliferation and increased expression of <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> of adipogenesis while promoting adiponectin production. In young women with PCOS, short term metformin therapy improved arterial stiffness and endothelial function, resulted in modest weight loss and an elevation in serum adiponectin. There is increasing evidence for the key role the latter plays in metabolic processes and vascular health, and these increases in adiponectin levels may underlie some of the mechanisms mediating the changes observed. Therefore treatments targeting a switch inthe adipokine profile as the therapeutic goal represent a new approach to addressing global cardiometabolic risk...|$|R

40|$|Two ETS {{transcription}} {{factors of}} the Pea 3 subfamily are induced in subpopulations of {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) sensory and spinal motor neurons by target-derived factors. Their expression controls late aspects of neuronal differentiation such as target invasion and branching. Here, we show that the late onset of ETS gene expression is an essential requirement for normal sensory neuron differentiation. We provide genetic evidence in the mouse that precocious ETS expression in DRG sensory neurons perturbs axonal projections, the acquisition of <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>markers,</b> and their dependence on neurotrophic support. Together, our findings indicate that DRG sensory neurons exhibit a temporal developmental switch that can be revealed by distinct responses to ETS transcription factor signaling at sequential steps of neuronal maturation...|$|R
40|$|The {{neurotoxic}} potential of amphetamine and related drugs is well documented. However, methylphenidate, an amphetamine derivative {{used in the}} treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and known to increase synaptic dopamine (DA) levels, seems to lack {{neurotoxic potential}}. It is hypothesized that both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are involved in the neurotoxicity of amphetamine derivatives. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of methylphenidate and to test whether stimulation of the serotonergic system may confer neurotoxic properties to methylphenidate for DA or serotonin (5 -HT) neurons. In addition, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the necessity to perform future SPECT studies in individuals using both methylphenidate and 5 -HT-acting agents. We therefore measured monoaminergic transporters in rat brain using radioligands suitable for SPECT imaging ([123 I]beta-CIT and [123 I]FP-CIT). Groups of rats were treated with methylphenidate or saline for 4 days. Additional groups were treated with the selective 5 -HT(2) receptor agonist quipazine or the selective 5 -HT reuptake blocker fluoxetine, alone or in combination with methylphenidate. Binding studies were performed 5 days after the last treatment. In a second experiment, methylphenidate in combination with quipazine, along with a control group, was retested. In this experiment, monoaminergic terminal density was estimated 2 weeks (rather than 5 days) after drug treatment. Five days, but not 2 weeks, after treatment a significant reduction in specific [123 I]FP-CIT binding was observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats treated with methylphenidate in combination with quipazine. These changes probably do not reflect neurotoxic changes of frontal cortex and hippocampal DA <b>terminal</b> <b>markers,</b> but a compensatory downregulation of DA transporters. These findings suggest potential harmful effects of concomitant use of drugs directly activating 5 -HT 2 receptors in patients using methylphenidat...|$|R

Thus, we now tested whether A(2 A) R blockade prevents the early Abeta(1 - 42) -induced synaptotoxicity and memory dysfunction {{and what are the}} underlying signaling pathways.

Moreover, these were synaptic events since purified nerve terminals acutely exposed to Abeta(1 - 42) (500 nm) displayed mitochondrial dysfunction, which was prevented by A(2 A) R blockade.

This A(2 A) R-mediated control of neurotoxicity involved the control of Abeta(1 - 42) -induced p 38 phosphorylation and was independent from cAMP/PKA (protein kinase A) pathway. Together, these results show that A(2 A) Rs {{play a crucial role in}} the development of Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity leading to memory dysfunction through a p 38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) -dependent pathway and provide a molecular basis for the benefits of caffeine consumption in AD.

Using immunofluorescence analysis on patients' biopsy samples, we observed marked nuclear c-Myc accumulation in all layers of the epidermis and oral mucosa in all (3 / 3) dogs analysed. In addition, c-Myc upregulation was accompanied by an increased number of proliferating Ki 67 -positive cells.

40|$|Firemaster® 550 (FM 550) is a {{chemical}} mixture currently {{used as an}} additive flame retardant in commercial products, and is comprised of 2 -ethylhexyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tertrabromobenzoate (TBB), bis(2 -ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and isopropylated triphenyl phosphate (IPTP). Animal and in vitro studies suggest that FM 550, TPP and IPTP may have adipogenic effects and may exert these effects through PPARγ activation. Using murine 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes, we investigated the detailed expression of transcription factors and adipogenic markers in response to FM 550 and its components. Further we investigated the mechanism of action of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) on downstream targets of the receptor by focussing on the mature adipocyte marker, adipocyte protein 2 (aP 2). In addition, we set to elucidate the components responsible for the adipogenic effects seen in the FM 550 mixture. We show that FM 550 and its components TPP, IPTP, and TBPH, but not TBB induced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite displaying enhanced lipid accumulation, TBPH did not alter the mRNA or protein expression of <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>markers.</b> In contrast, FM 550, TPP, and IPTP treatment enhanced lipid accumulation, and mRNA and protein expression of <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>markers.</b> To further delineate the mechanisms of action of FM 550 and its components we focussed on aP 2 promoter activity. For this purpose we used the enhancer region of the mouse aP 2 promoter using a 584 -bp reporter construct containing an active PPRE located 5. 4 kb away from the transcription start site of aP 2. Exposure to FM 550, IPTP, and TPP significantly increased PPARγ mediated aP 2 enhancer activity. Furthermore, we show that TPP- and IPTP-dependent upregulation of aP 2 was significantly inhibited by the selective PPARγ antagonist GW 9662. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IPTP and TPP treatment led to the recruitment of PPARγ to the regulatory region of aP 2...|$|R
40|$|The sex steroid {{progesterone}} {{is essential}} for the proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland epithelium during pregnancy. In relation to this, in vitro studies using breast carcinoma T 47 D cells have demonstrated a biphasic progesterone response, consisting of an initial proliferative burst followed by a sustained growth arrest. However, the transcriptional factors acting with the progesterone receptor (PR) to mediate the progesterone effects on mammary cell growth and differentiation remain to be determined. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP- 132), initially identified as a regulator of steroidogenesis, is also a cell growth suppressor. Similar to progesterone-bound PR, TReP- 132 acts by inducing the gene expression of the G 1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p 21 WAF 1 /Cip 1 (p 21) and p 27 Kip 1 (p 27). The putative interaction between TReP- 132 and progesterone pathways in mammary cells was therefore analyzed in the present study. Our results show that TReP- 132 interacts in vitro and in T 47 D cells with progesterone-activated PR. TReP- 132 synergizes with progesterone-bound PR to trans activate the p 21 and p 27 gene promoters at proximal Sp 1 -binding sites. Moreover, TReP- 132 overexpression and knockdown, respectively, increased or prevented the induction of p 21 and p 27 gene expression by progesterone. As a consequence, TReP- 132 knockdown also resulted in the loss of the inhibitory effects of progesterone on pRB phosphorylation, G 1 /S cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the knockdown of TReP- 132 expression also prevented the induction of both early and <b>terminal</b> <b>markers</b> of breast cell differentiation which had been previously identified as progesterone target genes. As well, the progesterone-induced accumulation of lipid vacuoles was inhibited in the TReP- 132 -depleted cells. Finally, TReP- 132 gene expression levels increased following progesterone treatment, indicating the existence of a positive auto-regulatory loop between PR and TReP- 132. Taken together, these data identify TReP- 132 as a coactivator of PR mediating the growth-inhibitory and differentiation effects of progesterone on breast cancer cells...|$|R

By using a plasmid that only encodes large-T function, the involvement of this individual early viral gene product was determined. Inhibition of myogenic differentiation by Py large T is proportional to the level of its expression. This inhibition does not appear to require alteration of cell growth properties.

MMP- 9 and the <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>marker</b> involucrin were co-localized {{in the same}} keratinocytes with {{a high concentration of}} Ca 2 +, a potent stimulator of differentiation. We identified the novel KRE-M 9 element, further downstream to the previously reported TPA responsive element in the MMP- 9 promoter, and both of these two elements were shown to be important for MMP- 9 transcription and Ca 2 + induction. The concomitant upregulation of MMP- 9 and involucrin transcripts was probably due to the very similar gene regulatory elements, KRE-M 9 and KRE- 4, in their respective promoters. These results indicate a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation for MMP- 9 in the process of keratinization, implying the probable association of apoptosis and differentiation of keratinocytes in epidermal skin tissue...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn the Drosophila ventral nerve cord, a {{small number}} of neurons express the LIM-homeodomain gene apterous (ap).

Here, using several ap neuron <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>markers,</b> we have resolved how each of these factors contributes to ap neuron diversity. We find that these factors interact genetically and biochemically in subtype-specific combinatorial codes to determine certain defining aspects of ap neuron subtype identity. However, we also find that ap, dimmed, and squeeze additionally act independently of one another to specify certain other defining aspects of ap neuron subtype identity. Therefore, within single neurons, we show that single regulators acting in numerous molecular contexts differentially specify multiple subtype-specific traits...|$|R

This study determined the effect of valproic acid (VPA) on HNSCC. Methods: Growth inhibition effects of VPA alone or in combination with 5 -aza- 2 'deoxycytidine (5 -aza-dC) or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was evaluated with MTT and clonogenic assays on 5 HNSCC cell lines. The mechanism of growth inhibition was investigated by looking at <b>markers</b> of <b>terminal</b> differentiation and senescence. Results: Growth inhibition profiles of HNSCC cell lines varied in response to VPA. Inhibition of clonogenic survival in response to VPA was associated with an upregulation of p 21, expression of <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>markers,</b> and cellular senescence. Notably, a combination treatment of 5 -Aza-dC-VPA-ATRA enhanced growth inhibition in cells resistant to VPA.
