Most of his life has been spent in streets and squares, with occasional migrations to the esplanades of fashionable watering-places or the gravelled walks of country house gardens. Now that noblesse is about to impose its obligations on him, quite a new catalogue of wants has sprung into his mind. There are things that a plain esquire may leave undone without causing scandalised remark, but a fiercer light beats on a baron. Trigger-pulling {{is one of the}} obligations. Up to the present Pitherby has never hit a partridge in anger, but this year he has commissioned me to rent him a deer forest. Some pedigree Herefords for his 'home farm' was another commission, and a dozen and a half swans for a swannery. The swannery, I may say, was my idea; I said once in his hearing that it gave a baronial air to an estate; you see I knew a man who had got a lot of surplus swan stock for sale. Now Pitherby wants a heronry as well. I've put him in communication with a client of mine who suffers from superfluous herons, but of course I can't guarantee that the birds' nesting arrangements will fall in with his <b>territorial</b> <b>requirement.</b> I'm getting him some carp, too, of quite respectable age, for a carp pond; I thought it would look so well for his lady-wife to be discovered by interviewers feeding the carp with her own fair hands, and I put the same idea into Pitherby's mind." ...|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for about 64% of the total land area.

5000|$|Unlike American pro teams, Japanese Baseball League {{teams were}} usually named after their {{corporate}} owners/sponsors {{rather than the}} cities or regions in which they played. This was because Japanese franchising does not have strong <b>territorial</b> <b>requirements</b> as in the Major Leagues; as a result, the JBL teams clustered in metropolitan areas in Japan's center (Tokyo, Nagoya) and south (Osaka). As a result, teams were notorious for how often they changed their names, often because of changes in ownership/sponsorship (and also because of nationalistic regulations imposed during wartime, such as the outlawing of English team names). (The Yomiuri Giants, the Chunichi Dragons, and the Hanshin Tigers are the only surviving major clubs that have always been based in their respective cities. Additionally, the current Orix Buffaloes are a merger of two clubs which never left their hometown.) ...|$|R
40|$|The kin {{facilitation}} hypothesis attributes {{red grouse}} population cycles {{to the formation}} of spatial assemblages comprising related territory holders, and to a reduction in aggressiveness within such family clusters. This well-documented process is hypothesised to increase annual recruitment into the territorial population and the resulting increase in density leads to increased aggressiveness within the population. After some years, the cumulative increase in density and aggressiveness is assumed to lead to the breakdown of the family clusters, inflation of <b>territorial</b> <b>requirements</b> and consequent population decline. The territorial dynamics of a single family cluster constitute an important and little investigated part of the hypothesis. We develop a simple deterministic model {{to examine the effects of}} crowding and family size on the formation of a single family cluster. Analysis of two versions of the model, one containing no territory sharing between neighbouring relatives and one containing a territory-sharing response function developed elsewhere, indicates that a continuous increase in crowding has a discontinuous effect on the ability of the cluster to form. In the case of the model containing territory sharing this change is irreversible as, due to the occurrence of multiple equilibria, solutions are sensitive to initial conditions. We discuss the implications of this result for the kin facilitation hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} exacerbates {{the problem}} of habitat loss for grassland and wetland birds. Remaining patches of grasslands and wetlands may be too small, too isolated, and too influenced by edge effects to maintain viable populations of some breeding birds. Knowledge {{of the effects of}} fragmentation on bird populations is critically important for decisions about reserve design, grassland and wetland management, and implementation of cropland set-aside programs that benefit wildlife. In my review of research that has been conducted on habitat fragmentation, I found at least five common problems in the methodology used. The results of many studies are compromised by these problems: passive sampling (sampling larger areas in larger patches), confounding effects of habitat heterogeneity, consequences of inappropriate pooling of data from different species, artifacts associated with artificial nest data, and definition of actual habitat patches. As expected. some large-bodied birds with large <b>territorial</b> <b>requirements,</b> such as the northern harrier (Circus cyaneus), appear area sensitive. In addition, some small species of grassland birds favor patches of habitat far in excess of their territory size, including the Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis), grasshopper (Ammodramus savannarum) and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s (A. henslowii) sparrows, and the bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). Other species may be area sensitive as well, but the data are ambiguous. Area sensitivity among wetland birds remains unknown since virtually no studies have been based on solid methodologies. We need further research on grassland bird response to habitat that distinguishes supportable conclusions from those that may be artifactual...|$|R
40|$|Like other animals, cranes {{exist as}} natural populations that are {{dependent}} upon particular environmental conditions and that vary in population density between the absolute minimum numbers that have permitted survival to relatively dense populations that may approach or even temporarily exceed the carrying {{capacity of the}} habitat. Each species may also have an upper species-typical limit on population density, or 2 ̆ 2 saturation point, 2 ̆ 2 which is independent of the carrying capacity of the habitat but which may be determined by such social adaptations as <b>territorial</b> <b>requirements</b> or individual distance characteristics. Within crane populations, individual birds or families remain within home ranges or geographic areas in which their movements are limited and within which they may {{spend much of their}} lives. Part of the occupied area may be defended from intrusion by conspecifics for varying periods; these areas of local social dominance range from individual distances to territories and probably play important roles in determining space requirements for crane populations. During periods of the year when breeding or wintering territories are not held, as during migration, dominance hierarchies serve to integrate the activities of the family and flock, and may likewise play important roles in population behavior and ecology. Interspecific differences in morphology and innate behavior patterns may further dictate specific foraging niches for each species, and these too may be of importance in regulating potential population sizes in cranes and in determining competition levels with other species...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been focussed {{on the use of}} consumption-based approaches to energy accounting via input-output (IO) methods. Of particular interest is the examination of energy supply chains, given the associated risks from supply-chain issues, including availability shocks, taxes on fossil fuels and fluctuating energy prices. Using a multiregional IO (MRIO) database to calculate energy consumption-based accounts (CBA) allows analysts to both determine the quantity and source of energy embodied in products along the supply chain. However, it is recognised in the literature that there is uncertainty as to the most appropriate type of energy data that should be employed in an IO framework. Questions arise as to whether an energy extension vector should show where the energy was extracted or where it was used (burnt). In order to address this gap, we undertake the first empirical MRIO analysis of an energy CBA using both vectors. Our results show that both the energy-extracted and energy-used vectors produce similar estimates of the overall energy CBA for the UK—notably 45 % higher than <b>territorial</b> energy <b>requirements.</b> However, at a more granular level, the results show that the type of vector that should be employed ultimately depends on the research question that is considered. For example, the energy-extracted vector reveals that just 20 % of the UK’s energy CBA includes energy extracted within the UK, an issue that is upmost importance for energy security policy. At the other end, the energy-used vector allows for the attribution of actual energy use to industry sectors, thereby enabling a better understanding of sectoral efficiency gains. These findings are crucial for users and developers of MRIO databases who undertake energy CBA calculations. Since both vectors appear useful for different energy questions, the construction of robust and consistent energy-used and energy-extracted extension vectors as part of commonly-used MRIO model databases is encouraged...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the national mapping program «CARGNew Italian Geological Map at 1 : 50. 000 scale», Regione Lombardia is generating a detailed map (1 : 10. 000 scale) of its territory. Surveying criteria have been carefully defined in order to produce homogeneous geological maps: geological survey has been performed at the 1 : 10. 000 scale, and data have been stored in a GIS-oriented database. The detailed survey scale improved the geological knowledge: the new maps represent an important tool for <b>territorial</b> planning <b>requirements</b> of public administrations and engineering geologists (e. g. in hydrogeological and seismic risk evaluation). Field geologists performed data input in the geological data base by alternating field campaigns and data input throughout the year, taking advantage of periods when field activities are slackened (i. e. according to climate conditions). In this way, data entry is nearly synchronous with data collection, and field data become quickly accessible. Data entry by the field geologists on one side slows down the field activity, however, it guarantees a precise digitalization of geometric data and a correct attribute assignment, allowing to optimize working time. To allow the data entry to non-GIS-specialized users, we developed an ArcView®-VisualBasic®-MSAccess® application, enabling the simultaneous acquisition of geometric and alphanumeric data. Data base management and cartographic production are performed with ArcInfo®, through specific procedures which, after data reorganization and control (both alphanumeric and geometric), lead to the final cartographic output at different scales. The 1 : 10. 000 geological database is migrated in the ArcSDE structure and prepared for data view, query and download (www. cartografia. regione. lombardia. it/cargweb) using ESRI (ArcIMS) tools. From the 1 : 10. 000 geological database we derived the database for the 1 : 50. 000 CARG maps by both automatic and manual generalization according to the CARG-APAT standards. During the different phases of the project, several problems arose, due to both project organization and data storage system (from data collection in the field to elaboration and digitalization, and, in case, to final publication). – Data collection: the survey activity was divided between «bedrock » and «quaternary» specialists. The double survey provided a high-quality geological description of the territory, but slowed the generation of the data-flow. Based on this experience, the last assigned areas are surveyed by a single geologist, under the supervision of quaternary and bedrock experts. – Users feedback: geologists are normally used to draw their maps on paper; learning how to produce electronic maps can be difficult, and the software tools have to be studied very carefully and present user friendly interfaces. Nevertheless, in our experience, a training period has to be planned, and geologists have to be supported by a GIS expert, who can understand their needs and modify the software accordingly. – System architecture: the ArcView®-VisualBasic®-MSAccess® (Windows platform) – ArcInfo® (UNIX platform) environment, revealed problems in the client-server stability of an earlier version; some unsolved troubles remain, mainly related to the network architecture. The presence in the CARG-Regione Lombardia crew of consultant geologists, experienced and trained in collection, analysis and data entry in the final database, accelerated the critical phases of: – Data base derivation from Regione Lombardia dataset to CARG-APAT standard...|$|R
5000|$|In 1928, the BMA was reorganised {{along the}} lines of the <b>Territorial</b> Army. Training <b>requirements</b> became a weekly drill night, plus an annual two week camp. All of its enlisted men were discharged, and the unit slowly began to rebuild its {{strength}} through new recruitment. By 1930 it had been decided to remove the last of the regular RGA detachments, and to close all of the batteries except the Examination Battery at Saint David's Head, which the BMA assumed complete responsibility for operating. In 1930, a new voluntary unit, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, was raised. responsible for manning the search light detachment at Saint David's Head (and in 1940 it also absorbed the BVRC signals element, providing wireless communications for the garrison). That year, the War Office also ceased funding annual camps outside of the British Isles, citing a lack of funds, and the Bermuda government began funding training.In 1936, on the occasion of the death of King George V, the BMA was involved in what could have been a severe international incident. The BMA had been instructed to fire a memorial salute from one of the two 4.7" [...] guns at Saint David's Battery. This salute was to consist of seventy blank rounds, one for each year of the King's life, fired at one-minute intervals. Because of the difficulty of storing ammunition in Bermuda's humid climate, there proved to be only twenty-three rounds of blank ammunition in stock, and the remainder used were all headed ammunition. As the firing was to commence at 8am (on 21 January), and it was thought unlikely any vessels would be in the danger area, it was decided to proceed with the salute, ensuring the guns were elevated for maximum range (8,000 yards), out to sea. The firing began at 08:00, and was over seventy minutes later. What the BMA gunners were unaware of, however, was that a Colombian Navy destroyer, the ARC Antioquia, was at the receiving end of their barrage. The destroyer. built in Portugal by a British company, was under the command of a retired Royal Naval officer (part of the British Naval Mission to Colombia), and was arriving at Bermuda to undergo repairs at the HM Dockyard. Although the ship's crewmembers were alarmed to find themselves on the receiving end of an artillery barrage, the ship fortunately was not hit.|$|R
