Of the episode, Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said, [...] "As I'm {{realizing how}} much I'm thoroughly enjoying the characters on Body of Proof, [...] "Helping Hand" [...] has Megan finally noticing how little she knows about them. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is,</b> she does something {{to try and}} change that {{and the results are}} both comical and touching". Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing makes you a part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship".

She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners". Finally, she was glad it was not too [...] "gory" [...] and summarized, [...] "On Body of Proof I'm more interested in the characters than the graphic medical details. Thankfully they continue to give me plenty of what I want". TV OverMind Carissa Pavlica said she was [...] "really enjoying" [...] the relationship between Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) and Megan.

[...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Ms. Sharma has made a specialty of characters like Aisha: independent urban women, whose dreams involve careers as well as love. Her Aisha is a nuanced creation— ambitious, sympathetic, believable— and Mr. Mukerji, making his directing debut, is right to let her run away with the film." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} a {{pleasant}} party, and while we were writing, we had a bird's-eye view of the public reception of the Chief Justice. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>part</b> of it <b>were</b> some natives in war array; with blacked faces, turbans, tapa kilts, and guns, they looked very manly and purposelike. No, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>was</b> poor old drunken Joe, the Portuguese boatman, who seemed to think himself specially charged with the reception, and ended by falling on his knees before the Chief Justice {{on the end of}} the pier and in full view of the whole town and bay. The natives pelted him with rotten bananas; how the Chief Justice took it I was too far off to see; but it was highly absurd.|$|R
