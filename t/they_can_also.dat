5|$|However, black {{wildebeest}} {{can also}} affect human beings negatively. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to take individual higher education courses in Commerce from the Business School in Kambsdalur and in Tórshavn. The alumni can work {{at the same time}} and take one course each semester. After three years they will have achieved 60 ECTS which is the same as the first part of the HD education. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> take the second part of the HD education from the Business College, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> combine it with courses from the Aarhus University via distant education. If they wish to study further for at MBA they must take it from a university in Denmark, i.e. the Aarhus University.|$|E

5|$|Mole crickets evade predators {{by living}} below ground, and vigorously {{burrowing}} if disturbed at the surface. As a last-ditch defence, they eject a foul-smelling brown liquid from their anal glands when captured; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> bite.|$|E
5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species {{is found in the}} eastern states of Australia, mostly on the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> {{be grown}} in a {{front of a}} mixed border, or rockery.As well as being {{naturalized}} in the garden, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> grown in containers, {{as long as they}} are well watered.

5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E
5|$|Amateur astronomers {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy and {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be chestnut or red roan, {{similar to the}} Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois {{is known for its}} power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E
50|$|Besides their similar morphology, graminoids {{share the}} {{widespread}} occurrence and often dominance in open habitats such as grasslands or marshes. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> however <b>also</b> {{be found in}} the understory of forests. Sedges and rushes tend to prefer wetter habitats than grasses.|$|R
50|$|Tobacco {{contains}} the alkaloid nicotine, {{which is a}} stimulant. Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.|$|R

5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Chicken {{hearts are}} {{considered}} to be giblets, and are often grilled on skewers: Japanese hāto yakitori, Brazilian churrasco de coração, Indonesian chicken heart satay. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, they can be used, finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken. Many recipes combined them with other giblets, such as the Mexican pollo en menudencias and the Russian ragu iz kurinyikh potrokhov.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
