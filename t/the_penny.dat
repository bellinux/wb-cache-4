5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> was a small silver coin {{rarely seen}} in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1901, {{the period in}} which the House of Hanover reigned, saw its {{transformation}} from a little-used small silver coin to the bronze piece recognisable to modern-day Britons, by 1901 struck in the tens of millions each year. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia on the reverse.|$|E
5|$|The old bronze penny was {{slated for}} {{elimination}} as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It {{continued to be}} struck after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc alloy was used again for the 1960s pennies. Finally, there was an issue of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. The longstanding depiction of Britannia on <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> was translated by sculptor Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.|$|E

5|$|The reverse design had in 1895 been {{modified}} by Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. Following Queen Victoria's death in 1901, de Saulles was {{called upon to}} create a design for the obverse featuring Edward VII. This appeared on <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> in 1902, and remained in use until the year of King Edward's death, 1910. An obverse design by Sir Bertram Mackennal depicting George V went into use in 1911, and remained with some modification until {{the year of the}} King's death, 1936. No pennies were produced for commerce in 1933, as there were a sufficient number in circulation. At least seven were struck that year, mostly for placement beneath foundation stones and in museums; they are valuable today. Edward VIII's short reign is only represented by a single pattern coin, dated 1937. That year, a new obverse design depicting George VI by Humphrey Paget went into use. During the Second World War period of 1941 to 1943, pennies were struck only for the colonies; these are all dated 1940, the most recent year of production for the United Kingdom. After the war, demand for <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> began to diminish. Most of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, with many retrieved from circulation and repatriated by British coin dealers because of their relative scarcity.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, {{officials}} at the Royal Mint planned for new coins, to bear {{the image of her}} son and successor, Edward VII. New coin designs had been introduced in the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the British people wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (<b>the</b> <b>penny,</b> halfpenny and farthing), as a new portrait of the Queen had been introduced in 1895. At that time, the Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles, had modified Leonard Charles Wyon's depiction of Britannia on the reverse of the bronze coins—the lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was ready in May 1902.|$|E

5|$|From 1840 to 1844, <b>the</b> <b>Penny</b> Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by {{the example of the}} British postal system, which issued its first stamp, <b>the</b> <b>Penny</b> Black, in 1840, the Belgian government supported the inauguration of a Belgian equivalent. Under the existing system, postage costs were paid by the receiver rather than the sender, which discouraged people from receiving, and therefore sending, letters. The idea of postage stamps, which would allow the sender to pay in advance, was officially sanctioned by Leopold I on the Loi apportant des modifications au régime des postes ("Law bringing modifications to the postal system") on 24 December 1847 while the radical liberal and future Prime Minister, Walthère Frère-Orban, served as Minister of Public Works. The debate on the reform of the postage in Belgium occurred {{at the same time as}} widespread postage reform, {{influenced by}} the British example, in France, Bavaria and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The grounds {{include a}} gorge {{cut by the}} Hazel Brook through Bristol's limestone. The gorge {{has a number of}} {{landscape}} features, including Goram's Chair, a limestone outcrop often used by climbers, and Lover's Leap and Potter's Point, two panoramic viewing spots. Stratford Mill was moved from West Harptree and re-erected within the gorge after Chew Valley Lake was flooded to form a reservoir. Ongoing renovations started in 2004 of the mill, settling ponds and associated estate pathways. At the gorge's southern end, Hazel Brook joins the River Trym, which continues its flow towards Sea Mills. Other features within the estate include two pools: the Giant's Soapdish and <b>the</b> <b>Penny</b> Well, and two caves: the Robber's Cave and the Butcher's Cave.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{calls for a}} public competition, William Wyon's son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen {{interest}} in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the recall of the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. <b>The</b> <b>penny,</b> removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E

On November 4, 2010, Sega held a Sonic Colors-themed ice-skating event at Bryant Park in New York City. BradyGames also published an official strategy guide, which launched alongside the game. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted multiple Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores to increase {{the value of the}} brand. Sonic Colors was first released in PAL regions on November 11, 2010, followed by a North American release on November 16, 2010 and in Japan on November 18, 2010. People who pre-ordered the Japanese version of the game received a special card compatible with the arcade game Rekishi Taisen Gettenka, allowing Sonic to appear in the game. Those who who pre-ordered the game through GameStop in North America received a Sonic shaped hat. A special edition was also sold in Europe, featuring figurines of Sonic and the Wisps.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded William Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{that the}} state of the copper {{currency}} demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, and it had been used in France since 1852. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed <b>the</b> <b>penny</b> to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of the waves, and to omit her would be seen as abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt & Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton's was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt's prepared to execute its huge contract.|$|E
