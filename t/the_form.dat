40|$|AbstractThe {{stretching}} {{tests of}} the commercial AZ 31 Mg alloy were conducted at 130  °C, 170  °C, 210  °C, at <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> speeds of 10  mm/min and 50  mm/min, respectively. The formability of AZ 31 sheets at high temperature was evaluated by forming limit diagrams (FLD). The fracture morphologies were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} FLD of AZ 31 Mg alloy is affected by <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> temperature, in another word, the formability increases with the increasing of <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> temperature. That may be because the non-basal slip system starts to move by thermal activation at high forming temperature. It is also demonstrated that the formability of the AZ 31 Mg alloy is on the decline with the increasing of <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> speed. <b>The</b> slipping performs thoroughly to release the stress during the deformation if <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> speed decreases. In addition, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> temperature is, <b>the</b> more obvious the effect of <b>the</b> <b>forming</b> speed is. <b>The</b> <b>forming</b> temperature is <b>the</b> main dominating factor on the formability of AZ 31 Mg alloy...|$|R
