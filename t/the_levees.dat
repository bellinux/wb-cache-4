5|$|In a June 2006 {{report on}} the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{admitted}} that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to {{the damage done to}} New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 concluded that two-thirds of the flooding in the city could have been avoided if <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> had held.|$|E
5|$|The eye of Hurricane Katrina was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the city of New Orleans. In that event, the wind was predicted to come from the north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from Lake Pontchartrain against <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach , with waves reaching 7feet (2m) above the storm surge.|$|E
5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along <b>the</b> <b>levees.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{future of}} <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> however, remains uncertain. Management of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> falls to Big Creek Drainage District No. 2. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers no longer {{considers}} <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> in its programs, making it ineligible for federal funding.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{activation}} of the floodway was in January 1937. [...] The river over-topped <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> but did not erode it enough to activate the floodway. [...] Dynamite was used to destroy <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> and activate <b>the</b> system. [...] The Corps rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> back to <b>the</b> original standards and it was left untouched until 1983. [...] In 1983 they upgraded <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> to {{what is known as}} a [...] "fuse-plug design." [...] They laid [...] of pipe that they can fill with liquid explosives and detonate to open <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> and activate <b>the</b> floodway.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the economic benefits}} of a <b>levee</b> constructed for <b>the</b> purposes of flood damage reduction in Mankato, Minnesota. The study also analyzes social benefits of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> by assessing <b>the</b> demographic changes after the creation of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Four analyses were developed to analyze {{the economic and social}} benefits of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> <b>The</b> first analysis was developed to evaluate property value. A second analysis was developed to evaluate tax revenue. A third analysis was developed to evaluate economic benefits of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> A fourth analysis was developed to assess population change after the creation of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> <b>The</b> calculation of property value focused on all land and buildings in flood zones while the calculation of tax revenue focused on buildings in the flood zones that were built after <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> project started. <b>The</b> overall results show <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> plays a significant role in protecting the economic well being of the city of Mankato. Results also show despite decreases in population in the flood zones, the overall population of the city of Mankato has increased significantly after the construction of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> system...|$|R
5|$|In Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards {{declared}} a state of emergency. About 1.25million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana, while approximately 60,000others fled parishes in southwest Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation from Grand Isle was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council. In New Orleans, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000residents in the low-lying areas of the city. Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by thousands of people. In response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top <b>the</b> <b>levees,</b> workers closed 111floodgates. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250members of the Louisiana National Guard patrolled the streets during the storm. The Red Cross assisted with opening a shelter at the University of Southwest Louisiana's Cajundome in Lafayette, equipped to handle about 2,000people.|$|E
5|$|In South Carolina, {{strong winds}} and large waves {{impacted}} the Charleston area. A number of homes were destroyed, forcing some occupants {{to ride out}} the storm completely exposed to the weather. Waves overtopped <b>the</b> <b>levees,</b> flooding army camps along the coast. On September18, two schooners were capsized in the Lower Potomac River. Crops were also destroyed in the area, while a railroad bridge was carried away. A ship was demasted off Cove Point in Chesapeake Bay on September18. Heavy rainfall in Pennsylvania resulted in flooding along the Delaware River and Lehigh Canal, especially in Easton. In Jim Thorpe, then known as Mauch Chunk, three bridges washed away, while a dam was destroyed. In New York City, gale force winds were observed at harbor.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed following Hurricane Katrina {{because of the}} devastation caused by the storm {{and the collapse of}} <b>the</b> <b>levees.</b> Many of the exteriors were set to be shot in New Orleans, including a key sequence involving the Canal Street Ferry across the Mississippi River. After the city was reopened, the cast and crew returned to New Orleans to continue filming. Some scenes of the post-Katrina devastation were worked into the plot, including those in the Lower 9th Ward; additionally, evidence of Katrina's impact on the city was worked into the script.Deja Vu starts production in New Orleans|work= USA Today|date= February 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-19|quote= |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-02-02-deja-vu_x.htm}} The filming crew spent two weeks filming a scene at the Four Mile Bayou in Morgan City, Louisiana.|$|E
50|$|On June 27, 2008, muskrat holes {{weakened}} a Mississippi River levee, allowing floodwaters to {{pour into}} Lincoln County, Missouri. <b>The</b> <b>levee</b> was <b>the</b> last one remaining in Lincoln County and was protecting about 100 homes. Sheriff's deputies alerted residents to evacuate. Sirens also went off to warn residents of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> breach. Muskrats looking for food or making dens had dug into <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> weakening it enough for <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> to breach.|$|R
50|$|A levee {{was erected}} in 1867 {{to protect the}} {{settlement}} from river flooding. <b>The</b> <b>levee</b> was locally financed, and subsequent improvements to <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> were made. A ferry landing was located at the settlement, with a ramp which permitted vehicles to pass {{over the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 17 December 2010, Tasmanian Aboriginals {{set up camp}} on <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> {{and vowed}} not to budge as bulldozers rolled in. They named <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> [...] "Kutalayna".|$|R
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{initially}} expected {{to move into}} the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed. There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> in New Orleans {{might not be able to}} withstand a strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not. A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price of oil to increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded.|$|E
5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the {{increased}} prosperity in the 1860s, this decade {{was also the}} scene of a series of natural disasters. In the Great Flood of 1862, heavy rains dropped by a series of winter storms caused the Santa Ana to burst its banks, flooding thousands of acres of land and killing 20 to 40 people in the greatest flood it had experienced in recorded history. <b>The</b> <b>levees</b> along the river burst in many places, flooding part of the Inland Empire into a continuous body of water several miles wide stretching from the mouth of Santa Ana Canyon to where the river cuts through the Santa Ana Mountains. Downstream in Orange County, the river overwhelmed nearly all the existing floodworks and transformed the coastal plain into a transient inland sea. The flow, now calculated as a 1,000-year flood, peaked at roughly , over half the average flow of the Mississippi River. Even after the flood, detrimental conditions continued in the region. For the two years following the flood, an intense drought caused the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} head of livestock. Despite all of the hardships experienced in the three years, after conditions finally returned to normal, the Santa Ana River watershed again became a prospering agricultural region. The cities of Santa Ana and Riverside were established in 1869 and 1870, respectively.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War the {{retreating}} German Army placed mines in the nearby roads, a barrel with trinitrotoluene on <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> (<b>the</b> explosives were originally supposed to be placed into <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> piping, but it was sealed with concrete due to an order to protect it from a sabotage), and also placed some machine guns in the house of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> guard Šikula. <b>The</b> guard, together with a few people hidden in the power plant room, warned a convoy of the Red Army, but Šikula was shot and wounded. There is a plaque of his at <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> today.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes levees {{are said}} to fail when water overtops the crest of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Levee {{overtopping}} can be caused when flood waters simply exceed the lowest crest of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> system or if high winds begin to generate significant swells (a storm surge) in the ocean or river water to bring waves crashing over <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Overtopping can lead to significant landside erosion of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> or even be the mechanism for complete breach. Often levees are armored or reinforced with rocks or concrete to prevent erosion and failure.|$|R
50|$|Trees in levees are {{a special}} risk. A tree can become {{unstable}} after {{the soil of}} <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> has become saturated with water. When the tree falls the root system will likely take {{a chunk of the}} saturated soil out of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> This shallow hole can quickly erode and result in a breach. If the tree falls in the water and floats away it can damage <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> further downstream. Floating trees near levees should be quickly removed by the agency responsible for the maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b>|$|R
25|$|The asphalt ramps to {{the tops}} of <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> still exist, but have fallen into disrepair.|$|E
25|$|A {{breach in}} the canal's levees {{resulted}} in the flooding of the Lower 9th Ward during Hurricane Betsy in 1965. Subsequently, concrete floodwalls were constructed to replace <b>the</b> <b>levees.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even as {{scientific}} {{knowledge about the}} Mississippi River has grown, upstream development {{and the consequences of}} <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> have caused more severe flooding in some years. Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> have changed the nature of the river. Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current. The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.|$|E
50|$|In flood control, a {{different}} type of relief well is used adjacent to earthen <b>levees</b> to relieve <b>the</b> pressure on the lake or river side of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> and thus to prevent the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> <b>The</b> greater flow of water in the water source, typically during a flood, creates a pressure gradient such that more water infiltrates the soil of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Water may then flow through the soil towards the dry side of <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> resulting in sand boil, liquefaction of the soil, and ultimately destruction of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Relief wells act like valves to relieve the water pressure and allow excess water to be diverted safely, for example, to a canal. Relief wells can prevent sand boils from occurring by relieving the water pressure as described.|$|R
50|$|On July 2, the Corps of Engineers {{awarded a}} $1.4 million {{contract}} {{to shore up}} the 9 miles km levee system around Eppley Airfield with a seepage berm to allow water to seep through <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> but hold <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> materials in place. The action came after the Corps reported there were multiple sand boils on the airport side of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{reporter}} for WGEM-TV, the NBC affiliate in Quincy, questioned Scott {{as he was}} walking <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Scott said that he'd seen a weak spot on <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> and tried to put more sandbags along it. He then said he went for a drink, only {{to come back and}} discover <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> had let go. He then helped the Coast Guard load boats into the floodwaters.|$|R
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Levees</b> Broke (2006), a {{documentary}} about the Katrina disaster directed by Spike Lee, was produced and shown on HBO. The film covered damage in the Lower Ninth Ward and {{other areas of the}} city.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made {{landfall}} {{just east}} of New Orleans, the fifth deadliest hurricane and the costliest natural disaster {{in the history of}} the United States. Multiple breaches in <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> of at least four canals resulted in catastrophic flooding in a majority of the city; see Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{distance}} from areas where <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> were breached during Hurricane Katrina (2005) {{as well as}} the strength and height of the nearest river levees in contrast to other waterway levees or flood walls, Katrina flood damage was relatively light in the Quarter as compared with other areas {{of the city and the}} greater region.|$|E
50|$|Newport on <b>the</b> <b>Levee</b> is a {{shopping}} center located on Third Street in Newport, Kentucky. It is located adjacent to the Purple People Bridge along the Ohio River and has a view of Ohio River. <b>The</b> <b>Levee</b> is only one block away from the East Row Historic District and the Monmouth Street Historic District. It is named after <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> that it rests on.|$|R
50|$|Many {{residents}} that {{reside in}} Gardenland argue that Gardenland is from Bowman Ave to Columbus Ave surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> and Northgate Boulevard, with Bowman Ave {{as the center}} because {{of the park and}} <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sometimes levees {{are said}} to fail when water overtops the crest of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> This will cause {{flooding}} on the floodplains, but {{because it does not}} damage <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> it has fewer consequences for future flooding.|$|R
25|$|Experts using {{computer}} modeling at Louisiana State University after Hurricane Katrina {{have concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> were never topped but rather faulty design, inadequate construction, {{or some combination of}} the two were responsible for the flooding of most of New Orleans: some canal walls leaked underneath, because the wall foundations were not deep enough in peat-subsoil to withstand the pressure of higher water.|$|E
25|$|According to Professor Raymond Seed of the University of California, Berkeley, a {{surge of}} water {{estimated}} at 24feet (7m), about 10feet (3m) higher than the height of <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> along the city's eastern flank, swept into New Orleans from the Gulf of Mexico, causing most of the flooding in the city. He said that storm surge from Lake Borgne travelling up the Intracoastal Waterway caused the breaches on the Industrial Canal.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{failed to}} fully fund an upgrade {{requested}} during the 1990s by the Army Corps of Engineers, and funding {{was cut in}} 2003-04 despite a 2001 study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency warning that a hurricane in New Orleans {{was one of the}} country’s three most likely disasters. Raising and reinforcing <b>the</b> <b>levees</b> to resist a Category 5 hurricane might take 25 years to complete. Some estimates place the cost at $25 billion.|$|E
50|$|A breach can be {{a sudden}} or gradual failure that is caused either by surface erosion or by a {{subsurface}} failure of <b>the</b> <b>levee.</b> Levee breaches are often accompanied by levee boils, or sand boils. The underseepage resurfaces on the landside, {{in the form of}} a volcano-like cone of sand. Boils signal a condition of incipient instability which may lead to erosion of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> toe or foundation or result in sinking of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> into <b>the</b> liquefied foundation below. Some engineers think that boils lead to a form of internal erosion called piping which undermines <b>the</b> <b>levee,</b> but others consider them a symptom of generalized instability of the foundation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> R2 <b>levee</b> {{system is}} {{functionally}} complete - <b>The</b> R2 <b>Levee</b> System {{is designed to}} provide Bound Brook with protection from a 150-year flood level. <b>The</b> <b>levee</b> is built to the height of the raised Talmage Avenue Bridge.|$|R
2500|$|In {{comments}} in 2005, Farrakhan stated {{that there was}} a [...] hole under one of <b>the</b> key <b>levees</b> that failed in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. He implied that <b>the</b> <b>levee's</b> destruction was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the population of the largely black sections within the city. Farrakhan later said that New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin told him of the crater during a meeting in Dallas, Texas. Farrakhan further claimed that <b>the</b> fact <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> broke <b>the</b> day after Hurricane Katrina is proof that the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> was not a natural occurrence. Farrakhan has raised additional questions and has called for federal investigations into the source of <b>the</b> <b>levee</b> break. He also asserted that the hurricane was [...] "God's way of punishing America for its warmongering and racism".|$|R
