40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{readability}} of Japanese sentences. Experiment I was conducted in order to test the effect of the percentage of Chinese charcters and the presentation of the theme in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> on <b>the</b> subjects' reading time. The subjects were 60 college students. On the basis of the percentage of Chinese characters in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> and <b>the</b> presentation of the theme of <b>the</b> <b>sentences,</b> they were randomly assigned to one of the following six groups : High-theme, High-no theme, Middle-no theme, Non-theme, Non-no theme. They were asked to read <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> shown by a slide projector on a paper and the time to read <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> was recorded. For the subjects of the 'theme' groups the theme was told before they started reading <b>the</b> <b>sentences.</b> <b>The</b> reading time in the High groups was significantly shorter than that in the 'Non'groups. This suggests that the words written in Chinese characters in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> have facilitating effect on the readability of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>sentences.</b> No significant difference was observed between the 'theme' groups and the 'no theme' groups. The result made it clear that there were very similar words like the theme in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> shown for <b>the</b> 'no theme' groups. Experiment 2 was designed in order to test again the effect of the presentation of the theme on the subjects' reading time. The subjects were 20 college students. They were asked to read <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> written only in hiragana (not containing Chinese charcters) on a paper. The 'theme' group took more reading time that in the 'no theme' group, but in reading <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> <b>the</b> subjects of the 'theme' group made fewer mistakes than the subjects of the 'no theme' group. The findings suggest that the theme presented for the subjects facilitated to recognize the words in <b>the</b> <b>sentences.</b> but it took more time for them to correspond the contents or the words of <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> with <b>the</b> theme...|$|R

40|$|Many U. S. {{district}} court judges have expressed dissatisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> guidelines.

Specifically, under <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> guidelines, {{district court}} judges take senior status. 4 years after becoming eligible to do so. Without <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> guidelines, district court judges would select senior status 3 years after becoming eligible. ...|$|R
