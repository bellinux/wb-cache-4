5|$|In 2004, {{proposals}} {{to widen the}} highway to six lanes between Downingtown and Valley Forge were made. In 2007, the western terminus of <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> project was scaled back from Downingtown to the proposed PA 29 slip ramp. Plans for <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> were presented {{to the public in}} 2009. Later that year, <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> was put on hold because of engineering problems. <b>The</b> <b>widening</b> plans resumed in 2010. Work was due to begin in 2013, with completion in 2015. In October 2012, the project was postponed a year because of delays in the approval of permits.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} idea for constructing {{a replacement for}} Mission Avenue dates from 1950. By 1961, there were plans to make SR76 a freeway from Oceanside to Fallbrook Road, and an expressway from there to US395. The following year, the new Highway 76 Association formed a committee to promote the upgrade of the road into Pauma Valley. In 1963, more specific plans were proposed by the Highway Development Association initiative, including making the portions from Foussat Road and the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and from Vista Way to Mission Road an expressway, and making {{the part of the}} highway in Oceanside wider. In 1964, the state allocated funds for <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> of SR76 to four lanes in Oceanside, and in October1965, the first portion of <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> from Carey Road to Frontier Drive entered the bidding phase. The next part of <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> entered the bidding phase in December 1968, and extended from Frontier Drive to near the Mission.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe common {{challenges}} for constructing embankments on soft clay include low bearing capacity, large total and differential settlements, and slope instability. Different techniques {{have been adopted}} to improve soft clay, {{such as the use}} of foundation columns including stone columns, deep mixed columns, and vibro-concrete columns, etc. Due to increased traffic volume, column-supported embankments may be <b>widened</b> to accommodate <b>the</b> traffic capacity need. Adding a new embankment to an existing embankment generates additional stresses and deformations under not only <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> portion but also the existing embankment. Differential settlements between and within the existing embankment and <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> portion may cause pavement distresses. Limited research has been conducted so far to investigate widening of column-supported embankments. In this study, a two-dimensional finite difference numerical method was adopted. This numerical method was first verified against field data and then used for <b>the</b> analysis of <b>widened</b> column-supported embankments over soft clay. The modified Cam-Clay model was used to model the soil under the existing embankment and <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> portion. Mechanically and hydraulically coupled numerical models were created to consider the consolidation of the foundation soil under the existing embankment and <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> portion. Different layouts of foundation columns under the existing embankment and <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> portion were investigated. The numerical results presented in this paper include the vertical and horizontal displacements, the maximum settlements, the transverse gradient changes, and the stress concentration ratios, which depended on column spacing. The columns installed under the connection side slope were most effective in reducing the total and differential settlements, horizontal displacement, and transverse gradient change of <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> embankment...|$|R

40|$|Observational and {{three-dimensional}} modeling studies {{reveal that}} the intensified upwelling in the northeastern South China Sea (NSCS) {{is formed as a}} result of intensified upslope advection of dense deep waters that cross the middle shelf toward the inner shelf over a distinctly eastward <b>widened</b> shelf. <b>The</b> strongest advection occurs over the converging isobaths near the head of <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> shelf. As these dense deep waters advance shoreward, they are advected downstream by the quickly developed upwelling current over the inner shelf and eventually outcropped at the lee of a coastal cape. Dynamically, the shoreward cross-isobath transport over <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> shelf is geostrophically enhanced by a quasi-barotropic negative (westward) along-isobath pressure gradient force {{as a result of the}} net rate of the momentum influx and by an intensified bottom frictional transport owing to the flow confluence near the head of <b>the</b> <b>widened</b> shelf. A negative pressure gradient also exists at the lee of the coastal cape over the inner shelf and locally amplifies shoreward motion. Induced by <b>the</b> respective <b>widened</b> shelf and <b>the</b> coastal promontory, the along-isobath variations of cross-isobath transport in the water column over the middle and inner shelves interactively characterize intensified upwelling in the NSCS...|$|R

5|$|The {{portion of}} the turnpike in the Philadelphia area had become a {{congested}} commuter road by the 1980s. In 1983, funding was approved to widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Valley Forge and Philadelphia interchanges. This planned project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor Dick Thornburgh and the turnpike commission members, and differences between the commissioners. The Pennsylvania Legislature approved the project in 1985; the road would be widened between the Norristown and Philadelphia interchanges. Construction on <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> began on March 10, 1986, and was completed on November 23, 1987 with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. <b>The</b> <b>widening</b> project cost $120 million. An interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was planned in the 1980s. In 1992, the turnpike commission decided not to build it because it would instead build a connector road to the depot between PA 114 and Old York Road that would parallel the turnpike.|$|E
