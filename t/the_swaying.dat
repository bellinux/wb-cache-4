40|$|AIMS: To evaluate, {{by means}} of {{electronic}} baropodometry (EB), the postural findings in patients affected by ocular torticollis. METHODS: Posturographic analysis (length of <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> path, sway area, and mean velocity) was made in 54 patients with IV palsy, Duane Syndrome, or rectus superior palsy (group A) and compared with a control group of 45 healthy subjects (group B). The test was performed with both eyes open, then both closed, then with the affected eye open, and finally with the healthy eye open. RESULTS: With both eyes open or closed, the length of <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> path, <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> area, and mean velocity were significantly increased in group A compared with group B (P< 0. 0001). When the open eye {{was the one with}} the muscular paresis, the length of <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> path was significantly increased as compared with the healthy eye (P< 0. 0001), and <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> area was increased too (P< 0. 029).

Balance assessment has commonly been subjective; however, advances in handheld mobile devices have provided objective balance measurement tools. Recently, <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> Balance Mobile Application, which utilizes tri-axial accelerometers to determine balance variations, was significantly correlated with the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) for young adults. Older adults have not been assessed. The assessment of balance has commonly been a subjective task; however, technological advances in handheld mobile devices have provided an objective way to measure balance via the use of tri-axial accelerometers. Recent literature has demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> Balance Mobile Application (SWAY), which utilizes tri-axial accelerometers to determine variations in balance, was significantly correlated with the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). Such literature demonstrates that SWAY can provide an objective balance score for young adults; however, special populations such as older adults need to be assessed. PURPOSE: To compare <b>the</b> objective <b>SWAY</b> Balance Mobile Application to the subjective BESS balance assessment of older adults. METHODS: Forty-three older adults (19 male, 24 female; aged 60. 14 ± 6. 72 years) completed <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> and <b>the</b> BESS balance assessments concurrently. A {{modified version of the}} BESS was used for testing, whereas the participant completed the balance stances on solid ground and did not repeat the stances on a foam mat. Participants simultaneously completed <b>the</b> <b>SWAY,</b> by holding a common mobile consumer electronic device mid-sternum and completing 5 different balance stances. The balance stances included a double leg stance, single leg stance (tested for dominant and non-dominant leg separately), and tandem stance (heel-to toe; tested with dominant foot behind the non-dominant and again with non-dominant foot behind the dominant). A Certified Athletic Trainer determined the BESS scores for each participant using only the double leg stance and the non-dominant variations of the remaining stances; however, all 5 stances were used to determine <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> score. A lower score on the BESS indicates better balance, whereas, a higher score on <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> indicates better balance. Correlation analyses were used to determine the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> and <b>the</b> BESS balance assessment techniques. RESULTS: <b>The</b> mean <b>SWAY</b> score was 64. 54 (± 16. 25) and the mean BESS score was 11. 00 (± 3. 96). There was a significant negative correlation between <b>the</b> <b>SWAY</b> scores and <b>the</b> BESS balance assessment scores (r = - 0. 640, p <. 01).

She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has {{a little bit of the}} edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in.

500|$|High {{winds are}} known to cause damage, {{depending}} upon the magnitude of their velocity and pressure differential. Wind pressures are positive on the windward side of a structure and negative on the leeward side. [...] Infrequent wind gusts can cause poorly designed suspension bridges to sway. When wind gusts are at a similar frequency to <b>the</b> <b>swaying</b> of the bridge, the bridge can be destroyed more easily, such as what occurred with the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940. Wind speeds as low as [...] can lead to power outages due to tree branches disrupting the flow of energy through power lines. While no species of tree is guaranteed {{to stand up to}} hurricane-force winds, those with shallow roots are more prone to uproot, and brittle trees such as eucalyptus, sea hibiscus, and avocado are more prone to damage. Hurricane-force winds cause substantial damage to mobile homes, and begin to structurally damage homes with foundations. Winds of this strength due to downsloped winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars. Once winds exceed , homes completely collapse, and significant damage is done to larger buildings. Total destruction to man-made structures occurs when winds reach [...] The Saffir–Simpson scale and Enhanced Fujita scale were designed to help estimate wind speed from the damage caused by high winds related to tropical cyclones and tornadoes, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this brief}} {{technical}} note was {{to focus on a}} widely used method for evaluating the statokinesigram: the confidence ellipse. We pointed out that several authors misinterpret the meaning of confidence ellipse, which is actually well defined in statistics. Most of the researchers use the parameters of the Time Domain (calculated by the Discrete Fourier Trasform) and those of the Areas Domain of <b>the</b> <b>sway.</b> <b>The</b> Area of the circle includes almost 95 % of <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> path, and it is called in a incorrectly: Confidence Circle Area. Ellipse Area includes also almost 95 % of all the points of <b>the</b> <b>sway,</b> incorrectly named Confidence Ellipse Area, and it can be associated to the stabilogram. In this case it is possible to assume some more informations such as: the mean direction of all <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> path and <b>the</b> ellipse shape. Considering Area it is possible to calculate also: the mean distance from the Centre of Gravity (CG), the mean distance on the antero-posterior axis, the mean distance on the medio-lateral axis. Anyway we illustrated some limitations when using confidence ellipse in evaluating statokinesigram. Finally we suggested substituting confidence ellipse with the standard ellipse.

The Tallahassee Democrat reported that [...] "at {{the height of the}} wind several hundred Tallahasseeans were seen rushing into their yard to gather pecans which were knocked down by <b>the</b> <b>swaying</b> trees". The storm destroyed vehicles throughout the region; replacement automobiles were sparse, as assembly plants were producing cars for the Army.

Initial fears of severe damage along the coast prompted rescue crews to push toward St. Marks; however, upon arrival a group of local residents convinced the crew that their assistance was unnecessary. Considerable crop and property damage was reported; total losses in the state were estimated at $675,000 USD ($ in today's terms). Seven injuries were reported, and five men drowned in the storm tide at a fishing net drying yard in Panacea, Florida. Initially, there were reports of 20 missing fishermen. 34 Cuban fishermen were also trapped off the coast near Carrabelle when 10 boats ran aground and were damaged after the storm surge subsided. The fishermen's supply of food was destroyed by salt water, but they were rescued by the Coast Guard cutter Nemesis without any injuries.

It stood in much deeper water {{than the other}} two (185 feet, compared to 80 feet for Tower 2), and it was held that the simple cylindrical leg design would not be sturdy enough given the length of the legs. Therefore, three sets of cross braces were added between the legs, attached with pin joints. These made it impossible to tow the platform on the level; instead, the structure was laid on its side for transport and then tipped upright at the site. These braces proved to be frail and the joints prone to loosening: two braces broke loose during transport, and a third was lost when the tower was being placed on the bottom. Divers were brought in several times to inspect the structure and to perform repairs, and an additional set of crossbraces was installed immediately below the platform, above the waterline, in 1960.
