5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who do not give up hope even {{at the edge of the}} grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who are dedicated to public service.

500|$|Donnell's {{goal was}} that the Monadnock would [...] "not only look as it {{originally}} did, it [...] also live as it used to", and he sought tenants for the street-level shops that were similar to their 19th-century occupants. Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street. Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage. Shops, all individually owned, were selected to fit the architectural character of the building. A florist, for example, was chosen that evoked a turn-of-the-century atmosphere, {{as well as a}} barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor. A tobacconist with oak furnishings, a pen shop with glass cases, a shoe-shine stand, and other service establishments represented, in Donnell's words, [...] "the kind of small-scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces {{at the turn of the}} century, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who bring vitality and life to a building because they have a stake in it." ...|$|E

[...] The Times review stated that [...] "All the latest news items, rumours and sightings concerning the one-time wonder boy and the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer are logged daily by <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who appreciate smart, sophisticated dialogue and plotting." [...] Whedonesque won SyFy Portal's Genre Award for Best Web Site of 2006, and was nominated for same award in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Entertainment Weekly selected Whedonesque as one of the 100 Greatest Websites on December 20, 2007. In May 2008, EW selected Whedonesque as eighth on their list of 25 Essential Fansites, calling it [...] "a reservoir of material about anyone who's starred in (or, it would seem, breathed near) his nerd-magnet projects: Buffy, Angel, and Firefly/Serenity." ...|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> we are".|$|E

500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita". During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried {{with her a}} stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide [...] "diversity and choice" [...] to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 {{and that it would be}} for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that [...] "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, , they're not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Michael Carnahan was {{inspired}} to write the script when, while channel surfing {{trying to find a}} USC Trojans football game, he saw a news report about a Humvee that had flipped into an Iraqi river, drowning about five U.S. soldiers. Carnahan considered it an awful way to die, and [...] "couldn’t get past it fast enough", considering he was too indifferent, [...] "talking so much and not doing a damn thing", and [...] "the same hypocrite that I so can’t stand in our country, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that will flip right past the news to get to Access Hollywood". He first considered turning it into a stage play, but the military scenes, in particular the helicopter ones, made him turn it into a film screenplay. The character of Todd Hayes {{was inspired}} by Carnahan himself during college.|$|E
2500|$|Masters {{attempted}} to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. [...] Masters {{had refused to}} make films with synchronous sound until 1983—long after most other gay pornographic studios had not only begun using dialogue synched to the actor's lip movements but also had moved from film to video. Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time. [...] Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> we use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background—they can't {{do any of these}} things, and it's just going to be absurd to make them say things when they aren't going to say them well." ...|$|E
2500|$|After her {{start in}} Baltimore, Waters toured {{on the black}} {{vaudeville}} circuit. As she described it later, [...] "I used to work from nine until unconscious." [...] Despite her early success, she fell on hard times and joined a carnival, traveling in freight cars along the carnival circuit and eventually reaching Chicago. Waters enjoyed her time with the carnival and recalled, [...] "the roustabouts and the concessionaires were <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> I'd grown up with, rough, tough, full of larceny towards strangers, but sentimental and loyal to their friends and co-workers." [...] She {{did not last long}} with them, though, and soon headed south to Atlanta, where she worked in the same club with Bessie Smith. Smith demanded that Waters not compete in singing blues opposite her. Waters conceded and sang ballads and popular songs. Around 1919, Waters moved to Harlem and there became a celebrity performer in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s.|$|E

2500|$|To {{shape the}} science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired {{scientific}} advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, was hired to advise {{the cast and crew}} after the director had seen Cox on the science TV series Horizon. Cox gave regular lectures to the film's cast members about solar physics, and also advised the filmmakers to scale down the nuclear device in the film from the mass of the Moon to the size of Manhattan. In the film's backstory, a Q-ball enters and is caught in the Earth's Sun, and begins to eat it away. According to Cox, the Sun would not be dense enough in real life to stop a Q-ball, but filmmakers took creative licence in writing the backstory. Cox noted in the DVD commentary that several inaccuracies were permitted to allow for plot. He also dismissed criticisms of the film by scientists: [...] "Sunshine is not a documentary. It's trying to just, in an hour and forty minutes, get across a feeling of what it's like – not only to be a scientist, because obviously there's much more in it than that. So, I found it interesting to watch <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that get upset because the gravity is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
