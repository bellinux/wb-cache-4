5|$|Mr. Nobody is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The film tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three critical junctions in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those critical junctions are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.|$|E

25|$|Fleming was {{an elegant}} left handed batsman and played shots such as <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> off the pads, {{straight}} drive, cover drive and cut shots. He {{was also a}} clever captain and his field placings for many batsmen like Damien Martyn at point and aggressive captaincy made the opposition struggle for their runs. He was also a prolific slip catcher and fielded well in close-in positions.|$|E
25|$|A flick shot is a straight-batted shot {{played on}} the leg side by {{flicking}} a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs. The shot is playing with the bat coming through straight as for the on drive, but the bat face is angled towards the leg side. It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> can also be played by lofting the ball over the infield.|$|E

50|$|Eventually {{the coin}} either drops {{into one of}} the winning slots or it falls down between the slots. The {{positioning}} of the gates usually makes the latter possibility more likely. In the former case, the player gets a prize of a couple of coins, and in the latter case the player loses <b>the</b> <b>flicked</b> coin. <b>The</b> size of the prize for each winning slot is printed next to the winning slot, varying from two times the value of <b>the</b> <b>flicked</b> coin to ten or even one hundred times <b>the</b> <b>flicked</b> coin. <b>The</b> most valuable winning slots {{are in the middle of}} the playing area, and in modern machines themost valuable slot has a variable payoff so that the best payoff may not be even in principle achievable with every flick.|$|R

25|$|Younis is {{regarded}} as one of the best players of spin bowling in the world, being particularly strong on the leg side. His favourite and trademark shot is <b>the</b> <b>flick,</b> but it has also been his shortcoming, with him being particularly prone to falling lbw during the early stages of his innings. He is also prone to getting down on one knee and driving extravagantly. But this flamboyance is coupled with grit. One of his main weaknesses is playing away from the body, he also has a tendency to leave straight balls, a trait that has been exploited by bowlers in the past, particularly by the Australian attack. Along with Mohammad Yousuf and the now retired Inzamam-ul-Haq, he formed a formidable middle order batting line up for Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|While at war Mathews' {{reputation}} as a fledgling leader had spread through his home state. In a post-war state that was dominated by the Republican party, Mathews, a Democrat, {{was elected to the}} West Virginia Senate in 1865 but was not allowed to serve due to the restriction that prohibited former Confederates from holding public office. Though the legislative minority, the generally ex-Confederate led Democrats grew in popularity in the half-decade following the war. In 1871, <b>the</b> <b>Flick</b> Amendment was ratified to the West Virginia State Constitution, returning state rights to former Confederates and allowing the Democratic party to regain control of the legislature. Mathews was sent as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1872 to overhaul the 1863 Republican-drafted state constitution. The following year he was elected 7th Attorney General of the state under Governor John J. Jacob and served ably one term in which his popularity within his party rose.|$|E
25|$|These arduous {{methods of}} {{preparation}} were {{in keeping with}} the general values espoused at the École. But one professor from that institution was to have a more particular and wide ranging impact on Seurat’s imagination, which bore directly discernable effects in the Bathers. CharlesBlanc had been a professor and director at the École and had arranged for copies of Quattrocento fresco paintings from Arezzo to be displayed in the École chapel. The huge, stately and dignified figures in these frescos, and the regularity of their spacing has obvious echoes in the Bathers. Among these fresco painters was PierodellaFrancesca, whose Resurrection depicts a sleeping guard at the bottom-left sharing a number of features with the seated man in Bathers at Asnières. The curvature of slumping back and bent legs is clearly matched in both figures, and indeed the posture also appears in the Young Male Nude Seated beside the Sea of Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, a painting with which any student at the École would have been familiar. The sculpted contours of Piero’s soldier’s cape find an echo in the rugged contours of the trousers in Seurat’s painting, and <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> {{at the back of the}} guard’s hat becomes a rhythmic motif showing up with hats, hair and bootstraps alike in Bathers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe drag flick {{technique}} in field hockey {{is an important}} ‘weapon’ for scoring. Unfortunately, especially younger sportsmen often drop out when training <b>the</b> drag <b>flick.</b> A training tool was developed to improve <b>the</b> drag <b>flick</b> technique, to decrease the load on the body during <b>the</b> drag <b>flick,</b> and to increase the fun factor. A survey showed that trainers and hockey players were positive about the tool {{on all of the}} three aspects. Video analysis showed that training <b>the</b> drag <b>flick</b> with <b>the</b> tool reduced the load on the lower back. There was no difference in ground reaction force...|$|R
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film {{one and a}} half stars out of four, saying that [...] "after all the Internet hype about those motherfuckin' snakes on that motherfuckin' plane, <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> itself is a murky stew of shock effects {{repeated}} so often that the suspense quickly droops along with your eyelids." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker claimed that the film [...] "... may mark a new participatory style in marketing, but it still gulls an allegedly knowing audience with the pseudo-morality of yesteryear." ...|$|E
500|$|Kohli is a {{naturally}} aggressive batsman with strong technical skills. He usually bats in the middle-order, but, on many occasions, {{has opened the}} innings as well. He bats with a slightly open-chested stance and a strong bottom-hand grip, and {{is said to have}} quick footwork. He is known for his wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings and batting under pressure. He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region. He has said that the cover drive is his favourite shot, while also saying that <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> shot comes naturally to him. He does not play the sweep shot often, being called [...] "not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball". His teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics. Kohli is also known to be a [...] "sharp" [...] fielder.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} in June 1988 that Jones had signed a new contract to appear as Jane for another twelve months. But Jane and Mike's relationship would not last as writers decided to pair her with another established character, Des Clarke (Paul Keane). Their relationship is formed when Des decides to help Mike set up a photography dark room for a birthday gift. Jane offers to help but nearly electrocutes herself but Des manages to rescue her. Jane believes Des has saved her life and they develop a connection. Jones told TV Week's Lawrie Masterson that [...] "it builds towards a full on affair. Jane becomes virtually a stand-in mother for little Jamie (Des' son) and all those maternal instincts that girls have start to emerge. This results in the final break-down of her relationship with Mike, Jones added [...] "Mike gets <b>the</b> <b>flick</b> basically." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dancehall Queen" [...] was {{directed}} by Diplo, Red Foxx and Pomp It premiered on 29 November 2010 via Robyn's official YouTube account. Ryan Staake of Pomp referred the video to as a [...] "really weird VHS/karaoke video". The video resembles a faded karaoke tape with occasional sing-along lyrics {{on the bottom of}} the screen. Robyn does not appear in the video. Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork said that the video is [...] "complete with awkward/sexy dancing and footage of bustling city life". Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator wrote a mixed review of the clip, stating, [...] "We’re guessing Robyn didn’t want the “hassle” of appearing, so instead we’re treated to—seemingly—random grainy footage of the streets of Japan and gyrating women as the words of the chorus appear karaoke-style on the screen. We can say one good thing about <b>the</b> <b>flick,</b> if you were confused about the song’s lyrics, they’re fairly easy to read." ...|$|E
500|$|Kiep {{served as}} federal {{treasurer}} of the CDU from 1971 to 1992. During his tenure, the party was involved in several financial scandals. Shortly after taking over, Kiep brought in economist Uwe Lüthje as general agent and public accountant Horst Weyrauch as a financial consultant. Together, the three started an elaborate system aimed at accumulating funding for the party. The Staatsbürgerliche Vereinigung 1954 e.V. (...) was used by major companies to donate money to the CDU anonymously, while the donations were fully tax deductible due to the Vereinigung being considered non-profit. Just in the election year 1972, 30 million Deutsche Mark {{are said to have}} been accumulated in this fashion. Over the course of its existence, the Vereinigung gave 214 million Deutsche Marks to political parties between 1969 and 1980. The procedure was made public during the uncovering of <b>the</b> <b>Flick</b> affair in the early 1980s. Kiep was ultimately accused of having amassed 18.5 million Deutsche Marks in illegal donations for the CDU, evading nine million Deutsche Marks in taxes. For his role, he was sentenced to a payment of 675,000 Deutsche Marks in 1991, but the verdict was revoked a year later by the Federal Court of Justice.|$|E

50|$|The Hollow-Face {{illusion}} {{has been}} used to study the dissociation between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action (see Two-streams hypothesis). In this experiment, people used their finger to make a quick flicking movement at a small target attached to the inside surface of the hollow - but apparently normal - face, or on the surface of a normal protruding face. The idea was that <b>the</b> fast <b>flicking</b> (rather like flicking a small insect off the face) would engage the vision-for-action networks in the dorsal stream - and thus would be directed to the actual rather than the perceived position of the target. The results were clear. Despite the presence of a robust illusion in which people perceived the hollow face {{as if it were a}} normal protruding face, <b>the</b> <b>flicking</b> movements they made were accurately directed to the real, not the illusory location of the target. This result suggests that the bottom-up cues that drive <b>the</b> <b>flicking</b> response are distinct from the top-down cues that drive the Hollow-Face illusion.|$|R
