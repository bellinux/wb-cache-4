It is recommended that estimation of TOPE be made by dosing pairs of rats across a range of doses and making regular observations of gait and arousal. However {{it is well known that}} TOPE may vary with end points or exposure conditions. In order to derive quantitative safety measures such as the benchmark doses (BMD), dose-time-response modeling must be done first and a model-based estimate is then implied. In many cases, the overall BMD corresponds to a TOPE estimate. In such cases a substantial variation in the TOPE estimate in turn may result in substantial variation in BMD estimate. Therefore a reliable statistical estimate of TOPE is crucial to the correct determination of BMD. We therefore performed simulation studies to assess the impact of the experiment-based TOPE on the statistical estimation of the true TOPE on the basis of a fitted dose-time-response model. The simulation allows for the determination of the optimal <b>timing</b> <b>range</b> for the 2 nd testing.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of fuel property effects in internal combustion engines is required to enable fuel diversification as well as applications to advanced engines being developed for operation {{with a variety of}} combustion modes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of fuel ignitability and volatility over a wide range on premixed low-temperature combustion (LTC) modes in diesel engines. Twenty three fuels were prepared from commercial gasoline, kerosene, and diesel as baseline fuels and with the addition of additives, to generate a cetane number (CN) range from 11 to 75. Experiments with a single cylinder diesel engine operated in moderately-advanced-injection LTC modes were conducted to evaluate these fuels. The combustion phasing is demonstrated to be a good indicator to estimate the in-cylinder peak pressure, exhaust gas emissions, and thermal efficiency in the LTC mode. Fuel ignitability affects the combustion phasing by changing the ignition delay. The predicted cetane number (PCN) based on fuel molecular structure analysis can be fitted to the ignition delays with a higher coefficient of determination than CN, suggesting a good potential as a fuel ignitability measure over a wide range. The stable operating load range in the smokeless LTC mode depends more on the actual ignition delay or PCN rather than CN. With fixed injection timing and intake oxygen concentration, O_[2 in], only when PCN < 40, the load range can be expanded significantly to higher loads. With holding the combustion phasing at TDC and varying O_[2 in], the NOx and smoke emissions become limitations of the load expansion for some fuels. The effects of fuel volatility on the characteristics of LTC are small compared to ignitability. Finally, the operational injection <b>timing</b> <b>range</b> and robustness of the LTC to fuel ignitability are examined, showing that the advantageous ignitability range becomes narrower, with fuel ignitability decreasing...|$|E

C. engines operating on natural gas, the Swiss limit for exhaust gas emissions, with 80 mg/mN 3 (5 % O 2), is the most severe in force on an international level. On the other hand, the only technology able to meet this requirement, {{with the use of a}} stoechiometric mixture and a three way catalyst, allows a relatively low global engine efficiency and is characterised by a limited reliability of the exhaust gas treatment system. In this context, the Laboratory of Industrial Energy Systems of the EPFL has undertaken, on the basis of a converted diesel engine for natural gas operation, to develop new technologies (mixture, ignition, [...] .) and to evaluate their potential to reduce exhaust gas emission, particilarly NOx, and reliability. The objective of the first part of this project is to study the behaviour of a naturally aspirated version of the engine “Liebherr G 926 ”, fuelled with a stoechiometric mixture. The main engine characteristics and perfomances have been used to reduce noxious emissions. The main results obtained are: A variation of the spark timing at wide open throttle has allowed to determine the best operating condition with a mixture of l= 1. 001. The maximal mechanical power output of 106. 3 ± 0. 5 kW at 1502 ± 5 rpm and the maximal global efficiency of 35. 9 + 1, 7 /- 0. 6 % have been achieved at a spark timing of 20 °CA BTDC. The lowest cycle to cycle variability, with a coefficitent of variability of the mean effective pressure smaller than 1. 5 %, is reached at the same spark timing (Figure 5. 11). No occurrence of knock has been noticed on the spark <b>timing</b> <b>range</b> between 5 and 30 °CA BTDC. An increase of the spark gap from 0. 2 up to 1. 2 mm reduced the combustion cycle by cycle variability (Figure 5. 21) without modifying the engine performances and emissions (Figures 5. 15 and 5. 17), at full as well as at half load. A increase, respectively a decrease of two units of the spark thermal index from a basis value of 5 has no significant influence on engine performances and emission (Figures 5. 23 to 5. 26). Similarly, an increase of the central electrode length from 1 up to 3 mm has no detectable effect on the engine behaviour (Figures 5. 23 5 o 5. 26).

40|$|BACKGROUND: n 1966, the Population Council (a non-profit, non-government {{organisation}} {{which aims}} to foster reproductive health around the world) sponsored demonstration projects (known as the 'International Postpartum Program') on postpartum family planning, focussing primarily on developing countries and including 25 hospitals in 14 countries (Zatuchni 1970). These projects {{were based on the}} assumptions that women are receptive to family planning education in the postpartum period, and that they will not return to health centres for contraception once they have been discharged from hospital. The demonstration projects were declared a success given their ability to reach large numbers of women, and they were expanded to include hospitals in 21 countries (Winikoff et al 1991). Randomised controlled trials were not used to assess the effectiveness of the program. The provision of education on contraceptive use to postpartum mothers has come to be considered a standard component of postnatal care, with up to 84 % of women noting that a discussion on contraception took place with a midwife on the postnatal floor (Glasier et al 1996). Although education frequently is provided as an integral component of discharge planning, many women experience this as a perfunctory discussion included as part of a checklist of topics (Glasier et al 1996). Midwifery and obstetric texts routinely refer to the provision of such education as a responsibility in the provision of postpartum care; however, the effectiveness of this intervention is seldom questioned (Keith et al 1980; Semeraro 1996). Questions have been raised about the assumptions that are the basis for such programs, e. g. that postpartum women are motivated to use contraception and that they will not return to a health centre for family planning advice (Winikoff et al 1991). In addition surveys conducted postpartum indicate that women may wish to discuss contraception antenatally and post hospital discharge, preferably in the context of general education about maternal and child health (Ozvaris 1997). OBJECTIVES: Postpartum education on contraceptive use is a routine component of discharge planning in many different countries {{with a wide variety of}} health care systems. This education is based on assumptions concerning women's receptivity to contraceptive education during the postpartum period and their presumed lack of access to such education after that time. The objective of this review is to assess the effects of education about contraceptive use to postpartum mothers. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psychlit, Popline, citations indexes and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted subject experts to locate additional research, in addition to the Group's Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. Date of the most recent search: March 2001. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials using random or quasi-random methods of allocation which evaluated the effectiveness of postpartum education about contraceptive use. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers abstracted data on trial characteristics and results. MAIN RESULTS: No new trials were identified since this review was updated in 1999. Three trials were identified with 5438 women. These trials were conducted in Lebanon, Peru and Nepal. None of the trials examined all major prespecified endpoints. Postpartum education about contraceptive use influenced short-term use assessed between 40 days and three months post-partum. Women in the intervention groups were less likely to be non-users than women in the comparison groups (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0. 47, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 0. 39 to 0. 58). This benefit was not apparent following analysis of data from better quality studies (OR = 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 41 to 1. 13). An apparent benefit on contraceptive use at six months post-partum (OR = 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 37 to 0. 74) was not apparent following sensitivity analyses (OR = 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 33 to 1. 06). Data are inadequate to assess the impact on cessation of breast feeding and non-attendance at family planning clinics. Unplanned pregnancies, knowledge about contraception and satisfaction with care were not assessed in any trial. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of postpartum education about contraceptive use has not yet been established in randomised controlled trials. Such education may be effective in increasing the short-term use of contraception. However, there are only limited data examining a more-important longer-term effect on the prevention of unplanned pregnancies. Research needs to be undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the minimalist education provided in more developed countries and the variety of programs provided in less developed regions. Such research should examine the content, <b>timing,</b> <b>range</b> and organisation of postpartum education on contraceptive use including lactational amenorrhea, as well as its impact on breast feeding rates.

Combined results from 2012 and 2013 trials indicated that application timing in the spring was not critical. Oxamyl application reduced root P. penetrans population densities in all six trials.

Phytotoxicity to newly planted raspberry was never observed in any of the trials. A nonbearing application of oxamyl is an important addition to current control methods used to manage P. penetrans in raspberry in Washington...|$|R
40|$|We are {{presenting}} the design, construction and {{tests of the}} timing system for the Laser Altimeter technology demonstrator. Altimeter Timing System (ATS) is a universal timing system for laser ranging in ground-ground, air-ground and ground-satellite experiments. It is dedicated to measure precise time interval with sub-nanosecond resolution. The device for advanced range gating is included. The unit is interfaced to a host personal computer via a serial data link for control, two-way data transfer and diagnostics. The entire ATS has been designed and constructed {{on the basis of}} the Portable Calibration Standard (PCS) for satellite laser ranging, which has been developed in our labs within the last ten years. To reduce the complexity, costs, weight and power, considering the modest timing resolution requirements, the sub-nanoseconds instead of picoseconds resolution of the time intervals, the timing part of the original device has been replaced by the Mini Counter. The overall design philosophy, the operational control software, the epoch <b>timing,</b> the <b>range</b> gate generation have been preserved along with the concept of the host computer software package for data acquisition, control and data analysis including the communication protocol, data and command formats etc. The use of well-tested concept of both the HW and SW enabled to shorten the design, construction and testing phase of the final device down to several weeks. The ATS consists of the Mini Counter module, the epoch <b>timing</b> and <b>range</b> gate generator module, the control processing unit, the input/output circuits and of the power supplies. The entire control logic hardware including the epoch <b>timing</b> and <b>range</b> gate generator and the input/output board logic is based on the FPGA (ispGAL) programmable logical arrays. There is a significant array capacity still available for future functional extensions and device upgrades, the arrays are field programmable. This fact ensures the maximum device flexibility and upgradability. The main parameters are: resolution 0. 25 ns, linearity and stability better than 0. 1 ns and 0. 1 ns per K and per hour resp. The laser fire epoch resolution is 100 ns, the range gate is programmable in 40 ns steps. The device is small (2 kg), low power, it is capable to operate 3 hours on eight pieces of AA batteries...|$|R
