In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, poverty forced Lambert <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> on {{exhibition}} {{to raise}} money. In , {{he took up}} residence in London, charging spectators to enter his apartments to meet him. Visitors were impressed by his intelligence and personality, and visiting him became highly fashionable. After some months on public display, Lambert grew tired of exhibiting himself, and in , he returned, wealthy, to Leicester, where he bred sporting dogs and regularly attended sporting events. Between 1806 and 1809, he made a further series of short fundraising tours.|$|E
5|$|Mason, {{along with}} a group of other Advanced Liberals {{supporting}} John Morley, the gladstonian, was one of the founding members of the Reform Club in Manchester, a political club founded in 1867 for Liberals and their supporters. Despite retiring from local politics because of conflict with the Liberals, by 1878 he was back in favour and Liberal councillors were encouraging Mason to stand for parliamentary election. Although he was a popular candidate, he was initially reluctant <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> forward. However, he stood for Parliament in the 1880 General Elections. His campaign in March and April 1880 involved vitriolic attacks on the local Conservative Party and on 3April 1880 he was elected MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, beating his opponent, John Ross Coulthart, by 2,966 votes to 2,586.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to Mr. Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest that Mr. Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> in the lead. Mr. Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.|$|E
5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs, and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|Despite making several basic {{errors in}} calculating {{ingredient}} quantities and orders, particularly considering his bank manager background, Kevin survived mostly {{because he was}} the only person who tried to organise and motivate the team for most of the task. While Sir Alan felt that Simon had mainly shown proficiency at physical tasks and thus was an unconvincing possibility to win the competition, along with never giving any solutions to Ian's decisions that he complained about, he ultimately spared him because of his loyalty and dedication.

His PhD thesis was on a steel truss arch design for the Henry Hudson Bridge.

He accepted a teaching position at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho (1910–1914) but longed to return to New York.|$|E

25|$|Concerned at {{the growing}} threat, the {{authorities}} in Rome appointed Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius as governor of Hispania Ulterior. Metellus, basing himself at Metellinum (modern Medellin), made several thrusts into the interior, but was thwarted by Sertorius who used guerrilla tactics so effectively that after two years Metellus was exhausted. Meanwhile Sertorius' subordinate, Lucius Hirtuleius, was able to defeat Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 77 BC he was joined by Perpenna who brought the remnant of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus from Sardinia. However Perpenna had only reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> under Sertorius' command; when his men had heard that Pompey {{had been sent to}} Iberia they had demanded that Perpenna join up with Sertorius.|$|E
25|$|Bertie {{was again}} {{returned}} for Westbury in the 1690 election without a contest. A Tory {{like the rest}} of his family, his role in this Parliament was overshadowed by his kinsmen, including his more active nephew and namesake, Peregrine Bertie. The disaffection of Danby, now Marquess of Carmarthen, with the other Tory peers seems to have drawn the Berties, to some extent, into opposition to the Court during this time. By 1694, however, Peregrine was writing to Lindsey to suggest that Charles might take the occasion of a by-election at Stamford <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> in better standing with the Court. In 1693, he gave up his customs surveyorship and was replaced by John Dove.|$|E
25|$|Born in Isabel in Edgar County {{in eastern}} Illinois, Hunt visited Wyoming {{for the first}} time as a semi-professional {{baseball}} player. He graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University and then worked as a railroad switchman <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> through dental school at Saint Louis University. After graduating in 1917, he moved to Lander, Wyoming, and established a practice. He joined the United States Army Dental Corps when the United States entered World War I, and served as a lieutenant from 1917 to 1919. After postgraduate study at Northwestern University in 1920, Hunt resumed his practice in Lander. He was president of the Wyoming State Dental Society and began his career in government when appointed as president of the Wyoming State Board of Dental Examiners, serving from 1924 to 1928.|$|E

25|$|To {{compose the}} music for Broadchurch, Ólafur read the show's scripts <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> in the right mood. He also {{researched}} sounds which might be heard in Dorset {{as a means of}} inspiration. As with most of his music, he then improvised at the piano. He composed several themes, some for the series as a whole and some for specific characters. He then shared them with Chibnall, and together they picked out the themes they liked best. Using synthesizers or electronic sound generators, Ólafur also composed sounds to be heard when action occurred in certain spaces, such as the cliffs. Once he saw the completed footage for the first episode, he rearranged some themes to fit the imagery, and composed several new themes as well. Because there was so little time between his being hired and the air date, Ólafur composed very quickly and spent extraordinarily long days at work. He had just four months to generate about 30 minutes of sound and music for each episode, spending one-and-a-half to two weeks on each episode. Despite the time crunch, Ólafur credited Chibnall's relaxed attitude as the key to the music's success.|$|E
25|$|Camilo Villegas had {{his best}} major {{finish with a}} tie for fourth, which was his second top 10 finish at the 2008 majors. He backed up his 67 earlier {{in the third round}} with a two-under 68 to finish four strokes behind Harrington. J. B. Holmes, who was one shot back to start the final round, triple bogeyed the first hole en route to an 11-over-par 81. Henrik Stenson had his second {{straight}} top 5 at the majors despite shooting a two-over 72 to fall into a tie with Villegas. Steve Flesch found the cup from the fairway on the 18th to become the first on the day to birdie the hole. He finished by himself in sixth place and recorded his second top 10 finish at the majors in 2008. Phil Mickelson birdied three of his first four holes <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> in contention, but did not birdie another hole and fell into a tie for seventh with Andrés Romero. Romero was unable to back up the 65 he shot in the third round and never mustered up a challenge for the leaders.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the match}} got on, Jones and Harmison {{putting on the}} {{pressure}} and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after {{he had failed to}} score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones served up a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 {{at the end of the}} tenth over. However, that was as good as it got for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but it mattered little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then served up a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff was very good, however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.|$|E
