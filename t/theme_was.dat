5|$|Bear McCreary {{was hired}} to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> based on his viewing of {{production}} designs for the opening title sequence.

5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> used throughout Zombie's remake, the <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

5|$|After the Hollywood <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> decided on, {{the design}} team {{drew up a}} map and {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally designed for the ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variation}} on the <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} success of the Troilus, the love story was popular as a free {{standing}} tale to be retold by English-language writers throughout the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century.

For many authors, true Troilus, false Cresseid and pandering Pandarus became ideal types eventually {{to be referred to}} together as such in Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E
