50|$|Moreover, {{the banking}} system in Kosovo seems very sound. For {{the banking system}} as a whole, the <b>Tier</b> <b>One</b> <b>Capital</b> Ratio as of January 2012 was 17.5%, double the ratio {{required}} in the EU; the proportion of non-performing loans was 5.9%, well below the regional average; and the credit to deposit ratio was only just above 80%. The assets of the banking system have increased from 5% of GDP in 2000 to 60% of GDP as of January 2012. Since the housing stock in Kosovo is generally good by South-East European standards, this suggests that (if the legal system's ability to enforce claims on collateral and resolve property issues is trusted), credit to Kosovars could be safely expanded.|$|E

Its lending profile is less oriented toward consumer or mortgage lending than other leading banks in Argentina; one third of its outstanding credit is to the public sector and 80% of the remainder is allocated to commercial loans.|$|E

5000|$|Tier 1 capital, {{the more}} {{important}} of the two, consists largely of shareholders' equity and disclosed reserves. This is the amount paid up to originally purchase the stock (or shares) of the Bank (not the amount those shares are currently trading for on the stock exchange), retained profits subtracting accumulated losses, and other qualifiable Tier 1 capital securities (see below). In simple terms, if the original stockholders contributed $100 to buy their stock and the Bank has made $10 in retained earnings each year since, paid out no dividends, had no other forms of capital and made no losses, after 10 years the Bank's <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> <b>capital</b> would be $200.

40|$|The Basel III Leverage Ratio, as {{originally}} agreed upon in December 2010, has recently undergone revisions and updates – both {{in relation to}} those proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – as well as proposals introduced in the United States. Whilst recent proposals have been introduced by the Basel Committee to improve, particularly, the denominator component of the Leverage Ratio, new requirements have been introduced in the U. S to upgrade and increase these ratios, and it is those updates which relate to the Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio that have primarily generated a lot of interests. This is attributed not only to concerns that many subsidiaries of US Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) will find it cumbersome to meet such requirements, but also to potential or possible increases in regulatory capital arbitrage: a phenomenon which plagued {{the era of the}} original 1988 Basel Capital Accord and which also partially provided impetus for the introduction of Basel II. This paper is aimed at providing an analysis of the recent updates which have taken place in respect of the Basel III Leverage Ratio and the Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio – both in respect of recent amendments introduced by the Basel Committee and proposals introduced in the United States. It will also consider the consequences – as well as the impact - which the U. S Leverage ratios could have on Basel III. There are ongoing debates in relation to revision by the Basel Committee, as well as the most recent U. S proposals to update Basel III Leverage ratios and whilst these revisions have been welcomed to a large extent, in view of the need to address <b>Tier</b> <b>One</b> <b>capital</b> requirements and exposure criteria, there is every likelihood, indication, as well as tendency that many global systemically important banks (GSIBS), and particularly their subsidiaries, will resort to capital arbitrage. What {{is likely to be the}} impact of the recent proposals in the U. S. ? The recent U. S proposals are certainly very encouraging and should also serve as impetus for other jurisdictions to adopt a pro-active approach – particularly where existing ratios or standards appear to be inadequate. This paper also adopts the approach of evaluating the causes and consequences of the most recent updates by the Basel Committee, as well as those revisions which have taken place in the U. S, by attempting to balance the merits of the respective legislative updates and proposals. The value of adopting leverage ratios as a supplementary regulatory tool will also be illustrated by way of reference to the impact of the recent legislative changes on risk taking activities, as well as the need to also supplement capital adequacy requirements with the Basel Leverage ratios and the Basel liquidity standard...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOver {{recent years}} a few {{automobile}} manufacturers, that ca be OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer, have migrated or expanded their activities to non-traditional regions of Brazil seeking gains in productivity.

The dependency of <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> suppliers in transporting parts and components from distant places may result in unfavorable conditions due to production and logistics costs, which lead to non-optimized levels of quality and generally poor business results. This paper proposes a model for development of the supply chain {{in order to increase}} the competitiveness of potential local suppliers of <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> and OEM companies (tier 2 + suppliers). The model, applied to the automotive sector, encompasses the identification of demand, analysis of availability, identification of technological partners, and development of business plans.
