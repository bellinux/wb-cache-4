5|$|Accounts vary as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of casualties, but {{the most}} {{reliable}} evidence suggests that Jordan lost four killed, ten to twelve wounded, and 355 captured—about 100 escaped.

5|$|After the war, {{a bronze}} {{memorial}} plaque, inscribed {{with the name}} of the deceased alongside Britannia and a lion, and a scroll, sent to the next of kin of those had died {{in the service of the}} British Empire. Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately after the end of the war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E

5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E

5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} is equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average {{time it takes to}} execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency {{increase the amount of}} power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
