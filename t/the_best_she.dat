5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram {{said in an}} interview that her role was on par with his, and she easily stole the show on most occasions. Of her character in the film, Saran said that it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> has done so far. Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only high points of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy that takes a look at the serious nature of relationships between servants and employers. It was selected for the Toronto International Film Festival, which Saran attended.|$|E
25|$|It {{was noted}} {{as a very}} {{controversial}} incident due to the carer, Emma Bulbrooke, telling Marion's daughter {{to go to her}} mother's house and ‘do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could’ because the Southern Health office was closing at five o’clock.|$|E
25|$|Richmond {{had been}} made the capital since it was {{believed}} to be less exposed to attack than Williamsburg, but in January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, Benedict Arnold, sailed up the James River and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to Charlottesville. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under Lord Cornwallis entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington's army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state, and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel Banastre Tarleton raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to Staunton. There is a story that Henry fled with other prominent leaders, and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville. But on learning Henry was with the group, she decided it must be all right, and offered them <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> had.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to its}} release, {{the film}} was test {{screened}} with the public. These were described as [...] "through the roof," [...] and Glotzer said they were some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> had seen. It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King's name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a [...] "more prestigious audience" [...] who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for pulp fiction works like The Shining and Cujo.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jonathan Dakss Stone explained the album cover's concept, stating [...] "I wanted the flag to truly represent people of all colors. I wanted the color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. I wanted the color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|E
500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E

500|$|As part of {{the annual}} Guild Day {{procession}} of the inauguration of the new mayor of Norwich it was tradition for the head boy to deliver a short speech in Latin from the school porch [...] "commending justice and obedyence" [...] to the mayor and corporation. Afterwards the orator would attend the guild dinner, historically riding in the procession on a white horse, but in later years taken in the mayor's carriage. When Elizabeth I visited Norwich on a separate occasion in 1578 the master at the time, Stephen Limbert, {{is said to have}} delivered an oration, which [...] "so pleased Her Majesty that she said it had been <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> had heard, and gave him her hand to kiss, and afterwards sent back to enquire his name." [...] The encounter has been said to characterise the public image of Elizabeth I as a monarch who indulged her subjects with goodwill and has been used for the interpretation of the character of Theseus in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Chopra {{made her}} screen {{debut in the}} romantic comedy Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, in a {{supporting}} role with Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma. The film describes how three girls who are tricked by a con artist take revenge on him by plotting the same trick for him. Chopra played the Delhi-based [...] "rich and spoiled brat" [...] Dimple Chadda, who is betrayed by the film's central character. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was moderately successful at the box office. Chopra's performance was highly praised by film critics. Komal Nahta said, [...] "Of the three other girls, Parineeti Chopra is undoubtedly <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> <b>She</b> has the best role, the best lines and hers is the best performance among the three." [...] Priyanka Roy of The Telegraph described Chopra as [...] "natural" [...] and wrote [...] "Among the ladies, debutante Parineeti almost steals the show from Anushka." [...] The film earned her several awards, including the Filmfare Award, the Screen Award, the Producers Guild Film Award and the IIFA Award for Best Debut. Chopra also received nominations in the supporting actress category, including Filmfare, and won the Producers Guild and IIFA Awards in the same category.|$|E
500|$|Ethan Sack from New York Daily News {{said that}} [...] "it's a tossup over who looks better in tights and high-heels, the 53-year-old Material Girl or the bevy of shirtless male dancers who gyrate around her." [...] Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly praised the video {{saying that it}} [...] "shows Madonna looking <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> has since at least 2005's video for 'Hung Up'. Of course there is the {{requisite}} writhing, hip grinding, a rousing dance sequence, and a smoldering mantourage. It is, in a word, awesome". HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, looking as if she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video. Caryn Ganz from Spin noticed that along with her old videos, Madonna also referenced her contemporary releases, like the videos for [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008) and [...] "Celebration", with the scenes showing her [...] "incredible" [...] dancing alone.|$|E

500|$|In the comics, the Rippers are {{considerably}} more kangaroo-like. However, Talalay wanted real actors rather than stuntmen in suits playing the roles. She asked Hewlett to redesign the Rippers {{to make them}} more human, allowing them to have the actual actors' facial expressions. Requests were sent out to [...] "all the major make-up and effects people", including Stan Winston, whose prior work included the Terminator films, Aliens, and Jurassic Park. Talalay said that while she considered Winston to be <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> <b>she</b> did not expect to hear back from him. When she did, she still did not think that {{she would be able to}} afford his studio on her budget. A meeting was arranged and Winston insisted on being given the project, saying the Rippers would be: [...] "the best characters we've had the opportunity to do." [...] Winston's studio cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget. Eight Rippers featured in the film: half were given principal roles, the others were mainly in the background. Each Ripper had articulated ears and tails which were activated by remote control, and the background Rippers also had mechanical snouts which could be activated either by remote control or by the movement of the actors' mouths. Each Ripper's make-up took about four hours to apply. Three technicians from Winston's studio were required to work on each Ripper's articulations during filming; no puppets or digital effects were used for the Rippers.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{read the}} script, {{described}} it as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> had ever read, and accepted the role. Within days, she joined the cast in San Francisco to begin filming. During production, she established what would become a lifelong friendship with her co-star, Anne Baxter, and a romantic relationship with her leading man, Gary Merrill, which led to marriage. The film's director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, later remarked, [...] "Bette was letter perfect. She was syllable-perfect. The director's dream: the prepared actress." ...|$|E
2500|$|The biographer of {{his sister}} Adeline's husband {{describes}} Charles Fisher as [...] "brilliant and most dashing of Adeline's brothers" [...] and tells how his death was [...] "a blow from which she never recovered".

It concludes, [...] "His college mourns in him one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> has known.

2500|$|Baldwin {{has called}} the {{attorneys}} in the case [...] "opportunists", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists {{as part of the}} [...] "divorce industry".

She is a person, like many of us, doing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever." [...] Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars, has had to put time aside from his career, has had to travel extensively, and needed to find a house in California (he lived in New York), so that he could stay in his daughter's life.|$|E

2500|$|... "Being {{an actress}} {{who uses the}} Stanislavsky method, I always try to find details about my character. With Pamela... I began with a class ring that I {{remember}} reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex—which is very bad of course—and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having... babies out of wedlock isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could, but {{he turned out to}} be a very strange boy. [...] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors." ...|$|E
