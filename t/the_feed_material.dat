5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons.

Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have [...] "legs" [...] that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.|$|E

40|$|The Saltstone {{facility}} has a grout hopper tank {{to provide a}}gitator stirring of <b>the</b> Saltstone <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> tank has about 300 gallon capacity to provide a larger working volume for the grout slurry {{to be held in}} case of a process upset, and it is equipped with a mechanical agitator, which is intended to keep the grout in motion and agitated so that it won't start to set up. <b>The</b> dry <b>feeds</b> and <b>the</b> salt solution are already mixed in the mixer prior to being transferred to the hopper tank. The hopper modeling study through this work will focus on fluid stirring and agitation, instead of traditional mixing in the literature, {{in order to keep the}} tank contents in motion during their residence time so that they will not be upset or solidified prior to transferring the grout to the Saltstone disposal facility. The primary objective of the work is to evaluate the flow performance for mechanical agitators to prevent vortex pull-through for an adequate stirring of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> and to estimate an agitator speed which provides acceptable flow performance with a 45 {sup o} pitched four-blade agitator. In addition, the power consumption required for the agitator operation was estimated. The modeling calculations were performed by taking two steps of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling approach. As a first step, a simple single-stage agitator model with 45 {sup o} pitched propeller blades was developed for the initial scoping analysis of the flow pattern behaviors for a range of different operating conditions. Based on the initial phase- 1 results, the phase- 2 model with a two-stage agitator was developed for the final performance evaluations. A series of sensitivity calculations for different designs of agitators and operating conditions have been performed to investigate the impact of key parameters on the grout hydraulic performance in a 300 -gallon hopper tank. For the analysis, viscous shear was modeled by using the Bingham plastic approximation. Steady state analyses with a two-equation turbulence model were performed with the FLUENT{trademark} codes. All analyses were based on three-dimensional results. Recommended operational guidance was developed by using the basic concept that local shear rate profiles and flow patterns can be used as a measure of hydraulic performance and spatial stirring. Flow patterns were estimated by a Lagrangian integration technique along the flow paths from <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>feed</b> inlet. <b>The</b> modeling results show that when the two-stage agitator consisting of a 45 {sup o} pitched propeller and radial flat-plate blades is run at 140 rpm speed with 28 in diameter, the agitator provides an adequate stirring of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> for a wide range of yield stresses (1 to 21 Pa) and the vortex system is shed into the remote region of the tank boundary by the blade passage in an efficient way.

50|$|The solids {{processing}} {{capacity of a}} thermal desorption system is inversely proportional to the moisture content of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material.</b> The presence of moisture in the excavated soils to be treated in the LTTD unit will determine the residence time required and heating requirements for effective removal of contaminants. In order for desorption of petroleum constituents to occur, most of the soil moisture must be evaporated in the desorber. This process can require significant additional thermal input to the desorber and excessive residence time for the soil in the desorber. Moisture content also influences plasticity which affects handling of the soil. Soils with excessive moisture content (> 20%) must be dewatered. Typical dewatering methods include air drying (if storage space is available to spread the soils), mixing with drier soils, or mechanical dewatering.|$|E

50|$|Steelmaking {{has existed}} for millennia, {{but it was not}} commercialized on a massive scale until the 19th century. The ancient craft process of {{steelmaking}} was the crucible process.

Today there are two major commercial processes for making steel, namely basic oxygen steelmaking, which has liquid pig-iron from the blast furnace and scrap steel as <b>the</b> main <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> and electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, which uses scrap steel or direct reduced iron (DRI) as <b>the</b> main <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Oxygen steelmaking is fuelled predominantly by the exothermic nature of the reactions inside the vessel where as in EAF steelmaking, electrical energy is used to melt the solid scrap and/or DRI materials.

The cylinder for full scale transportable systems is typically five to eight feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. With a carbon steel shell, the maximum solids temperature is around 1,000 °F, while temperatures of 1,800 °F with special alloy cylinders are attainable. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 2 to 30 tons per hour for transportable units.|$|E
50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the submerged-arc furnace through feed chutes {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. <b>The</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|E

The separator works on a very simple principle: that dissimilar materials will transfer electrical charge to one another when rubbed together, the resulting surface charge differences can then be used to separate these dissimilar materials from one another in an electric field. Various commingled plastics were tested under controlled operating conditions. <b>The</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> tested include commingled plastics derived from electronic shredder residue (ESR), automobile shredder residue (ASR), refrigerator liners, and water bottle plastics.
