5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> physician.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> technology. There are {{the risks associated with}} appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recently a {{relation}} between female sex hormones {{and severity of}} asthma symptoms has been proposed. As a common endocrine dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) could significantly influence the level of sex hormones in PCOS <b>patients.</b> Regarding <b>the</b> possible role of sex hormones in airway physiology, {{the present study was}} conducted to survey the effects of PCOS on pulmonary function test parameters. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 30 recently diagnosed patients with PCOS without history of pulmonary disease were enrolled and 20 healthy women were considered as the control group according to their age, weight, <b>and</b> height. <b>The</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> controls underwent body plethysmography to measure pulmonary function tests. Results: The mean age of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> controls were 29. 43 ± 7. 8 and 30. 0 ± 7. 6 years respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in all pulmonary function test parameters between <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> controls (p> 0. 05). After dividing <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> into 2 groups based on their body mass index (BMI), BMIConclusion: Our results showed that pulmonary function test parameters are not different in PCOS patients comparing to healthy women.

25|$|To {{increase}} the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with angiographic C-arms {{has proven to}} be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm are in exactly the same position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the accuracy is usually much higher than using pre-operative data.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{radiation}} is ionizing radiation, thus exposure is potentially harmful. Compared to a mobile C-Arm, which is classically used in surgery, CT scanners and fixed C-Arms {{work on a}} much higher energy level, which induces higher dose. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to monitor radiation dose applied in a hybrid OR both for <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> medical staff.|$|E
30|$|The {{strength}} {{of this study is}} its strict randomized design, <b>the</b> blinding of <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fact that the study was performed by the same group in the same center, precluding an operators’ bias.
