40|$|Thin {{sheet steel}} {{products}} are extensively used in building industry, and range from purloins to roof sheeting and floor decking. Generally these {{are available for}} use as basic building elements for assembly at site or as prefabricated frames or panels. These thin steel sections are cold-formed, i. e. their manufacturing process involves <b>forming</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> in a cold state (i. e. without application of heat) from steel sheets of uniform thickness. These are given the generic title Cold <b>Formed</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Sections.</b> Sometimes they are also called Light Gauge Steel Sections or Cold Rolled Steel Sections. The thickness of steel sheet used in cold formed construction is usually 1 to 3 mm. Much thicker material up to 8 mm can be formed if pre-galvanized material is not required for the particular application. The method of manufacturing is important as it differentiates these products from hot rolled steel sections. Normally, the yield strength of steel sheets used in cold-formed sections is at least 280 N/mm 2, {{although there is a}} trend to use steels of higher strengths, and sometimes as low as 230 N/mm 2.

The vacuum jacket consists of 0. 08 mm (0. 003 in.) <b>thick</b> 321 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>formed</b> into a wedge design that allows elastic jacket movements as the tank shrinks (cools) or expands (warms up or is pressurized).

The design, fabrication, and test effort developed the manufacturing methods and engineering data needed to scale the system to other tank sizes, shapes, and applications. The program demonstrated that thin wall jackets can be formed and welded to maintain the required vacuum level of. 013 Pa yet flex elastically for multiple reuses. No significant shifting or breakage of the microspheres occurred after 13 simulated Space Tug flight cycles on the test tank and a hundred 1 atmosphere load cycles in a flat plate calorimeter.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} beam in buildings has {{known to be}} more economical compared to bare steel beams with hot-rolled steel section, as the composite action between steel and concrete results in significant savings in steel weight and reduce the beam depth. However, the use of {{composite beam}} with cold-formed steel of lipped C-channel {{is yet to be}} established as the structural behavior of such beam is not well understood. This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with cold <b>formed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>section</b> and innovative shear connectors. The composite beam comprises two cold <b>formed</b> <b>steel</b> of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of bracket shear connectors namely single bracket (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and hot rolled plate (HPSC) shear connectors were developed and used; the proposed shear connectors were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed stud (HSSC) shear connector welded to the top flange of cold <b>formed</b> <b>steel</b> beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed shear connectors. Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed shear connectors. The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all bracket shear connectors suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of shear connector increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed stud shear connectors, the stud possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite cold <b>formed</b> <b>steel</b> beam. Composite beam with HSSC shear connectors showed the best performance as compared to composite beams with SBSC, DBSC and HPSC shear connectors.

Several approaches have been utilized to model the geometric imperfections. First, the elastic buckling modes were considered as the imperfect beam shape. In this approach, the elastic buckling analysis was done first to get the elastic buckling modes. In the second approach, the imperfections were considered by assuming the beam bent in a half sine wave along its length. Finally, combination of these two approaches was considered. Results reveal that, the ultimate bending moments of beams with short and intermediate overall slenderness ratios are sensitive to the imperfect shape that comprise compression flange local buckling...|$|R
