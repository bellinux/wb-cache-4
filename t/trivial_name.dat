5|$|The <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> {{acetic acid}} {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic name ethanoic acid, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. The name acetic acid derives from acetum, the Latin word for vinegar, and is related to the word acid itself.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
25|$|If {{replacing}} the aldehyde {{group with a}} carboxyl group (−COOH) would yield a carboxylic acid with a <b>trivial</b> <b>name,</b> the aldehyde may be named by {{replacing the}} suffix -ic acid or -oic acid in this <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> by -aldehyde.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{molecular}} phylogeny, many higher taxonomic groupings had only <b>trivial</b> <b>names,</b> which are still used today, {{some of which are}} polyphyletic, such as Rhizobacteria. Some higher taxonomic <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> are: ...|$|R
30|$|Aldrin has {{a number}} of {{alternative}} <b>trivial</b> <b>names.</b> In SciFinder, these names searched as a ‘research topic’ produce in all cases the same number of hits as the chemical name search on aldrin itself. The lesser used <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> are directly translated to the registry number in the database. This seems to be the general procedure with the variety of <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> and works very well in SciFinder. The number of articles registered by WoS seems to be significantly smaller in all cases (Tables  5, 6). If we apply the many different <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> for Aldrin mentioned above, it produces no futher hits in WoS. This demonstrates the value of the name concordance in the SciFinder database.|$|R

25|$|In chemistry, a <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> is a nonsystematic {{name for}} a {{chemical}} substance. That is, the name is not recognized {{according to the rules}} of any formal system of chemical nomenclature such as IUPAC inorganic or IUPAC organic nomenclature. A <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> is not a formal name and is usually a common name.|$|E
25|$|The <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> ozone is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic names 2λ4-trioxidiene and catena-trioxygen, valid IUPAC names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ozone derives from ozein (ὄζειν), the Greek verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{names of}} {{elements}} are trivial, some originating in alchemy. IUPAC has accepted these names, but has also defined systematic names of elements {{that have not}} yet been prepared. It has adopted a procedure by which the scientists who are credited with preparing an element can propose a new name. Once the IUPAC has accepted such a (<b>trivial)</b> <b>name,</b> it replaces the systematic name.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trivial</b> <b>names</b> often {{arise in}} the common language; they may come from {{historic}} usages in, for example, alchemy. Many <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> pre-date the institution of formal naming conventions. Names can {{be based on a}} property of the chemical, including appearance (color, taste or smell), consistency, and crystal structure; a place where it was found or where the discoverer comes from; the name of a scientist; a mythological figure; an astronomical body; the shape of the molecule; and even fictional figures. All elements that have been isolated have <b>trivial</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{considering}} this subject {{it is helpful}} to distinguish between ames and words. Mineral species are usually referred to by <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> and the acceptance of these is guided by international rules of con-duct. It is generally agreed that suggestions for new <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> should be circulated privately for comment and should not be printed until there is near unanimity on their desirability. Group names on the other hand have in them much of the character of ordinary words, like fruit, poultry, bricks and the like, and are not <b>trivial</b> <b>names.</b> <b>Trivial</b> <b>names</b> sometimes do, but definitely need not have, a semantic ontent; but group words should have meaning and acceptability. One should pay attention, in considering roup names, not only to the international rules of good nomenclatural manners, but also to semantics and communications theory. It is irrelevant o say that group names are "superfluous " or "unnecessary "; words are never superfluous as long as some peopl...|$|R
25|$|The formal {{naming of}} haloalkanes should follow IUPAC nomenclature, which put the halogen as a prefix to the alkane. For example, ethane with bromine becomes bromoethane, methane with four {{chlorine}} groups becomes tetrachloromethane. However, {{many of these}} compounds have already an established <b>trivial</b> <b>name,</b> which is endorsed by the IUPAC nomenclature, for example chloroform (trichloromethane) and methylene chloride (dichloromethane). For unambiguity, this article follows the systematic naming scheme throughout.|$|E
25|$|In {{systematic}} chemical nomenclature, alkynes {{are named}} with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with {{four or more}} carbons, {{it is necessary to}} say where the triple bond is located. For octyne, one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number possible is given to the triple bond. When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the triple bond even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> acetylene.|$|E
500|$|The {{elements}} of group 12 {{have been found}} throughout history, being used since ancient times to being discovered in laboratories. [...] The group itself has not acquired a <b>trivial</b> <b>name,</b> {{but it has been}} called group IIB in the past.|$|E

25|$|The <b>trivial</b> (non-systematic) <b>name</b> for alkanes is {{paraffin}}s. Together, alkanes {{are known}} as the paraffin series. <b>Trivial</b> <b>names</b> for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.|$|R
500|$|E. coli is {{the type}} species of the genus (Escherichia) and in turn Escherichia {{is the type}} genus of the family Enterobacteriaceae, where the family name does not stem from the genus Enterobacter + [...] "i" [...] (sic.) + [...] "aceae", but from [...] "enterobacterium" [...] + [...] "aceae" [...] (enterobacterium being not a genus, but an {{alternative}} <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> to enteric bacterium).|$|E
500|$|After 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev {{proposed}} his {{periodic table}} placing lithium {{at the top}} of a group with sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and thallium. Two years later, Mendeleev revised his table, placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium, and also moving thallium to the boron group. In this 1871 version, copper, silver, and gold were placed twice, once as part of group IB, and once as part of a [...] "group VIII" [...] encompassing today's groups 8 to 11. After the introduction of the 18-column table, the group IB elements were moved to their current position in the d-block, while alkali metals were left in group IA. Later the group's name was changed to group 1 in 1988. The <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> [...] "alkali metals" [...] comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water.|$|E

50|$|The suffix -ium {{overrides}} traditional chemical suffix rules; thus elements 117 and 118 were ununseptium and ununoctium, not ununseptine and ununocton. This {{does not}} apply to the final <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> these elements receive once confirmed; thus element 117 and 118 are now tennessine and oganesson. For these <b>trivial</b> <b>names,</b> all elements receive the suffix -ium, except those in group 17 which receive -ine (like the halogens) and those in group 18 which receive -on (like the noble gases).|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>trivial</b> <b>names,</b> chemists have constructed semi-trivial names by appending a standard symbol to a trivial stem. Some <b>trivial</b> and semi-trivial <b>names</b> are so widely used {{that they have}} been officially adopted by IUPAC; these are known as retained names.|$|R
50|$|When {{they fit}} into the general pattern of {{systematic}} nomenclature, some traditional and <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> for polymers in common usage, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, are retained.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{multiple}} conventions for naming polymer substances. Many commonly used polymers, {{such as those}} found in consumer products, are referred to by a common or <b>trivial</b> <b>name.</b> The <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> is assigned based on historical precedent or popular usage rather than a standardized naming convention. Both the American Chemical Society (ACS) and IUPAC have proposed standardized naming conventions; the ACS and IUPAC conventions are similar but not identical. Examples {{of the differences between}} the various naming conventions are given in the table below: ...|$|E
2500|$|DHA's {{structure}} is a carboxylic acid (-oic acid) with a 22-carbon chain (docosa- is Greek for 22) [...] and six (hexa-) cis double bonds (-en-); {{with the first}} double bond located at the third carbon from the omega end. Its <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> is cervonic acid, its systematic name is all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexa-enoic acid, and its shorthand name is 22:6(n-3) in the nomenclature of fatty acids.|$|E
2500|$|Many trivial names {{continue}} to be used because their sanctioned equivalents are considered too cumbersome for everyday use. [...] For example, [...] "tartaric acid", a compound found in wine, has a systematic name of 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. The pigment β-Carotene has an IUPAC name of 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene. However, the <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> can be potentially confusing. Based on their names, one might infer that α-Carotene, β-Carotene, δ-Carotene and ζ-Carotene are closely related in structure, origin or function, but they are not.|$|E
50|$|The suffix {{also appears}} in some <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> with {{reference}} to oils (from Latin oleum, oil). Examples of this sense of the suffix include benzol, eugenol, urushiol, xylol, and menthol.|$|R
500|$|Some {{of these}} groups have been given <b>trivial</b> (unsystematic) <b>names,</b> {{as seen in the}} table below, {{although}} some are rarely used. Groups 3–10 have no <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group (such as [...] "the scandium group" [...] for group 3), since they display fewer similarities and/or vertical trends.|$|R
50|$|The {{muskellunge}} {{is known}} {{by a wide}} variety of <b>trivial</b> <b>names</b> including Ohio muskellunge, Great Lakes muskellunge, barred muskellunge, Ohio River pike, Allegheny River pike, jack pike, unspotted muskellunge and the Wisconsin muskellunge.|$|R
2500|$|Formic acid, systemically named methanoic acid, is the {{simplest}} carboxylic acid. The chemical formula is HCOOH or HCO2H. It {{is an important}} intermediate in chemical synthesis and occurs naturally, most notably in some ants. The word [...] "formic" [...] comes from the Latin word for ant, formica, referring to its early isolation by the distillation of ant bodies, and the <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> in some languages means [...] "ant-acid", such as Dutch , Danish , Faroese , Français [...] and German [...] Esters, salts, and the anions derived from formic acid are called formates.|$|E
2500|$|... {{referred}} to as a <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> nomen triviale consisting of a single word, normally a Latin adjective, but any single word would suffice, to identify a particular species, but not intended to describe it. He developed a coherent system for naming organisms and divided the plant kingdom into 25 classes (according to Smith p.1 and p.24 according to Dixon, 1973) (Smith, 1955 p.1), one of which, the Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive organs. He divided the Cryptogamia into four orders: Filices, Musci (mosses), Algae — which included lichens and liverworts and fungi (Smith, 1955 p.1).|$|E
2500|$|Generally, trivial {{names are}} not useful in {{describing}} the essential properties of the thing being named. Properties such as the molecular structure of a chemical compound are not indicated. And, in some cases, trivial names can be ambiguous or will carry different meanings in different industries or in different geographic regions. (For example, a <b>trivial</b> <b>name</b> such as white metal can mean various things.) On the other hand, systematic names can be so convoluted and difficult to parse that their trivial names are preferred. [...] As a result, {{a limited number of}} trivial chemical names are retained names, an accepted part of the nomenclature.|$|E
5000|$|With {{automated}} testing, a {{test failure}} may indicate {{anything from a}} critical issue to a violation of a <b>trivial</b> <b>naming</b> standard. With continuous testing, a test failure always indicates a critical business risk.|$|R
50|$|Systematic names often co-exist {{with earlier}} common names {{assigned}} before {{the creation of}} any systematic naming system. For example, many common chemicals are still referred to by their common or <b>trivial</b> <b>names,</b> even by chemists.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trivial</b> <b>names,</b> however, are {{not useful}} for most other {{oligosaccharides}} and, as such, systematic {{rules for the}} nomenclature of carbohydrates have been developed.
