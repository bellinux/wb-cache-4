5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by {{the manner in which}} <b>they</b> <b>taught</b> him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E

With this technique, student didnot feel bored and they interested {{in the classroom and}} also can build effective teams and teams work. In this technique, the students are divided into some groups consisting students who have different achievement. Students from different group who get the same topic will discuss together in group. After that, they have to describe one of the pictures in front of other group. The formulations of the research problem were: 1) How is student’s speaking ability before <b>they</b> are <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction in descriptive text? 2) How is student’s speaking ability after <b>they</b> are <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction in descriptive text? 3) Is there any significant differences between student’s speaking ability before <b>they</b> are <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction in descriptive text and after <b>they</b> are <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction?
