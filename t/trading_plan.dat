5|$|The Commercial Import Program, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Commodity Import Program (CIP), was an economic aid arrangement between South Vietnam and its main supporter, the United States. It lasted from January 1955 until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the dissolution of South Vietnam following the invasion by North Vietnam after US forces had withdrawn from the country due to the 1973 cease-fire agreement. The initiative was a <b>trading</b> <b>plan</b> {{that was designed to}} inject large amounts of American capital into the South Vietnamese economy to help fuel its industrialisation, growth and self-sufficiency, without incurring the high levels of inflation that would normally occur in such a drastic injection of money.|$|E

Many recent studies have opened up towards the paradigm shift in rational thinking problem. This thesis deals {{with the issue of}} asymmetric information interpretation during altered mental states. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover the effect on agent's behaviour using a practical tool such as a daily <b>trade</b> <b>plan.</b> If traders succumb to irrationality, they probably make poor choices below their potential levels. Therefore the experiment was conducted with students of FM VŠE. The variables were measured before and after the intervention which was applying the <b>trade</b> <b>plan.</b> The additional data collection mapped the personal context of self-reflection and management of well-being. The results indicate the advantage of using the daily <b>trade</b> <b>plan</b> for manipulating the factors that can negatively influence the quality of decision-making...|$|R
40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission {{is poised}} to take action {{in the face of}} {{compelling}} evidence that corporate insiders are availing themselves of rule-sanctioned <b>Trading</b> <b>Plans</b> to beat the market. These <b>Trading</b> <b>Plans</b> allow insiders to trade while aware of material nonpublic information. Since the market advantage insiders have enjoyed from <b>Plan</b> <b>trading</b> can be traced to loopholes in the current regulatory scheme, increased enforcement of the existing rules cannot address the issue. But, simply tweaking the existing rule structure to close these loopholes would not work either. This is because the SEC adopted the current rule {{as a part of a}} delicate compromise with the courts in the “use versus possession” debate over the proper test of scienter for insider trading liability. The current rule reflects the SEC’s preferred test (mere “awareness”), but it provides for <b>Trading</b> <b>Plans</b> as an affirmative defense in order to pass judicial scrutiny. Thus, any attempt to simply close the loopholes in <b>Trading</b> <b>Plans</b> while maintaining the awareness test would upset this delicate compromise. Only a comprehensive change to the current insider trading enforcement regime can address the issue. The reform proposed here begins with the recognition that <b>Plan</b> <b>trading</b> is generally done with the firm’s awareness and consent. Such trading is therefore a form of issuer-licensed insider trading. Since there are strong arguments that there is no moral wrong or economic harm done by issuer-licensed insider trading, the regulatory regime should openly embrace it as a permissible form of compensation through firm-sanctioned Modified <b>Trading</b> <b>Plans,</b> so long as there is adequate disclosure. Though such liberalization would represent a radical departure from the current enforcement regime, it would be within the SEC’s rulemaking authority, and would be consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Most importantly, it would dramatically improve the current enforcement regime in terms of justice, clarity, efficiency, and coherence. It is sometimes said there is nothing like a good crisis for effecting much needed change. The current media attention and public scrutiny over corporate insiders’ exploitation of rule-sanctioned <b>Trading</b> <b>Plans</b> may be just the crisis to spur the SEC to adopt a more rational and just approach to insider trading enforcement. The outline for such reform is proposed here...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{we will look at}} gender {{differences}} in sentiment driven investing. It extends a study by Kaplanski et al. [15] on the influence of sentiment on risk and return expectations and future <b>trading</b> <b>plans.</b> The gender differences in risk and return expectations and <b>trading</b> <b>plans</b> are researched, as well as the gender differences in sentiment and sentiment-creating factors. Lastly, we have also researched the influence of a sentiment index, consisting of a linear combination of the sentiment-creating variables, on the risk and return expectations and <b>trading</b> <b>plans</b> for men and women separately. We find that men expect higher returns and a lower volatility than women and that men trade more. We also find that men and women have no difference in their general feeling and weather perception. They do however differ in the fact that men have a favorite sports team more often than women and that men suffer less from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) than women. When examining the relationship between sentiment and investing for men and women with the sentiment index, we find no significant relation between sentiment and expected risk and return. We do find gender differences in sentiment driven <b>trading</b> <b>plans,</b> more positive sentiment directs women more towards buying instead of selling than men. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} decade, power {{industry}} has been un-dergoing deregulations to introduce competitions among market participants. Once centralized decision making must now adapt to the new market structure. The optimal cross-border electricity <b>trade</b> <b>planning</b> {{is an important issue}} in interconnected power sys-tems under transmission open access. In this paper a decentralized approach is suggested to solve the problem using multi-agent tech-nology. In the new approach rational market participants make decisions based on their own benefits, in the meantime the min-imum production and transmission cost of the whole system can be reached without a central coordination except necessary informa-tion exchange through media like the Internet. A relevant lemma has been proven. The approach is implemented via a multi-agent system using Java programming language. Computer tests on a 5 -area test system show that the suggested new approach is effec-tive and promising.
