[...] Dave Walker from The Times-Picayune complimented Gaga's vocals, likening them to that of singer Liza Minnelli. CNET's Ty Pendlebury was present during the recording of the special and remarked that [...] "without the autotune and other electronic fiddling, Lady Gaga can really sing", but found Bennett's voice to be [...] "bit croaky" [...] sometimes. He also noticed that the whole concert was especially filmed for television, without any audience interraction and [...] "dead silences in between songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critic Green Baron {{reviewed}} {{the music for}} Sputnikmusic, and said: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club itself was a breathtaking motion picture driven by the extraordinary performances from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Its accompanying soundtrack, however, is less than satisfying. Filled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> lifeless, stale indie-rock tracks, the supporting album {{to one of the}} year's most gripping films is a complete waste of talent and potential." [...] Baron thought that Dallas Buyers Club was saved by a few excellent songs, which were [...] "Ready to Be Called On", [...] "After the Scripture", and [...] "City of Angels". He said that, [...] "Overall, the Dallas Buyers Club soundtrack is one that really isn't worth your time or money. Aside from three superb songs, the whole album is a collection of drab indie pop/rock that ultimately falls flat due to its lack of memorability." ...|$|E

40|$|Quadrilateral shaped brims made of ifigh-density {{polyethylene}} {{have been}} used with satisfactory results on more than 120 patients who needed ischial-bearing long leg calipers. At first the fitting technique {{was the same as}} that used for thigh amputees. Subsequently it has been possible to fit most patients from a range of pre-formed <b>brims.</b> <b>The</b> properties of high-density polyethylene allow the caliper side irons to be riveted directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> which, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of ready-made brims, allows a patient to be fitted rapidly with a comfortable and effective caliper. <b>The</b> quadrilateral shaped <b>brim</b> has been used for many years by prosthetists in parts of Europe for fitting thigh amputees. In 1946 a team of Americans visited Europe to study European prosthetic techniques and were particularly impressed by the fittings of Strieda in Kufstein, Austria (Radcliffe 1973). After this visit a reproducible and teachable technique of socket fitting for thigh amputees using a quadrilateral shaped brim was developed at the University of California, Berkele...|$|R

However, Hacker tells him that the Treasury is causing problems. Thorn counters that he is serious about his proposal and will publicly resign if necessary. While Thorn waits outside, Sir Humphrey comes back in with news that the Treasury can encompass the PM’s tax cut, {{with the proviso that}} the anti-smoking policy is shelved. Hacker agrees, but tells him of Thorn’s threat. Sir Humphrey suggests that Thorn be promoted to a vacancy at the Treasury. After Thorn is placated by his rapid elevation (with the promise that his proposal isn’t dropped) the position of Minister for Health is given to Leslie Potts, whose smoker’s cough prevents him from expressing his agreement.|$|R
500|$|While lamenting that Songs by George Harrison was [...] "an heirloom-quality item (with a {{price to}} match)", and so {{prohibitive}} {{to the majority of}} Harrison's audience, author Robert Rodriguez considers that Warner Bros. [...] "displayed appalling judgment" [...] in overlooking [...] "Sat Singing" [...] and particularly [...] "Flying Hour", which he describes as [...] "a breezy tune filled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> hooks". Simon Leng admires the reinterpretation of [...] "For You Blue" [...] as a rhythm and blues [...] "jam track" [...] and praises [...] "Sat Singing" [...] for its [...] "melody of some beauty, colored by warm, golden slide guitar". Leng adds that [...] "As a musical essay on serenity and joy, [...] is one of Harrison's best", yet he also identifies an isolationist perspective on the three 1980 recordings that reflected the singer's failure to appreciate the market forces with which Warner's had to contend.|$|E
500|$|Soul Food Taqueria {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. Exclaim! editor Noel Dix observed {{an improvement in}} production and complexity of instrumentation by Guerrero from his earlier work, and stated, [...] "This record pours so much heart and emotion into it that you’re bound to feel its warmth and splendor while it’s bumping in your walkman as you trek the city streets." [...] Noting that A Little Bit of Somethin was criticized as a [...] "lifeless piece of pop-trip-hop", Brian Ho of Dusted praised Guerrero's artistic growth and found [...] "everything" [...] to be [...] "an improvement over its predecssor", writing that the album [...] "is filled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> body and life {{in a way that}} few albums can claim". XLR8R critic Liz Cordingley called the album a [...] "nice case of dubby, electric guitar-driven downtempo", and called its music [...] "dusty lo-fi soul that is seductively languid". Joe Warminsky of the Washington City Paper praised Guerrero's minimalist approach to the album's chill-out sound, as the chill-out music genre mostly features implementation of a slicker production. He also compared the lo-fi grooves of Soul Food Taqueria to [...] "Shuggie Otis with Baja roots". Carmen Johnson of Prefix Mag called it a [...] "stellar follow-up to 2000's A Little Bit of Somethin", and commended Guerrero for producing [...] "his own organic, subterranean blend of bohemian blues, hip-hop and salsa that's creative and adventurous". Johnson called it [...] "the perfect soundtrack for the lazy days that hearken back to the end of summer." ...|$|E
500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her {{on the list of}} [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head." [...] Playboy included Mileena, Kitana, and Jade together in their list of [...] "the hottest video game breasts of all time" [...] at 19th place.|$|E

The bullying is broken up by the appearance of Jöns, who once again recognises Raval: true to his word, he slashes and permanently scars the theologian's face. Both knight and squire are reacquainted with Jof's family, with a repentant Plog also joining them. The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by Mia.

The {{top of the}} crown is stitched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> in a flat seam, with fullness created in the lower crown {{through a set of}} 3 snaps on each side which fasten <b>the</b> crown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim,</b> giving <b>the</b> lower crown a crenelated shape. The bonnet has no tail, and has self-fabric chin ties of blue ribbon. The left tie is formed from two pieces of fabric pieced together, while the right tie is of a single length of fabric. The ties are narrow hemmed, except for one side of a lower section of left tie, which is cut along the selvage and left unfinished. There are no labels or marks in the piece. The fact that this bonnet does not have a tail probably indicates that this was a visiting bonnet rather than a field bonnet.
