We have studied the effects of castanospermine (Cas), swainsonine (Swain), 1 -deoxynojirimycin (dNM), and 1 -deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) on T cell activation and differentiation. Our analysis included a new dNM derivative, N-pentyl- 1 -deoxynojirimycin (pentyldNM). Previous reports showed inhibitory action of trimming inhibitors, such as Swain and Cas, on pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin (Ig) production. We extend these findings for pentyldNM and observed that glucosidase inhibitors, Cas and pentyldNM were effective in inhibiting CD 2 and CD 3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) driven Ig production. The pattern of inhibition by mannosidase and glucosidase inhibitors correlated with inhibitory action on T cell activation: only glucosidase trimming inhibitors (Cas and pentyldNM with comparable potency) perturbed mAb-induced T cell activation, in particular if induced by CD 2 mAb. Expression of the early activation marker CD 69 was not decreased in the presence of these inhibitors, while addition of exogenous recombinant interleukin- 2 partially overcame inhibitory effects during proliferation. These findings suggest that glucosidase, but not mannosidase, trimming inhibitors interfere with a late phase of T cell activation. In addition, the enhanced sensitivity of CD 2 mAb-induced proliferation for glucosidase trimming inhibitors suggests dependence on N-linked glycans during CD 2 -mediated adhesion and triggering function...|$|R
