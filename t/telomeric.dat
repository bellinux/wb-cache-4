5|$|The {{karyotype}} of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost invisible) and one small pair is metacentric (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. <b>Telomeric</b> sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with {{a high number of}} mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus. Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in Nectomys palmipes, although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomeric</b> {{regions of}} DNA were first {{identified}} in the late 1970s (See: Discovery of <b>Telomeric</b> DNA). However, extremely long regions of telomere sequence were not recognized in vertebrates until over a decade later. These sequences, which ranged from 30 to 150 kilobases in size, were first identified in laboratory mice by David Kipling and Howard Cooke in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In birds, whose cells contain microchromosomes, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that there was a correlation between the presence of mega-telomeres and the number of microchromosomes present in a species, such that bird genomes with large numbers of microchromosomes also possessed larger amounts of <b>telomeric</b> DNA sequence. It was thought that these <b>telomeric</b> sequences might protect genes on these tiny chromosomes from erosion during cell division. However, subsequent studies showed that mega-telomeres are not necessarily present in all species with microchromosomes, nor are they found on all microchromosomes within a cell. Mega-telomeres are also thought contribute to the high recombination rate of chicken microchromosomes. The longest mega-telomere in chickens is associated with the W (female) chromosome, suggesting that mega-telomeres may also affect sex chromosome organization and the generation of genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|CCDC142 {{is found}} on the – strand of {{chromosome}} 2 (2p13.1), with the genomic sequence spanning bases 74,472,832 to 74,483,230. The coding region is 8292 base pairs long, encoding for two protein isoforms 743 to 665 amino acids in length. On the <b>telomeric</b> side, CCDC142 {{is followed by the}} MOGS and MRPL53 genes. On the centromeric side, it is followed by the C31, LBX2, LBX2-AS1, and PCGF1 genes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies in}} model organisms have {{established}} {{the significance of}} telomere structure and function in regulating genome stability, cellular aging, and oncogenesis. It {{has been suggested that}} mega-teleomeres may serve as protective mechanism against senescence in long-lived organisms. However, there is some debate on the topic, since <b>telomeric</b> length does not seem to affect lifespan in mice and birds with both long and short life-spans have been shown to have mega-telomeres.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of mega-telomeres varies between species. For example, human chromosomes {{do not have}} mega-telomeres while mice and many species of birds do. There is also variation in their structure and location within the same species. In mice and birds, mega-telomeres regions are observed to be hypervariable, meaning {{that there is a}} high degree of polymorphism in the size and position of mega-telomeres between individuals, including those of highly inbred lines. Analysis of siblings from highly inbred chicken-lines have suggested that these ultra-long <b>telomeric</b> sequences are extremely heterogenous. Similar observations of heterogeneity have also been made in mice.|$|E
25|$|For these transformations {{to lead to}} the {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short <b>telomeric</b> repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the cytoplasm. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.|$|E
25|$|The end {{replication}} {{problem is}} handled in eukaryotic cells by telomere regions and telomerase. Telomeres extend the 3' {{end of the}} parental chromosome beyond the 5' end of the daughter strand. This single-stranded DNA structure can act as an origin of replication that recruits telomerase. Telomerase is a specialized DNA polymerase that consists of multiple protein subunits and an RNA component. The RNA component of telomerase anneals to the single stranded 3' end of the template DNA and contains 1.5 copies of the <b>telomeric</b> sequence. Telomerase contains a protein subunit that is a reverse transcriptase called telomerase reverse transcriptase or TERT. TERT synthesizes DNA {{until the end of}} the template telomerase RNA and then disengages. This process can be repeated as many times as needed with the extension of the 3' end of the parental DNA molecule. This 3' addition provides a template for extension of the 5' end of the daughter strand by lagging strand DNA synthesis. Regulation of telomerase activity is handled by telomere-binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|One type of non-homologous based {{mechanism}} is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are {{also involved in}} repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another {{mechanism is}} the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its <b>telomeric</b> region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one dicentric chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading {{to an increase in}} copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and {{it is unlikely that the}} polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.|$|E

2500|$|Compared {{to other}} tissues in the body, {{the brain is}} deemed unusually {{sensitive}} to oxidative damage. Increased oxidative damage {{has been associated with}} neurodegenerative diseases, mild cognitive impairment and individual differences in cognition in healthy elderly people. [...] In 'normal aging', the brain is undergoing oxidative stress in a multitude of ways. [...] The main contributors include protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and oxidative modifications in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. [...] Oxidative stress can damage DNA replication and inhibit repair through many complex processes, including telomere shortening in DNA components. [...] Each time a somatic cell replicates, the <b>telomeric</b> DNA component shortens. [...] As telomere length is partly inheritable, there are individual differences in the age of onset of cognitive decline.|$|E
2500|$|P {{elements}} are {{a family of}} transposons that recently proliferated within the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. [...] The P elements have an extremely high transposition rate and induce sterility and abnormal gonad development in D. melanogaster (Johnson, 2). [...] The flies thus developed a maternally inherited technique for combating the invasive DNA and silencing the transposons, now known as P cytotype. P cytotype detects DNA sequences in areas of <b>telomeric</b> heterochromatin and silences those sequences when they are found elsewhere in the genome. This {{is referred to as}} the telomeric-silencing effect (TSE) (2). [...] Just two P elements in the telomere are enough to suppress over 80 other copies of the P element in the genome. [...] The cytoplasmic factor used for TSE builds up over generations and suppression of the transposons is not fully effective unless the fly’s female-line ancestors have had the P element for six generations (2).|$|E

50|$|Telomeres {{form the}} {{terminal}} region of mammalian chromosomes and {{are essential for}} stability and aging and play central roles in diseases such as cancer. Telomeres have been long considered transcriptionally inert DNA-protein complexes until it was recently shown that <b>telomeric</b> repeats may be transcribed as <b>telomeric</b> RNAs (TelRNAs) or <b>telomeric</b> repeat-containing RNAs. These ncRNAs are heterogeneous in length, transcribed from several sub-telomeric loci and physically localise to telomeres. Their association with chromatin, which suggests an involvement in regulating telomere specific heterochromatin modifications, is repressed by SMG proteins that protect chromosome ends from telomere loss. In addition, TelRNAs block telomerase activity in vitro and may therefore regulate telomerase activity. Although early, these studies suggest an involvement for <b>telomeric</b> ncRNAs in various aspects of telomere biology.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} of Q-FISH is {{the detection of}} <b>telomeric</b> fusions, where the ends of chromosomes have been fused together at the telomere, which are sometimes called interstitial (within the chromosome) <b>telomeric</b> sequences (ITSs).

Observing the regulation of telomere length in different species also reveals important information about karyotype evolution and relevance to human illnesses.|$|E

50|$|The {{digestion}} of DNA {{into smaller}} fragments by restriction enzymes, separation of variable-sized DNA fragments via electrophoresis, and labeling of fragments containing <b>telomeric</b> DNA using a specific radio- or fluorescently-labeled probe are the essential steps completed within many molecular techniques. In many cases, the DNA fragments are transferred to distinctive membranes before labeling via blotting techniques (i.e. Southern blot). Specialized protocols {{have demonstrated the}} ability to isolate high molecular weight Class III <b>telomeric</b> DNA from Class I and II fragments as well as characterize the size ranges found within each class. The pattern of the <b>telomeric</b> fragments on the stained or labeled membrane is typically unique to the DNA sample (i.e. telomere arrays are rarely identical). Molecular weight markers are usually separated via electrophoresis through agarose gel along with genomic DNA fragments to aid in sizing <b>telomeric</b> arrays and identifying array inter- and intra- individual variability. Slot blot, however, is conducted without DNA fragmentation or separation, rather whole genomic DNA is used to quantify the total concentration of <b>telomeric</b> DNA. The flaw of this technique is {{that the size of}} the labelled DNA molecules cannot be identified. In slot blot (or dot blot), total genomic DNA is attached to a membrane and labeled with a telomere-probe that produces a sample-specific chemiluminescence signal, which is captured and quantified by fluorometer equipment and software. A known concentration standard must be labeled and quantified simultaneously in order to accurately determine the <b>telomeric</b> sequence concentration in the DNA samples.|$|E
