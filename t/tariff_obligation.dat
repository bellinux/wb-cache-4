40|$|Regulation binds {{incumbent}} {{firms to}} {{a different set of}} obligations from their entrant-competitors thereby creating an asymmetric set of options from which the firms may select the strategies under which they will interact. Whilst most regulatory obligations are specified in law some take the form of contractual agreements. New Zealand's 'Kiwi Share' obligations bind the incumbent to a set of retail tariff structures and levels that have both restricted the incumbent's choices and opened up a range of new strategic opportunities for its rivals that have had a significant effect upon the development of the New Zealand industry. This paper examines the specific consequences of the asymmetric <b>tariff</b> <b>obligations</b> and ensuing strategic interaction amongst sector participants on sector development - namely the effect of universal service retail prices and the allocation of the ensuing costs on the sector's ongoing regulatory agenda; the role of a 'free local calling' obligation on the evolution of New Zealand's broadband market; and the consequent application of further asymmetric legislative obligations on the incumbent to address apparent "problems" for which the asymmetric tariffs and rivals' strategic choices provide more credible explanations than the incumbent's exertion of its dominant position...|$|R

A panel of 14 OECD countries were analysed using patent counts for the period 1978 - 2009 as a proxy for innovations. The policies examined were feed-in <b>tariffs,</b> quota <b>obligations</b> and different types of investment support schemes. The study found that feed-in tariffs affected innovation positively but quota obligations did not. The results regarding investment support programs were ambiguous since the dummy variable representing strong investment policies was statistically significant whereas the continuous variable for investment support schemes was not. Another finding was that electricity prices seemed to be an important determinant of innovation and that the accumulated stock of knowledge in the bioenergy sector also had a positive impact on bioenergy innovation.

40|$|The UK has enviable {{renewable}} resources, both onshore (wind) {{and offshore}} (wind, wave and tidal) (The Offshore Valuation Group, 2010). The government has had policy mechanisms {{in place since}} 1990 to encourage these resources to be developed. The current mechanism, the Renewables Obligation (RO), was specifically designed to emphasise competition and therefore {{to fit in with}} the UK's overall strategic approach to energy policy. However, as yet, it has not delivered the capacity that it was designed to do, and as a result the UK faces a difficult challenge in attempting to meet European-wide renewable energy targets for 2020, as well as longer term decarbonisation targets. This paper explores some of the major reasons why the RO has performed so poorly to date and considers the prospects for improvement up to 2020. It concludes that the strategic emphasis on competition in the support mechanisms has {{played a key role in}} limiting renewables development, but that the mechanism has changed significantly since it was introduced.

It finds it indisputable that Union law applies in its own internal waters and territorial seas that Nord Stream 2 will pass through, and highly probable that Union law applies in the exclusive economic zone through which Nord Stream 2 will also passes. It goes on to argue that Nord Stream 2 is a transmission pipeline under EU law to which {{the full weight of}} the EU’s liberalisation measures apply, including ownership unbundling, third party access and <b>tariff</b> regulation <b>obligations.</b> It further argues that not only will Nord Stream 2 find it difficult to comply with the liberalisation obligations, but also that it {{will not be able to}} obtain Article 11 security of supply certification required under the Gas Directive. The paper also examines the options for applying an intergovernmental agreement solution to reconcile Nord Stream 2 with EU law. It argues that while the legal problems arising from an agreement between the Russian Federation and one or more EU states make such an agreement improbable, the political problems in obtaining a mandate to negotiate an agreement from the Council at EU level also make an EU-Russia agreement unlikely. It goes on to argue that Nord Stream 2 cuts across the Union’s energy security principles enshrined in Council and Commission documents on Energy Union. Finally, the paper argues that Russia and the EU should move beyond diversionary pipeline disputes to making the most out of developing a gas single market from which both can benefit...|$|R

With these goals in mind, most African countries have undertaken revenue administration reforms and from the early 1990 s, 16 of 19 Anglophone Africa countries established some form of revenue authority (RA) for greater governance, financing, and workforce autonomy. Changes in governance and HR practices are evident, but has revenue administration improved overall? Capacity limitations and integrity issues persist.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{the development of new}} technologies in the energy industry and to explore how it is possible for these technologies to compete with incumbent technologies in a mature market. The pursuit of renewable energy has {{been at the forefront of}} national government and international institutional policy in recent years due to the desire to improve the security of energy supply and to reduce CO 2 e emissions. This thesis aims to contribute to this policy debate, particularly by focussing on the issue of governmental support for infant energy technologies. In order to conduct this investigation, two main topics have been analysed. Firstly, learning curves have been studied to establish whether support for new technologies can be justified by the potential cost reductions which arise from learning-by-doing. This research evolved into the investigation of econometric issues which affect learning curves. Patent counts are used to demonstrate an alternative output-based measurement of industry wide knowledge stock, which is used as a proxy for innovation. This alternative specification of knowledge stock corroborates recent findings in the literature, that learning curves which model cost using only cumulative capacity leads to the over-estimation of cost reductions from learning-by-doing and the failure to capture cost reductions resulting from innovation. This suggests that government support for infant technologies should form a dual strategy of incentivising the deployment of generators as well as encouraging innovation, instead of using feed-in <b>tariffs</b> or renewable <b>obligations</b> which narrowly focus on increasing deployment. A great deal of progress has been made in identifying further econometric problems affecting learning curves in recent years. In the progress of this study, it was identified that cumulative capacity, the cost of wind power and knowledge stock are all non-stationary time series variables. The hypothesis that these variables are cointegrated was rejected by the Westerlund test, which implies that learning curves produce spurious results. This has major consequences for government policy as it suggests that learning curves should not be used to justify support for infant technologies. Secondly, a choice experiment was conducted to determine Scottish households’ willingness to pay for electricity generated from renewable sources compared to conventional sources such as coal, oil and gas. A labelled choice experiment was used to determine whether households have preferences between onshore wind power, offshore wind power and wave power. The results of a latent class model reveal that the majority of households (76. 5...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained papers related to renewable energy promotion. Paper I analyzes {{the factors that influence}} the share of renewable energy in total energy supply. The analysis is conducted using a panel data consisting of 26 OECD countries over the period 1990 - 2010. The results from the two-way fixed effect model indicate that policy measures play important roles in increasing the share of renewable energy. A positive effect of Research and Development (R&D) on the share of renewable energy is found, and this is because R&D activities have reduced the cost of renewable energy production. The results also indicate that having a market-based policy instrument (feed-in <b>tariffs</b> or quota <b>obligations)</b> in place increases the share of renewable energy in a country. However, {{there is no evidence to}} prefer a feed-in tariff or a quota obligation in this study. The individual effect of these policy instruments is not significant. This may issue from lack of powerful variables to measure their magnitudes. In addition, a large energy consumption growth decreases the share of renewable energy in total energy supply. Paper II elicits the value of renewable electricity that people are willing to pay to have their electricity supply come from exclusively renewable sources in six OECD countries. The results indicate that people are willing to pay only a few percentage points more of their current electricity bill in each country. This suggests that it is still difficult to extract a sizable premium for renewable electricity. Paper III investigates motivations for adoption of renewable electricity among households in Sweden. Different models are used to consider the possible interactions between adopting renewable electricity and joining environmental organizations. The results indicate that people's residences and most socio-demographic characteristics do not affect their adoption of renewable electricity. Adopters of renewable electricity tend to be males, members of environmental organizations, and those who strongly agree that people should pay for environmental policies. Environmental concern also affects adoption of renewable electricity, mainly via membership in an environmental organization. Paper IV investigates determinants of people's participation in environmental organizations in Sweden with a zero-inflated ordered probit (ZIOP) model. This model can account for different types of non-members, i. e. those who might become members in the future and those who are unlikely to become a member. The differentiation is based on a two-stage decision on participation. Results indicate that different factors influence people’s decision in the two stages, and a factor could have different effect in the two stages. Attitudes towards the environment play an important role. The component of non-members varies among households of different income levels. ...|$|R
40|$|Small {{hydropower}} facilities {{according to}} European Union (EU) standards have an installed capacity {{of less than}} 10 MW. The Renewable Energy Directive has set targets for installed capacity and electricity produced by small hydropower facilities to be reached before 2010. The European Water Framework Directive (EU WFD) has also set objectives; “good ecological quality” has to be reached before 2015. This directive can form restrictions for the introduction of small hydropower facilities. In this research, {{which is based on}} a literature study, the restrictions are made clear and the effects on reaching the targets are discussed. The research question is: Are there any restrictions within the EU WFD that limit the possibilities for small hydropower facilities and if so can the EU renewable energy targets for small hydropower facilities be met? Small hydropower is mainly run of the river; this means that there are no large reservoirs. Based on the height difference small hydropower facilities can be distinguished in high and low head facilities. There are four main types of small hydropower facilities. 1. 	Canal and Penstock (High head) 2. 	Penstock (High Head) 3. 	Mill Leat (Low Head) 4. 	Barrage (Low Head) In order to produce electricity a facility needs flowing water and a height difference. Based on the flow and head a specific turbine is used in the facility. These are impulse or reaction turbines. The investment costs differ per Member State, between 500 and 6, 000 Euro/kW installed capacity. The average investment costs in 14 Member States are between 2, 000 and 2, 500 Euro/kW. Positive developments are development of environmentally friendly technology and design, also the possibilities of Joint Implementation under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU WFD is a framework to protect the surface water bodies. It has as a purpose to prevent further deterioration and protect and enhance the status of aquatic ecosystems. Therefore “good ecological status and potential” are defined, respectively for rivers and artificial or heavily modified water bodies. The River Basin Management Plan is the main instrument to reach the “good status or potential” before 2015. This status or potential is based on the main quality elements: 1. 	Biological quality elements 2. 	Hydro morphological quality elements 3. 	Chemical and chemical physico quality elements The quality elements are further defined by 16 different descriptors. There are restrictions for small hydropower facilities, because on all 16 descriptors the “good quality” status has to be reached or maintained. In the Common Implementation Strategies (CIS) two biological descriptors are already mentioned on which small hydropower can have an environmental pressure. This will lead to further research which means that the installation costs and time will increase. The Renewable Energy Directive has the purpose to promote an increase in the contribution of renewable energy sources to electricity production. Because more renewable energy sources create a security of supply, reduce CO 2 emissions and create employment. Small hydropower targets have been set which have to be reached in 2010 : 55 TWh of electricity produced and 14 GW of installed capacity. To reach the targets four methods for promotion are used by the Members States: 1. 	Feed in <b>tariffs</b> 2. 	Quota <b>obligations</b> and Tradable green certificates 3. 	Fiscal and financial measures 4. 	Investment support The realised potential of small hydropower facilities was in 2003 11. 4 GW of installed capacity. And in 2002 38 TWh of electricity was produced by small hydropower facilities. The real potential for refurbishment is 1. 6 GW and for new facilities 7. 6 GW. If this real potential is realised more than 20. 5 GW of installed capacity can be reached, this is more than the set targets for 2010. The Energy Payback Time for small hydropower is site specific. Based on two facilities an indication can be given. The 3. 1 MW facility has an Energy Payback Time of 6. 7 months, the 0. 3 MW facility of 9. 3 months. The average efficiency of small hydropower facilities within the EU is 41 %. There are many similarities between both directives: target and objectives are set, deadlines exist, and methods to reach the target are published. Furthermore both directives stimulate positive environmental developments. The differences are the different timeframes, the targets set in the Renewable Energy Directive have to be reached by 2010, and the objectives set in the EU WFD by 2015. The targets in the Renewable Energy Directive are quantified, the objectives in the EU WFD at the moment not. But the main difference is that in the EU WFD small hydropower facilities are not recognised. The EU WFD proposes restrictions for small hydropower facilities. There is a difference in environmental pressures between high head and low head sites. Of the three main quality elements only the chemical and physico chemical quality elements experience few environmental pressures. On biological and hydro morphological quality elements small hydropower facilities have more environmental pressures. And these quality elements within the EU WFD restrict the development of small hydropower. However for each environmental pressure are mitigating options. The main option is good scheme design. Specific mitigating options are for the biological quality elements: fish ladders, fish bypass systems, fish screening and fish lifts. The possible future developments for small hydropower facilities are: 1. 	Recognition of small hydropower facilities in EU directives and regulations 2. 	Differentiation between high and low head sites 3. 	Certification of small hydropower facilities The conclusions are that theoretically an installed capacity of 20. 5 GW can be reached based on the total really available potential. Practically if only the really refurbishment potential is fulfilled, 13 GW can be reached. Refurbishment has to comply with the “good ecological potential”, the criteria to be met are less strict than for the “good ecological status”. New sites have to comply with “good ecological status”. This means that {{it is likely that the}} targets set in the Renewable Energy Directive will not be met, although there is enough real potential present to fulfil the target. The EU WFD poses therefore an extra restriction for small hydropower development This means that both EU directives are opposing each other on the topic of small hydropower. The EU WFD limits the development of small hydropower facilities and hinders the reaching of the targets given in the Renewable Energy Directive. The five recommendations for further research: 1. 	Differentiate between large and small hydropower within all EU directives and regulations 2. 	Investigate the possibilities of a CIS for renewable energy sources like small hydropower facilities 3. 	Investigate the possibilities of certification 4. 	Differentiate between high and low sites 5. 	Investigate the available potential...|$|R
