500|$|Relegation changed Gunn's {{mind about}} taking the Norwich job. He {{had decided not to}} {{continue}} in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, [...] "Relegation was a failure and I felt I couldn’t quit <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I had to do everything I could to put things right, if I was given the chance. And I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “When I saw {{the great}} White Chief I {{thought he was}} a great man. [...] When I heard him speak, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure he was a great man. [...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief. [...] If he were not both good and wise, so many young men of his nation would have never taken him for their leader.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A third, {{politically}} charged clip was later posted, with the titles [...] "Guess Who Batman" [...] and later [...] "Get with the Brogram", finally appearing as [...] "GWB". Despite both working titles sharing initials with George W. Bush, Allen wrote that [...] "this song {{is not a}} direct attack at anyone, it was originally written about the BNP in the UK but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> this issue has become relevant pretty much everywhere, we are the youth, we can make coolness for our future, its up to us. Go green and hate hate." [...] The song was retitled [...] "Fuck You" [...] for the album version. Allen posted a fourth song on her Myspace page, called [...] "Who'd of Known", noting that the song had been recorded for the album but would not be included due to legal issues since the chorus is musically similar to the Take That song [...] "Shine". However, Take That later did allow Allen to include the song on the album (now titled grammatically correctly as [...] "Who'd Have Known").|$|E
60|$|But {{the pain}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> a hundred times; {{it is with}} me as I write. It haunts this book, I see, that is what haunts this book, from end to end.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a quiver of my line, as if {{an electric}} current had animated it. I was shocked keen and thrilling. My line whipped up and ran out.|$|R
60|$|Work? I {{have never}} moved so lively before nor since, as <b>I</b> did <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{positive}} {{that within a}} very few seconds our deck would be swept by grape and cannister.|$|R
2500|$|While {{performing}} {{her song}} [...] "Human Nature" [...] in her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again. The Sun notes, [...] "Her actions {{may have been}} offensive to some members of her audience, as Turkey is a traditionally Islamic country, with a largely Muslim population" [...] before noting that [...] "Perhaps fans shouldn't have been surprised - as she did warn them, writing No Fear on her back. [...] Amy Odell from BuzzFeed said that criticizing the gesture based on her age sends [...] "a very archaic message", adding that [...] "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!". Three days later, The Sun published an article entitled, [...] "Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53." [...] Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna [...] "as a positive role model for older women." [...] While some initially claimed Madonna as [...] "clingy" [...] and [...] "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, [...] "I felt nervous when I pulled my bra down but that’s only natural— Madonna probably did too. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> empowered, {{it was an incredible}} feeling." [...] She goes on to say about Madonna, [...] "She looks incredible now— better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" [...] before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, [...] "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." [...] Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna [...] "will not change" [...] despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, [...] "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that [...] "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt pain, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> ire; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a {{determination}} to subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered {{them back to their}} source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thet put {{the crowd}} right an' nobody moved. Riggs turned green <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> almost <b>felt</b> sorry for him. He {{began to shake}} so he'd dropped a gun if he had pulled one.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Nettie slowly, while a faint flush {{crept into}} her face, “I did. Nobody was {{safe from the}} Sin Verguenza <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could trust him. There are men who make one feel like that, you know.” ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were in it}} now, for, as I had hoped, {{the horses}} {{followed}} the mare without hesitation. For the first twenty yards or so all went well, I heading up the stream. <b>Then</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that the mare was swimming.|$|R
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the door. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a sudden revulsion. I fell {{on my knees and}} seized her hands.|$|E
60|$|I was {{not dead}} to the {{stinging}} interrogation in the concluding sentence of Steele's speech. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure I had correctly judged Steele's motive. I began to {{warm to the}} situation.|$|E
60|$|A mist rose between Mrs. Creakle and me, and {{her figure}} {{seemed to move}} in it for an instant. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the burning tears run down my face, and it was steady again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see it all}} now; yes, I {{thought it}} {{singular}} <b>then,</b> though <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{there could be no}} impropriety in any of Mrs. Littlepage's acts. Dearest Martha! how well she played her part, and how admirably she has kept your secret!" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> {{like some}} watcher of the skiesWhen a new planet swims into his ken; ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not even <b>then,</b> Amy. Somehow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{sure that}} {{in the nick of}} time her lady friend would step out from somewhere and say that the letters were hers.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{no reason}} she should speak to you in that way. I must ask you to excuse me, but we could not help hearing, she was so loud, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> impelled to break in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He--he sort of {{degraded}} me. He {{wanted to}} bully {{me because he}} hadn't got me. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> as if I wanted to run, as if I was fastened and bound up. And he seemed dirty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It came again, {{that awful}} {{feeling as if}} {{something}} dreadful was going to happen. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself going." [...] She paused. [...] "Kirk, I think I know now. I understand; and oh, I'm so happy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well, I {{was talking}} just <b>then</b> of how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in those days. I {{was a boy}} <b>then,</b> you know. <b>I</b> dare say I could go back now to my old rooms and live there without a thrill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes Mrs Davidson and I {{would look}} at one another and the tears would stream down our cheeks. We worked without ceasing, day and night, and we seemed to make no progress. I don't know what I should have done without her <b>then.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my heart sink, when I was very near despair, she gave me courage and hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|I cannot {{pretend to}} {{describe}} what <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>felt.</b> <b>I</b> had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey {{an idea of the}} heart-sickening despair that <b>I</b> <b>then</b> endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. [...] "That evidence," [...] he observed, [...] "was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Die as if {{one should}} stab her with a knife. Some people don't believe in broken hearts," [...] I continued. [...] "I did n't till I knew Joscelind Bernardstone; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that she had one {{that would n't be}} proof." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had gone}} out on the little porch and stood gazing over the expanse of forest and waters lighted by the afterglow. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a hand upon my shoulder, I heard a {{familiar}} voice calling me by an old name.|$|E
60|$|Everything grew blurred {{before my}} eyes. I desperately fought for control over mind and muscle. I heard hoarse roars from Emett. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a hot, burning {{pain in my}} wrist, which stung all my faculties into keen life again.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Ratcliff {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with the Sun that she retrained as a counsellor, before retiring. She added that [...] "If you had asked me last year if I wanted to go back to acting I would have said no. I was working too hard <b>then</b> and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> tired. Now, <b>I</b> would say yes. If anyone needs someone to play a bag lady, I could do that." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not think}} these things clearly that afternoon. Much less did I ask how I, with my murderous purpose, stood to them all. I write down that {{realization}} of disorder and suffocation here and now as though I had thought it, but indeed <b>then</b> <b>I</b> only <b>felt</b> it, felt it transitorily as I looked back, and then stood with the thing escaping from my mind.|$|R
60|$|The barking of the {{vigilant}} dogs {{had drawn}} me instantly to the door, and I remember how positively certain <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>felt</b> that Sidney had kissed Mariposilla during her groundward journey.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a deep {{compassion}} for the gentleman's dejection, [...] For privation of affection would refrigerate a frog. [...] So I said: [...] "If nothing human, and if neither man nor woman [...] Can appreciate the fashion of your merit--buy a dog." ...|$|E
60|$|I stood swaying {{backward}} and forward for a moment, sick and dizzy with {{the horror of}} it. My eyes grew dim, and a mist seemed to fill the room. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself sink back into my lover's arms, and memory became a blank. I had fainted.|$|E
60|$|I was {{thoughtful}} for a moment. Perhaps, after all, I {{was inclined}} to envy my cousin. My own life was a simple and wholesome one enough, but it was far removed indeed {{from the world of}} great happenings. Just <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the first premonitions of dissatisfaction.|$|E
25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that the great Australian team was just {{beginning}} to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Laugh? Not one! They {{sat still}} as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know she did. I didn't envy her <b>then,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that {{millions}} of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification." [...] And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{inspiration}} {{comes from}} Chow's own childhood experience. [...] "I lived by sea at my young age and I {{looked at the}} sea everyday, thinking what are in there? I was frightened and curious. I was very nervous when I swam in the sea anytime and felt there would be something hid underneath. I was fascinated with the (mermaid) story since <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could do the film 6 years ago and started writing the script {{four or five years}} ago." ...|$|R
