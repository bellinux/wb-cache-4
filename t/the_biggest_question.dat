[...] Barnert also {{said it would be}} [...] "interesting" [...] to see whether [...] " [...] legion of fans from Port Charles will follow him to Genoa City." [...] Jill Farren Phelps developed a reputation and [...] "bad rap" [...] because she [...] "uses people" [...] according to Mark Pinter, an actor and friend of Phelps who had been hired by her to portray Marcus Wheeler on The Young and the Restless. Barnert noted that Burton is [...] "someone who has made his allegiance to Phelps clear" [...] which is why [...] "many fans" [...] had expected him to show up in Genoa City [...] "eventually". TV Guides Michael Logan had also weighed in on the rumors, calling Burton's [...] "willingness" [...] to work in Los Angeles after leaving General Hospital to live in Nashville a [...] "puzzler". Logan suggested that there could have been more to his decision to quit General Hospital. Stephen Nichols, who had portrayed Tucker McCall on The Young and the Restless for over three years, was fired that December. Logan said Phelps, who was [...] "under orders" [...] to trim the show's budget, may have fired Nichols in order to afford Burton in lieu of him.|$|E

50|$|The first {{hearing in}} Paris of the Pivardière case was on May 10, 1698. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>question</b> {{the defense had}} to answer was this: If Pivardière was still alive, why would he not come to Paris to {{exonerate}} his wife and the prior? Chauvelin and Charost's attorneys {{argued that it was}} because Pivardière feared an arrest for bigamy, a crime that was punishable by death in Old Regime France. They asserted that in 1695, Pivardière had taken the name Louis Dubouchet, moved to Auxerre, and married Marie-Elisabeth Pillard, the daughter of a deceased innkeeper. They further asserted that Pivardière had kept up fake correspondence with his first wife that gave the impression that he was still in the military. Upon his return to Narbonne on August 15, 1697, he discovered that Chauvelin suspected his infidelity and deemed it unwise to remain there.|$|E
