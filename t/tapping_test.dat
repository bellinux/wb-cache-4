40|$|Objective: To {{present an}} {{objective}} method to evaluate gait improvements after <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). <b>Tap</b> <b>test</b> {{is often used}} to prognosticate shunt responsiveness, although test accuracy is limited by the lack of quantitative outcome measures. Design: Retrospective analysis of gait data. Setting: Public tertiary care center, day hospital. Gait analysis was performed before and 2 - 4 hours after <b>tap</b> <b>test.</b> Participants: 60 iNPH patients and 50 age and sex matched controls (used to obtain reference intervals). From an initial referred sample of 79 patients, we excluded those unable to walk without walking aids (n = 9) or with incomplete (pre/post <b>tap</b> <b>test)</b> gait data (n= 10). Thirteen out of 60 patients were shunted and then reappraised after 6 months. Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Mahalanobis distance from controls, before and after <b>tap</b> <b>test.</b> Eleven gait parameters were combined in a single quantitative score. Walking velocity was also evaluated, since it is frequently used in <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> assessment. Results: Patients were classified as: (A) <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> responders (n= 22 patients, 9 of them were shunted), or (B) not suitable for shunt (n= 38 patients, 4 of them were shunted). In group A, 9 out of 9 patients improved after shunt. In group B, 3 out of 4 patients did not improve. Gait velocity increased after <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> in 53 % of responders and in 37 % of patients not suitable for shunt. Conclusions: The new method is applicable to the clinical practice and allows for selecting <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> responders in an objective way, quantifying the improvements.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} lumbar {{infusion}} {{test and the}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> for predicting the outcome of shunt surgery in patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus. METHODS: 68 patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus were studied. The absence of preceding history indicated idiopathic disease in 75 % of these. All patients were assessed twice with walking and psychometric tests before lumbar infusion <b>test</b> and <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> assessments. The lumbar infusion test was done using a constant infusion rate (0. 80 ml/min) and regarded as positive if the steady state CSF plateau pressure reached levels of > 22 mm Hg (resistance to outflow > 14 mm Hg/ml/min). The <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> was regarded as positive if {{two or more of}} four different test items improved after CSF removal. As the variability in baseline test results was large, the better of two evaluations was used in comparisons with the results after CSF removal, as well as to evaluate the outcome after shunt surgery. Only patients with a positive lumbar infusion test or a positive <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> had surgery. RESULTS: The results of the CSF <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> and the lumbar infusion test agreed in only 45 % of the patients. Of the total cohort, 47 (69 %) had positive test results and were operated on; 45 (96 %) of these reported subjective improvement, and postoperative assessments verified the improvements in 38 (81 %). Improvements were highly significant in walking, memory, and reaction time tests (p < 0. 001). Most of the patients improved by surgery (84 %) were selected by a positive lumbar infusion test, and only 42 % by a positive <b>tap</b> <b>test.</b> Positive predictive values were 80 % for lumbar infusion test and 94 % for <b>tap</b> <b>test.</b> The false negative predictions in the operated group were much higher (58 %) with the <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> than with the lumbar infusion test (16 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (NPH) is a {{cause of}} dementia that may be amended by medical intervention. Its diagnosis is therefore of major importance {{and the establishment of}} response criteria to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting is essential. One of these criteria is the clinical response to spinal tap. The accuracy of the spinal <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> could potentially be improved by adding neuroimaging of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes to the response criteria. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a voxel-based method of image analysis that may be used to statistically assess the significance of rCBF changes. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate, by SPM, spinal tap test-induced rCBF changes in patients with NPH syndrome. METHODS: Forty patients with NPH syndrome underwent hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after a spinal <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> (1 -day split-dose protocol). The differences in rCBF between these pairs of scans were analysed by SPM in the whole group and between subgroups divided according to gait improvement at the spinal <b>tap</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: In the whole group of patients, there was no statistical difference between pre- and post-spinal tap SPECT images. SPM analysis of patients grouped as a function of their clinical response to the spinal <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> revealed a significant post-spinal tap rCBF increase in the bilateral dorsolateral frontal and left mesiotemporal cortex in clinically responding compared with non-responding patients. CONCLUSION: According to SPM analysis, gait improvement at the spinal <b>tap</b> <b>test</b> in patients with NPH syndrome is associated with an rCBF increase localized in the bilateral dorsolateral frontal and left mesiotemporal cortex.

40|$|Background: Most clinicians rely on {{clinical}} scales {{such as the}} unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UDPRS) for evaluating parkinsonian patients and assessing their response to levodopa. Gait analysis is not commonly used, probably because of the equipment required and the time needed. Few data have been published on the relations between gait variables and measures of arm and hand mobility. Objectives: To evaluate the correlation between dopa induced gait improvement and upper limb motor improvement using a rapid and simple method; and to evaluate the correlation between gait improvement and UPDRS III improvement. Methods: A finger <b>tapping</b> <b>test</b> and a simple walking test were {{used to measure the}} OFF-ON variations of upper limb motor function and gait in 23 patients with Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS motor score and the Hoehn and Yahr stage were measured in the OFF and the ON state. Results: There was no correlation between OFF-ON variation of the number of hits with the finger <b>tapping</b> <b>test</b> and OFF-ON variation in the gait variables. OFF-ON variation in the UPDRS motor score was not correlated with OFF-ON variation in the gait variables. Conclusions: There was a dissociation between the effect of levodopa on upper limb and gait.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate if exergames targeting the UE improve arm and hand activities and impairments and to establish the acceptability and feasibility of these games in people with PD. Methods Two tablet-based exergames were developed which were controlled with finger movements or unimanual whole arm movements. Participants with PD were randomized to an exergame (n = 19) or control (n = 19) group. The exergame group performed UE exergames at home, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the nine hole peg test. Secondary outcomes included measures of UE activities and impairments, including the <b>tapping</b> <b>test</b> [speed (taps/ 60 s), and error (weighted error score/speed) ]. Results There were no between group differences in the nine hole peg test, or in any secondary outcome measures except for the <b>tapping</b> <b>test.</b> Horizontal <b>tapping</b> <b>test</b> results showed that exergame participants improved their speed (mean difference = 10. 9 taps/ 60 s, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) but increased error (mean difference = 0. 03, p = 0. 03) compared to the control group. Participants enjoyed the games and improved in their ability to play the games. There were no adverse events. Conclusion The UE exergames were acceptable and safe, but did not translate to improvement in functional activities. It is likely that the requirement of the games resulted in increased movement speed at the detriment of accuracy. The design of exergames should consider task specificity...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal-pressure {{hydrocephalus}} (iNPH) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome {{characterized by}} the clinical triad of gait disturbance, urinary dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. The aim {{of the present study}} was to find specific EEG patterns associated with shunt response in iNPH. METHODS: Twenty five iNPH patients (10 shunt responders and 15 non-responders) were enrolled in this study. We performed current source density (CSD) analysis in several frequency bands (delta: 2 - 4 Hz, theta: 4 - 8 Hz, alpha: 8 - 13 Hz, beta: 13 - 30 Hz, gamma: 30 - 60 Hz) using exact Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA). CSD distribution was compared between shunt responders and non-responders for each frequency band before and after CSF <b>tap</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: Shunt responders showed increased gamma CSD in the left temporal cortex before CSF tapping relative to non-responders. However, after CSF tapping, shunt response was associated with significantly higher CSDs in several frequency bands, specifically theta, alpha, beta and gamma, involving mainly the frontal and temporal areas.
