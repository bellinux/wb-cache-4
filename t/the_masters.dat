5|$|Despite Grey Worm and Missandei's objections, Tyrion Lannister {{arranges}} {{a diplomatic}} meeting with <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis. He proposes a deal allowing the cities {{seven years to}} transition away from slavery, while compensating <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> for any losses. In return, <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> will cease their support of the Sons of the Harpy. As <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> deliberate, Tyrion is confronted by the former slaves of Meereen, who oppose any kind of negotiation with <b>the</b> <b>masters.</b> Grey Worm and Missandei reluctantly support Tyrion, but in private they warn him that <b>the</b> <b>masters,</b> whom they are both familiar with, will use him if he tries to use them.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Masters</b> Tournament, {{also known}} as <b>The</b> <b>Masters</b> or The US Masters, {{is one of the}} four major championships in {{professional}} golf.

5|$|A {{husband and}} wife who had lost their son {{as a result of}} the war offered {{themselves}} as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian of the Towers. Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.|$|E

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.
