The attribution of the quote to Karadžić is a common misconception in Serbia, Montenegro and the rest of former Yugoslavia.

40|$|This thesis argues <b>that</b> <b>principles</b> {{provide a}} {{framework}} which helps to ensure that human factors and systems engineering are integrated at all stages of development. The argument ranges from the fundamental problems of control, {{to the problems of}} a development architecture, to the problems of designing a particular interface. Part I of this thesis justifies an attempt to use principles as a means of integrating human factors and systems engineering. Part II argues <b>that</b> <b>principles</b> provide common objectives for the human factors and systems engineering of interactive control systems. They provide criteria against which to assess the utility of potential solutions for problems that are common to many different interfaces: dynamism; complexity and openness. Interval temporal logic is proposed as an appropriate notation in which to represent these solutions. Part III argues <b>that</b> <b>principles</b> provide criteria against which to assess the util-ity of architectures for human factors and systems engineering.

25|$|The book {{begins with}} an {{extensive}} review of many topics {{in the history of}} ideas the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe <b>that</b> <b>principle</b> has important antecedents in the notions of teleology and intelligent design. They discuss the writings of Fichte, Hegel, Bergson, and Alfred North Whitehead, and the Omega Point cosmology of Teilhard de Chardin. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish teleological reasoning from eutaxiological reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.|$|E
25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>principle</b> is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.|$|E
