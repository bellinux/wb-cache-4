5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> see if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells {{her that he had}} seen Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The fastidious little mouse {{spends a}} {{fortnight}} spring cleaning. She rubs the furniture with beeswax and polishes her little tin spoons, then holds {{a party for}} five other little wood-mice wearing their Regency finery. Mr. Jackson attends but is forced to sit outside because Mrs. Tittlemouse has narrowed her door. He takes no offence at being excluded from the parlour. Acorn-cupfuls of honeydew are passed through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> him and he toasts Mrs. Tittlemouse's good health.|$|E

5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.|$|E
5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E

5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
25|$|The armored forces {{made several}} failed {{attempts}} {{to break through}} to the building. When one force approached, they threw furniture out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> signal their location, but the vehicles' hatches were closed and drove pass the building, all the while under small arms fire. The armored force noticed another paratroop group, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel Yaakov Hisdai, with eighty men, most of them wounded, which followed Yoffe's battalion. All but sixty men were rescued.|$|E
25|$|The central chancel east {{window is}} of five lights, {{separated}} by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoilslobes {{formed by the}} overlapping of five circlesand spandrels. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is clear glazed. All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, clear glazed, and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two Tudor windows, both wider than high. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> the east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched cinquefoil heads, and is clear glazed. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> the west is of five lights, again with arched cinquefoil heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch door opening with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.|$|E
50|$|<b>To</b> tile <b>windows,</b> <b>the</b> user selects {{them in the}} taskbar {{and uses}} the context menu choice Tile Vertically or Tile Horizontally. However, the wording of these options is misleading. Choosing Tile Vertically will cause <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> tile {{horizontally}} but take on a vertical shape, while choosing Tile Horizontally will cause <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> tile vertically but take on a horizontal shape. These options were later changed in <b>Windows</b> Vista <b>to</b> Show <b>Windows</b> Side by Side and Show Windows Stacked, respectively. <b>Windows</b> 7 adds <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> drag <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> {{either side of the}} screen to create a simple side-by-side tiled layout, or {{to the top of the}} screen to maximize.|$|R

25|$|Ireland, angered {{that he had}} {{received}} no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days. He met and courted 33-year-old Andrew Collier, a housing warden, and the pair went to Collier's home in Dalston. After entering the flat there was a disturbance outside and both men went to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> investigate. Ireland gripped a horizontal metal bar that ran across the window. He later forgot to wipe the bar for fingerprints during his usual cleanup phase. The police found these prints.|$|E

As police sirens approach, Rupert pulls up a chair next to the chest and the film's end credits appear on the screen.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Copyright Act of 1976 in its {{original}} form, only the spouse, children, or grandchildren of a dead author could terminate a grant of copyright. This had prevented Shuster's sister and nephew from terminating Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman in the years following his death. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act modified the law to allow executors of estates to terminate. Under the original law, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> serve the termination notice had ended in 1997, but the Sonny Bono Act also added a new subsection allowing the Shuster heirs to terminate 75 to 80 years after the copyright was first secured (with the usual two- to ten-year advance notice). The Shuster heirs could terminate their grant between 2013 and 2018, and the termination notice would have to be served between 2003 and 2016. On November 7, 2003, Peary served DC Comics with a notice of termination of Shuster's grant of the rights to Superman. He assigned Shuster's half of the rights to Superman to Pacific Pictures.|$|E
25|$|The building’s {{interior}} is distributed across three floors: a basement floor, {{which includes the}} kitchen, pantry and service areas; a ground floor including all the living rooms, dining rooms, atriums and library; and a first-floor which corresponds to the private quarters. Visitors entering the Villa through the main entrance from the street, that is relatively dark, will gain their first impression of the building’s structure and {{its relationship with the}} garden, from the impressive two-storey central hall. Looking in front, through the vast exterior window, they will see the central parterre and park. Looking to the right, they will see the vast salon which extends via <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> the lateral parterre. The Villa’s private quarters can be sensed rather than seen, via the first floor gallery around the central atrium. To the left, with a slight difference of floor levels, there is an elegant dining room that overlooks the garden and a billiards room, on the other side, that looks over the street. Beyond them we see a wrought iron gate designed by Edgar Brandt, which separates this social zone from the Villa’s private quarters on the first floor and also the library and service areas on the ground floor.|$|E

Entitled [...] "Another Jubilee Suggestion", Watts proposed to [...] "collect a complete record of the stories of heroism in every-day life". Watts cited the case of Alice Ayres, a servant who, trapped in a burning house, gave up the chance to jump to safety, instead first throwing a mattress out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> cushion the fall, before running {{back into the house}} three times to fetch her employer's children and throwing them out of a window onto the mattress to safety before herself being overcome by fumes and falling out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> her death.|$|E
