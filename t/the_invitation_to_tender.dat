40|$|For {{some years}} now {{the number of}} all-day schools {{providing}} school meals in the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany, has increased continuously. This paper aims at analysing the political determinants {{and the organization of}} the provision of school meals in Lower Saxony with a special focus on the provision of organic food and sustainability. As to methods, literature was researched and internet sources were evaluated. In addition, interviews with experts in the field contributed to the findings. The results show heterogeneous approaches to and different forms of the organization of school meal supply. School boards, as the chief agents of provision, seem to enjoy a high degree of organizational freedom. Due to small budgets, time constraints and lack of experience, the quality of the meals provided may suffer and the range of organic products may be affected. It often results in pragmatic solutions dictated by cost saving. With respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>tenders,</b> existing quality standards have not been made legally binding for commercial food suppliers to date. Neither is the quality of school meals of particular significance for school inspections. Stakeholders of school meal provision receive support from the Consumer Council of Lower Saxony (Verbraucherzentrale Niedersachsen) and the Coordination Centre for School Food of Lower Saxony (Vernetzungsstelle Schulverpflegung Niedersachsen). The latter opened in spring 2009. A series of workshops within the public campaign "Anyone can go organic" (Bio kann jeder) run by the Hanover Centre of Environment (Umweltzentrum Hannover) provides advice and/or initial training to schools and school boards concerning the use of organic food...|$|R

25|$|By 2009, {{suggestions}} of a rivalry between Modi and N. Srinivasan surfaced. During 2009‚Äì10, Lalit Modi oversaw the bidding process for induction {{of two new}} teams in the Indian Premier League. In December 2009, he inserted two new clauses in <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>tender</b> (ITT): the bidder should have a net worth of at least USD 1 billion and must provide a bank guarantee of USD 100 million. Modi stated that these clauses protected BCCI's interests. However, other BCCI board members claimed that he was rigging bids to suit Adani Group and Videocon Group, as the new clauses would rule {{out most of the}} other prospective bidders. After the ITT was floated on 22 February 2010, some of the prospective bidders, including Sahara Group and Jagran Group, complained to the BCCI President Shashank Manohar that they were being deliberately kept out of the tendering process. After receiving only two bids, IPL changed the ITT, removing the net worth clause and reducing the guarantee amount to USD 10 million.|$|E

40|$|For the {{development}} of the first manned mission to Mars, thousands of industrial contractors, universities, and research institutions will need to work closely together. Impor-tant project data, such as project progress, performance, deadlines, costs and cash flows, will need to be transferred between contractors and their subcontractors. The technical imple-mentation of these interfaces will be quite challenging, because the project participants often use different project management software. This makes the automatic integration of data much more difficult. As a result, costly and time-consuming manual integration is usually necessary. In order to alleviate this problem, the European Space Agency (ESA) requires all contractors to use the same software: ECOS (ESA Costing Software). With ECOS, <b>the</b> elec-tronic <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>tender</b> can be distributed electronically by the contracting agencies. Sub-contractors send their proposal bid data electronically to the next higher contractor, who can then integrate these data in their proposal bid automatically. Other software packages have extended this philosophy to include completion of all phases of the entire project. The disad-vantage of this method is, that one particular contractor could be forced by each of their dif-ferent customers to use a special software package for project management. WB-B 2 B (Web-Based-Business-to-Business) is a software system, which solves the conflict between internal and external integration. This tool integrates all project data over the entire project life cycle across enterprise boundaries and over multiple hardware and software platforms by using the Internet. Both the call for proposals as well as the develop-ment of proposal bids on each contractual level can be conducted over a B 2 B platform. Fur-thermore, the e-procurement interface makes it possible to connect to already existing virtual B 2 B market places. In this paper, WB-B 2 B and its possible application in an international Mars mission will be presented in detail. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The formal {{approach}} of English courts is that agreement exists when an offer is mirrored by an unequivocal {{acceptance of the}} terms on offer. Whether an offer has been made, or it has been accepted, is an issue courts determine by asking what a reasonable person would have thought was intended. Offers are distinguished from [...] "invitations to treat" [...] (or an invitatio ad offerendum, <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> of an offer) which cannot be simply accepted by the other party. Traditionally, English law has viewed the display of goods in a shop, even with a price tag, as an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat, so that when a customer takes the product to the till it is she who is making the offer, and the shopkeeper may refuse to sell. Similarly, and as a very general rule, an advertisement, <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> make a bid at an auction with a reserve price, or <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> submit a <b>tender</b> bid are not considered offers. On the other hand, a person inviting tenders may fall under a duty to consider the submissions if they arrive before the deadline, so the bidder (even {{though there is no}} contract) could sue for damages if his bid is never considered. An auctioneer who publicises an auction as being without a reserve price falls under a duty to accept the highest bid. An automated vending machine constitutes a standing offer, and a court may construe an advertisement, or something on display like a deckchair, to be a serious offer if a customer would be led to believe they were accepting its terms by performing an action. Statute imposes criminal penalties for businesses that engage in misleading advertising, or not selling products at the prices they display in store, or unlawfully discriminating against customers on grounds of race, gender, sexuality, disability, belief or age. The Principles of European Contract Law article 2:201 suggests that most EU member states count a proposal to supply any good or service by a professional as an offer.|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the labor and rail franchising policy of the British Labor Government. In opposition, the Labor Party initially opposed rail privatization on principle. By 1997, however, its approach was that privatization {{could be made to}} work given stronger regulation and an element of strategic leadership. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) was created to provide strategic direction for the rail industry and, after its absorption of the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising in 1999, it also became responsible for the regulation of the 25 Train Operating Companies. Government efforts to improve rail performance through the franchising system have proved to be problematic. The reasons for this include a complex but ineffective system of incentives and fines, the poor performance of the infrastructure authority and difficulties in bringing new rolling stock into service. Given these problems, the ultimate regulatory sanction is to terminate a poorly-performing train operating companies' franchise. This has happened once so far, when in 2003 Connex South East's franchise was removed and passed to a new public sector company, South Eastern Trains, a subsidiary of the SRA. The performance of South Eastern Trains has improved for four successive quarters. Despite the substantial improvements made by the public sector company, in January 2005 <b>the</b> SRA issued <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>tender</b> for <b>the</b> new Integrated Kent franchise covering services from Kent and East Sussex. There are several grounds for keeping South Eastern Trains within the public sector. The company has succeeded in improving performance, and so has complied with the what works principle. Another argument for maintaining at least one franchise in the public sector is that it could provide the basis for a gradual integration of the rail networ...|$|R
