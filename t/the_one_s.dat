The LTE-capable One X shares much of its hardware with <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>S,</b> including the dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 MSM8960 SoC. The One X's S-LCD 2 is considered superior to the One S's Super AMOLED Pentile display and the One X (Snapdragon S4 variant, not the Tegra 3) includes an LTE-capable modem that <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>S</b> lacks; however <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>S</b> has better battery life and a form factor that is easier to hold.http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/05/htc-one-x-vs-one-s/ ...|$|E
50|$|Slotted {{between the}} low-end HTC One V and the {{high-end}} HTC One X in the HTC One lineup, the One S's specs and positioning {{are close to}} that of the flagship One X. <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>S</b> and One X sold in North America share the same dual-core processor, though <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>S</b> lacks LTE. <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>S</b> has an aluminum body and a 4.3-inch 960x 540 pixel (qHD) Super AMOLED display with PenTile matrix with a pixel density of 256 pixels per inch, compared to the One X's polycarbonate body and a 4.7 in 1,280x720 pixel (RGB matrix) Super LCD 2 display with a pixel density of 312 pixels per inch.|$|E

The phone provides 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of built-in storage; however, the phone lacks a microSD slot for additional storage.|$|E
50|$|The One S's {{use of a}} PenTile display {{makes it}} more energy {{efficient}} and thinner than equivalent LCD screens, giving it better battery life than the One X. While their rear-facing cameras use identical 8-megapixel sensors, for the front-facing camera <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>S</b> has a VGA cam and video capture fixed at 640 x 480 resolution compared to the One X's 1.3-megapixel sensor with 720p HD video capture.

50|$|Main-group {{elements}} {{in the third and}} later rows of the periodic table can form hypercoordinate or hypervalent molecules in which the central main-group atom is bonded to more than four other atoms, such as phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, and sulfur hexafluoride, SF6. For example, in PCl5, if it is supposed that there are five true covalent bonds in which five distinct electron pairs are shared, then the phosphorus would be surrounded by 10 valence electrons in violation of the octet rule. In the early days of quantum mechanics, Pauling proposed that third-row atoms can form five bonds by using one s, three p and one d orbitals, or six bonds by using one s, three p and two d orbitals. To form five bonds, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>s,</b> three p and one d orbitals combine to form five sp3d hybrid orbitals which each share an electron pair with a halogen atom, for a total of 10 shared electrons, two more than the octet rule predicts. Similarly to form six bonds, the six sp3d2 hybrid orbitals form six bonds with 12 shared electrons. In this model the availability of empty d orbitals is used to explain the fact that third-row atoms such as phosphorus and sulfur can form more than four covalent bonds, whereas second-row atoms such as nitrogen and oxygen are strictly limited by the octet rule.|$|E

The matching algorithm which compares two sets of maxima and assigns a matching value as a measure of similarity is presented in this paper. The method is robust with respect to noise, scale and orientation changes of objects. It is also capable to retrieve objects which are similar to the mirror-image of the input boundary. We introduce the aspect ratio of the CSS image as a new parameter which can be used for indexing in conjunction with other parameters like eccentricity and circularity. T [...] ...|$|E
