500|$|Friction {{with the}} provincial {{government}} rose notably when, in October 1771, Allen and a company of Boys drove off a group of Scottish settlers near Rupert. Allen detained two of the settlers and forced them to watch the torching of their newly constructed cabins. He then ordered them to leave, saying, [...] "Go your way now, and complain to <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> scoundrel your Governor, God damn your Governor, Laws, King, Council, and Assembly". [...] When the settlers protested his language Allen continued the tirade, threatening to send any troops from New York to Hell. In response, New York's governor, William Tryon, issued warrants for the arrests of those responsible, and eventually put a price of £20 on the heads of six participants, including Allen. Allen and his comrades countered by issuing offers of their own.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1805, after {{completing}} a small refit of his ship in Portsmouth, Captain Harvey was superseded {{in command of}} Agamemnon by Captain Sir Edward Berry, who had previously commanded Nelson's flagship, , at the Battle of the Nile. On 3 October she departed Spithead to join Vice-Admiral Nelson's fleet blockading Villeneuve's combined fleet in Cádiz. En route, Agamemnon fell in with a French squadron, consisting of six ships {{of the line and}} several smaller vessels, which gave chase. Succeeding in evading the French, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron on 13 October, and when Nelson laid eyes on the approaching ship he reportedly exclaimed: [...] "Here comes <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> fool Berry! Now we shall have a battle!" [...] In misty conditions on 20 October, Agamemnon captured a large American merchant brig, which she then took in tow. Not long after, [...] signalled to Agamemnon that she was sailing straight towards an enemy fleet of 30 ships—Villeneuve's fleet had left port.|$|E

500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Bond {{had made}} him a star, Connery {{eventually}} grew tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying [...] " [...] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit" [...] and [...] "I have always hated <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> James Bond. I'd like to kill him". Michael Caine said of the situation, [...] "If you were his friend in these early days you didn't raise the subject of Bond. He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond. He'd be {{walking down the street}} and people would say, [...] "Look, there's James Bond." [...] That was particularly upsetting to him." ...|$|E
50|$|Clattenburg's {{jump from}} music to {{television}} began with his co-hosting {{and production of}} a Halifax Cable 10 show, <b>That</b> <b>Damn</b> Cable Show, from 1990 to 1993. The program featured on-location interviews and profiles of Halifax entertainers, {{many of whom were}} acquaintances of Clattenburg's through his band contacts. Wedged in between the entertainer segments were comedic three-minute clips that displayed his early talent for irreverent film making. <b>That</b> <b>Damn</b> Cable Show was remarkable for its high production values despite being a local cable channel production on a shoestring budget, and made an early name for Clattenburg in film production circles.|$|R

2500|$|In {{frustration}} U.S. Commander Zachary Taylor, {{referring to}} the Saint Patrick's Battalion, ordered a squadron of the 1st Dragoons to [...] "take <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> battery". In this task they failed, and, badly bloodied, were forced to retreat. At about 1 p.m. the San Patricios covered a Mexican retreat as a disordered mass of infantry sought refuge during a lull in the fighting. The San Patricios rode out the day in a costly artillery duel with several American batteries, which killed and injured roughly one third of them. General Francisco Mejia’s Battle Report for Buena Vista described the San Patricios’ as “worthy of the most consummate praise because the men fought with daring bravery." [...] Several Irishmen were awarded the War Cross by the Mexican government for their conduct in that battle, and many received field promotions.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1953, Jackson {{suffered}} a heart attack, {{as a result of}} which directing animator Eric Larson of Disney's Nine Old Men took over as director. By April 1954, Sleeping Beauty was scheduled for a February 1957 release. With Larson as the director, Disney instructed Larson, whose unit would animate the forest sequence, that the picture was to be a [...] "moving illustration, the ultimate in animation" [...] and added that he did not care how long it would take. Because of the delays, the release date was again pushed back from Christmas 1957 to Christmas 1958. Fellow Nine Old Men Milt Kahl would blame Walt for the numerous release delays because [...] "he wouldn’t have story meetings. He wouldn't get the damn thing moving." [...] Relatively late in production, Disney removed Larson as the supervising director and replaced him with Clyde Geronimi. Directing animator Wolfgang Reitherman would join Geronimi as sequence director over the climactic dragon battle sequence commenting that [...] "We took the approach {{that we were going to}} kill <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> prince!". Les Clark, another member of the Nine Old Men, would serve as the sequence director of the elaborate opening scene where crowds of the citizens in the kingdom arrive at the palace for the presentation of Princess Aurora.|$|E
2500|$|Q1 is {{considered}} a 'good text' (i.e. not a bad quarto or a reported text), and it forms the basis for most modern editions of the play. Q2 appears {{to be based on}} a damaged copy of Q1, as it is missing a number of lines which are replaced by what appear to be guess work {{on the part of the}} compositor. This is especially noticeable at the end of the play where four lines of dialogue have been added to Lucius' closing speech; [...] "See justice done on Aaron, <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> Moor,/By whom our heavy haps had their beginning;/Then afterwards to order well the state,/That like events may ne'er it ruinate." [...] Scholars tend to assume that when the compositor got to the last page and saw the damage, he presumed some lines were missing, when in fact none were. Q2 was considered the control text until 1904, when the copy of Q1 now at the Folger Shakespeare Library was discovered in Sweden. Together with a 1594 printing of Henry VI, Part I, the Folger's Q1 Titus is the earliest extant printed Shakespearean play. Q2 also corrects a number of minor errors in Q1. Q3 is a further degradation of Q2, and includes a number of corrections to the Q2 text, but introduces many more errors.|$|E

2500|$|The insatiable {{demand for}} {{manpower}} for the Western Front had been foreseen early on. A volunteer system {{had been introduced}} at the outbreak of war, and Asquith was reluctant to change it for political reasons, as many Liberals, {{and almost all of}} their Irish Nationalist and Labour allies, were strongly opposed to conscription. Volunteer numbers dropped, not meeting the demands for more troops for Gallipoli, and much more strongly, for the Western Front. This made the voluntary system increasingly untenable; Asquith's daughter Violet wrote in March 1915; [...] "Gradually every man with the average number of limbs and faculties is being sucked out to the war." [...] In July 1915, the National Registration Act was passed, requiring compulsory registration for all men between the ages of 18 and 65. This was seen by many as the prelude to conscription but the appointment of Lord Derby as Director-General of Recruiting instead saw an attempt to rejuvenate the voluntary system, the Derby Scheme. Asquith's slow steps towards conscription continued to infuriate his opponents, Sir Henry Wilson writing to Leo Amery; [...] "What {{is going to be the}} result of these debates? Will 'wait and see' win, or can that part of the Cabinet that is in earnest and is honest force <b>that</b> <b>damned</b> old Squiff into action?" [...] The Prime Minister's balancing act, within Parliament and within his own party, was not assisted by a strident campaign against conscription conducted by his wife. Describing herself as [...] "passionately against it", Margot Asquith engaged in one of her frequent influencing drives, by letters and through conversations, which had little impact other than doing [...] "great harm" [...] to Asquith's reputation and position.|$|E
