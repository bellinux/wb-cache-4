5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater {{to the needs of}} gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Maggie spells EMCSQU with her blocks, a {{reference}} to Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation. A picture of Einstein also appears {{on the wall of}} Dr. Pryor's office. At one point Homer erroneously refers to Einstein as the inventor of the light bulb. Dr. Pryor compares Bart's proposed work among ordinary children to Jane Goodall's study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned in the episode, sending the program a letter, and Vitti an autographed copy of her book. The conductor of the opera the family attends is named Boris Csupowski, {{a reference to}} animator Gabor Csupo. The opera attended by the family is Carmen, by French composer Georges Bizet; the song that Bart mocks is a famous aria called the Toreador Song. Students at <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> school have lunchboxes that feature images of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> term intellectually <b>gifted</b> rural-to-urban migrant {{children}} {{refers to}} intellectually gifted {{children who are}} in migration from rural to urban areas. We compared performances on seven attention tasks among intellectually gifted (n= 26) and average (n= 30) rural-to-urban migrant and intellectually gifted urban children (n= 31). Our results showed that intellectually gifted rural-to-urban migrant children performed more correctly and faster on some attention tasks than did the intellectually average rural-to-urban migrant children, {{but they did not}} perform as well on some attention tasks as did <b>the</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> urban children. Based on the attentional structures, it was evident <b>the</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> rural-to-urban migrant children developed more mature than did either <b>the</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> urban or <b>the</b> intellectually average rural-to-urban migrant children. This suggests <b>the</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> rural-to-urban migrant children&# 39;s attention is overall superior to that of their intellectually average peers. However, there are advantages and disadvantages in terms of the quality of their attention compared to <b>the</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> urban children. While their attentional structures seem to develop earlier, their accuracy on some of the attention tasks seems to suffer. This suggests that rural-to-urban migration is a double-edged sword for intellectually gifted children. </p...|$|R
5|$|The Avery Coonley School (ACS), {{commonly}} called Avery Coonley, is an independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in preschool through eighth grade (approximately ages 3 to 14), and {{is located in}} Downers Grove, Illinois. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of <b>the</b> <b>gifted.</b>|$|E

The GEP is offered at selected schools, meaning that these pupils attend school alongside their peers in the mainstream curriculum but attend separate classes for certain subjects. As of the 2016 academic year, there are 9 primary schools which offer the GEP.|$|E

In 200 BC, alarmed at the ease with which he was ravaging their territory, the Achaeans asked the Macedonian King Philip V for help, which he did not provide. In the following years, Nabis was able to skilfully exploit the conflict between Philip and the Romans, gaining control of the important city of Argos as the price of his alliance with the Macedonians, and then defecting to the soon to be victorious Romans so that he might hold on to his conquest.|$|E
