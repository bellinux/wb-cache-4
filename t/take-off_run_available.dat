50|$|With {{certification}} complete, the Air Ministry {{took the}} C.860 to Istres {{to determine the}} <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> required with the heavy fuel load needed to achieve the desired long range. A 24.5 hour flight at 290 km/h, covering 7100 km, consumed 1340 L of petrol and 80 L of oil. The resulting take-off weight of 2300 kg, required a <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of 650 m, well within the Air Ministry's 1000 m specification limit.|$|R

50|$|Production {{examples}} of the Pioneer CC.1 were fitted with full-span controlled leading-edge wing slats and large-area Fowler-type trailing edge flaps, giving a <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of 225 feet and a landing run of only 200 feet.|$|R
25|$|The Air Yacht {{made its}} first flight in February 1930 at Hythe, England. It proved to be underpowered, with an {{excessive}} <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> and despite re-engining with three Armstrong Siddeley Panthers, was rejected by Guinness, who purchased a Saro Cloud instead.|$|R

25|$|The DF 2000 was {{designed}} to provide a fast, robust, comfortable, low-cost side-by-side two-seat ultralight with a short <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b> It has a conventional layout not unlike that of, for example, the Cessna 152, with a high wing, swept vertical tail and tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 October 1951, an Air Algérie Sud-Ouest Bretagne (registered F-OAIY) {{caught fire}} and was {{subsequently}} destroyed at Paris-Orly Airport, following the sudden {{collapse of the}} right main landing gear during <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b> All 30 passengers and 4 crew members on board could be saved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} day, sea level, no wind, {{take off}} on land with a [...] engine is 122 m and the landing roll is 145 m. On the water the <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> is 250 m and the landing run is 189 m {{for the two}} place version.|$|R
50|$|On 31 December 1997, an AeroSur Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner (registered CP-2321) was {{substantially}} damaged when it {{veered off}} the runway at Teniente Jorge Henrich Arauz Airport. The two pilots had {{lost control of}} the aircraft during <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b> There were no notable injuries amongst the 18 passengers on board.|$|R
25|$|On 28 August 1992, a Bouraq Vickers Viscount (registered PH-IVX) was {{destroyed}} in an engine fire at Syamsudin Noor Airport. The fire started during the <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> but the pilots noticed it in time to abort take-off and evacuate the 64 passengers (plus six crew), before the aircraft was engulfed by the flames.|$|R
50|$|The RW19 is a 75% scale {{replica of}} the Fieseler Storch Second World War German liaison aircraft. The RW19 is noted for its STOL performance, equal to or better {{than that of the}} {{original}} Storch. The claimed <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> and landing roll are 30 ft due to a 15 mph stall speed.|$|R

25|$|On 31 October 1983, Douglas DC-3C N44896 of FBN Flying Service was {{destroyed}} by fire at Laredo International Airport while attempting to take-off on a cargo flight to McAllen-Miller International Airport, Texas. A fire had developed on board the aircraft during the <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> and the crew were unable to extinguish it with the equipment available to them.|$|R
2500|$|In {{operational}} use the Nelson powerplant proved {{heavy and}} lacking in power and, as the Sailplane Directory terms it, [...] "the result was an under-powered sailplane". The [...] engine gave the Dragonfly a sea level climb rate of just 235 fpm (1.19m/s) and a <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of [...] As {{a result of the}} performance deficiencies only seven were produced.|$|R
50|$|However, a {{detailed}} evaluation in the Aviation Technical Research Institute (ITBL) showed, that the 'PWS.5t2' {{had a long}} <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> poor handling in the glide at slow speed and low ceiling due {{to the use of}} an inadequate Wright propeller. Other competitors: the PZL Ł.2 and Lublin R-X were evaluated, with better results, so no more PWS-5s were ordered.|$|R
50|$|As an example, the Slepcev Storch is a ¾ scale {{reproduction}} of the original with some simplifications. The use of modern materials provides better STOL performance than the original with a <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of 30 m and landing-roll of 50 m with no headwind. It was originally designed and manufactured in Australia and is now manufactured in Serbia.|$|R

50|$|The D2 was {{primarily}} an autogyro {{driven by a}} pusher configuration, shrouded propeller whilst supported by an autorotatiing undriven two blade rotor. It was unusual in that the rotor could be powered, by the same engine that drove the propeller, during a vertical take-off phase to overcome the autogyro's normal limiting need for a <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{parked at the}} Queensland Airlines terminal for {{about a quarter of}} an hour before departing at 11:15am local time. [...] On board were 16 adult passengers and 2 infants, 2 pilots and an air hostess. [...] All passenger seats were occupied. Observers saw the aircraft taxi to the end of the strip, turn around and promptly commence its <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initial {{flight tests}} showed good {{performance}} from the wing design {{with a short}} <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of 75 m and low stall speed. Further tests revealed limited roll authority leading to the change from ailerons to wing warping. The S-11 won second place in a reconnaissance aircraft competition hosted by the Russian military in 1913, but no orders were ever placed for additional examples.|$|R
50|$|The next {{generation}} Yak-12 entered production in 1952, {{starting with the}} Yak-12R. It was fitted with a new 194 kW (260 hp) Ivchenko AI-14R radial and all-metal construction. The wing area increased (from 21.6 m² to 23.8 m²). This variant had the least wing loading of all Yak-12s, and therefore best STOL performance (<b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> 52 m/171 ft, landing 81 m/266 ft).|$|R
5000|$|In {{operational}} use the Nelson powerplant proved {{heavy and}} lacking in power and, as the Sailplane Directory terms it, [...] "the result was an under-powered sailplane". The [...] engine gave the Dragonfly a sea level climb rate of just 235 fpm (1.19 m/s) and a <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of 900 ft. As {{a result of the}} performance deficiencies only seven were produced.|$|R
5000|$|Lioré et Olivier LeO C-302:Early autogyros {{suffered}} from relatively long <b>take-off</b> <b>runs.</b> To reduce the take-off length two C-301 aircraft were fitted with {{the equivalent of}} Cierva's [...] "Jump" [...] head allowing the aircraft to leap vertically after only a very short run. The C-302s were used extensively for testing rotor and undercarriage components but development was eventually abandoned in 1949/1950.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream {{up through the}} rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then declutched prior to executing the <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R
