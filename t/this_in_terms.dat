5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot and noise induced motions. A key problem here is the extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> {{of the problem of}} alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E

25|$|His lifework {{was based}} on his {{conviction}} that the Church was founded by God and entrusted {{with the task of}} embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the only law; that, in her capacity as a divine institution, she is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the Church, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God: or, in other words, a defection from Christianity. But any attempt to interpret <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of action would have bound the Church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states.|$|E
25|$|During the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary {{were seen}} on Spanish soil at Ezquioga. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked {{the palms of}} her hands with a sword. Seers gained much {{credence}} in Integrist and Carlist circles. The visions at Ezquioga were widely covered in the press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. Conservative elements in the Spanish Church actively encouraged the Fátima devotion {{as a way of}} countering the perceived threat of atheistic Communism. In Portugal and its former colony of Brazil, conservative groups were sometimes associated with the cult of Fátima. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, some Catholics interpreted <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the Fátima apparitions, and believed that the Virgin's prophecy was about to be fulfilled.|$|E

25|$|The Bohr {{model was}} able to explain the {{emission}} and absorption spectra of hydrogen. The energies of electrons in the n = 1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such {{as the fact that}} helium (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern quantum mechanics explains <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of electron shells and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus the n = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the n = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all n = 1 states are fully occupied; the same for n = 1 and n = 2 in neon. In argon the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{waveguide}} for {{electromagnetic waves}} was first suggested by Lord Rayleigh in 1897. [...] Rayleigh proposed that a coaxial transmission line could have the centre conductor removed, and waves would still propagate down {{the inside of the}} remaining cylindrical conductor despite there no longer being a complete electrical circuit of conductors. [...] He described <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the wave reflecting repeatedly off the internal wall of the outer conductor in a zig-zag fashion as it progressed down the waveguide. [...] Rayleigh was also the first to realise that there was a critical wavelength, the cutoff wavelength, proportional to the cylinder diameter, above which wave propagation is not possible. [...] However, interest in waveguides waned because lower frequencies were more suitable for long distance radio communication. [...] Rayleigh's results were forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others in the 1930s when interest in microwaves revived. [...] Waveguides were first developed, in a circular form, by George Clark Southworth and J. F. Hargreaves in 1932.|$|E
500|$|The {{causes of}} the decline in Crusading and the failure of the Crusader States is multi-faceted. Historians have {{attempted}} to explain <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of Muslim reunification and Jihadi enthusiasm but Thomas Asbridge, amongst others, considers this too simplistic. Muslim unity was sporadic and the desire for Jihad ephemeral. The nature of Crusades was unsuited to the conquest and defence of the Holy Land. Crusaders were on a personal pilgrimage and usually returned when it was completed. Although the philosophy of Crusading changed over time, the Crusades continued to provide short lived armies without centralised leadership led by independently minded potentates. What the Crusader states needed were large standing armies. Religious fervour enabled amazing feats of military endeavour but proved difficult to direct and control. Succession disputes and dynastic rivalries in Europe, failed harvests and heretical outbreaks, all contributed to reducing Latin Europe's concerns for Jerusalem. Ultimately, even though the fighting was also {{at the edge of the}} Islamic world, the huge distances made the mounting of Crusades and the maintenance of communications insurmountably difficult. It enabled Islam, under the charismatic leadership of Nur al-Din and Saladin as well as the ruthless Baibars to use the logistical advantages from proximity to victorious effect. The mainland Crusader states of the [...] outremer [...] were finally extinguished with the fall of Tripoli in 1289 and Acre in 1291. Many Latin Christians were evacuated to Cyprus by boat, were killed or enslaved.|$|E
500|$|Fodor {{responds}} {{to this problem}} with what he defines as [...] "a slightly less crude causal theory". According to this approach, {{it is necessary to}} break the symmetry {{at the base of the}} crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (A= A) and the false ones (A = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be accidents: if in the extension of [...] "horse" [...] there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of [...] "horse" [...] that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if [...] "horse" [...] did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called [...] "horse". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying [...] "this is a horse" [...] presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we put <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] depends on the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse"; but the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse"...|$|E
