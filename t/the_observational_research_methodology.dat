40|$|This {{presentation}} {{tries to}} demonstrate that Portuguese sociology has been built {{on a set of}} virtuous relations between four poles of sociological activity: the theoretical problematization pole, <b>the</b> <b>observational</b> <b>research</b> pole, <b>the</b> reflexivity pole and the professionalization pole. It will be suggested that this specific dynamic was favoured by a series of political-institutional and organisational conditions (the dominance of a critical/applied rationalism in university training, the active role of Portuguese Sociological Association in the promotion of a creative interaction between academics and “field professionals”, the political engagement of Portuguese sociologists, the relatively successful opening-up of the labour market to professionally trained sociologists, etc.). The presentation also includes a comment on the possible contribution of Portuguese sociology to the re-invention of the scientific agenda and practices of the discipline and {{to the development of a}} “public knowledge”. 1. Portuguese sociology started to take shape as an autonomous disciplinary project about forty years ago. The argument that will be developed here is that if this project had been achieved with overall success, this was due to the virtuous interaction between four poles of activity that was established in the field of Portuguese sociology since its very beginning. They are: (i) the theoretical problematization pole, representing the set of efforts which, in the scientific domain in question, seek to encourage theoretical updating and discussion among peers in a systematic way; (ii) <b>the</b> <b>observational</b> <b>research</b> pole, relating to the analysis of concrete social situations through theoretically and methodologically informed procedures for gathering and processing empirical information; (iii) the reflexivity pole, embracing critical and self-critical questioning on positions of principle and foundations of the theoretical options and Edição on line d...|$|R

Although as many as nine areas have been activated by love photos, the most frequently included the orbitofrontal cortex, the ventral tegmental area, the caudate nucleus and the anterior and posterior cingulates. These areas are rich in dopamine and oxytocin, both of which have been notably high in romantic love partners.

40|$|Introduction Even in {{developed}} economies infectious diseases remain {{the most common}} cause of illness in early childhood. Our current understanding of the epidemiology of these infections is limited by reliance on data from decades ago performed using low-sensitivity laboratory methods, and recent studies reporting severe, hospital-managed disease. Methods and analysis <b>The</b> <b>Observational</b> <b>Research</b> in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is an ongoing study enrolling a dynamic birth cohort to document the community-based epidemiology of viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in early childhood. Women are recruited antenatally, and their healthy newborn is followed for the first 2 years of life. Parents keep a daily symptom diary for the study child, collect a weekly anterior nose swab and dirty nappy swab and complete a burden diary when a child meets pre-defined illness criteria. Specimens will be tested for a wide range of viruses by real-time PCR assays. Primary analyses involves calculating incidence rates for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) for the cohort by age and seasonality. Control material from children when they are without symptoms will allow us to determine what proportion of ARIs and AGE can be attributed to specific pathogens. Secondary analyses will assess the incidence and shedding duration of specific respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens.
