5|$|By 1924, <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> {{had a good}} {{circulation}} but {{was losing}} money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in <b>the</b> <b>newspaper,</b> which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
