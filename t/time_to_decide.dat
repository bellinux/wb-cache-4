One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours. The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was not authorized to grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on. It did, however, postpone the impending British attack, allowing Washington more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> if and where to confront the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Braschi {{from the}} Italian Football Federation, was {{appointed}} to officiate the final, making it his first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> a closing match in a European contest. He was regonised as a professional Serie A referee in 1992. The Italian took charge of his first European fixture in a 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup group stage meeting between Lierse and Groningen. The same year, Braschi made FIFA's international referees list; he debuted in February 1997 in a Israel–Germany friendly. Before the final, {{he had been the}} match official in four Champions League and two UEFA Cup matches (including one qualifier), as well as four international friendlies. Braschi was accompanied by an all-Italian team, which was made up of assistant referees Gennaro Mazzei and Pietro Contente – the reserve referee was unveiled as Livio Bazzoli.|$|E

She says to {{him that}} a boy has agreed to marry her, but she is reluctant. She asks Yogesh to give her <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> what to do about her boyfriend. He agrees, telling her about his {{problems}} with Jitu. Sanjana, touched that Yogesh will help her despite his own problems, hugs him. Devu walks in, and thinks he has interrupted them; Sanjana chases him, trying to explain. Tailing Devu, the detective is unaware that he had been with Anila at a hotel and sees him with Sanjana. Sanjana shows Devu a picture; when he says something supposedly demeaning, she becomes angry and tries to leave. Devu stops her, holding her while she cries before they leave in his car. The detective convinces Yogesh and his father that Devu is having an affair with Sanjana. Anila then comes downstairs, looking for Devu. Yogesh shows her the photos, telling her that Devu and Sanjana went to Khandala, a hill station near Mumbai. The detective tells Devu's wife this story, and they find Devu at a hotel with Sanjana. Devu thinks Yogesh betrayed him, and Yogesh thinks Devu is having an affair with Sanjana.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|Chris befriends Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and {{she asks}} him to father her child, to which Chris replies {{that he needs}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide.</b> Chris meets Nate Kinski and they arrange to go a picnic for their first date. Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris not to push him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and his right side is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{won their}} first six games in November before losing in a shootout on November 18. Rob Scuderi and Hal Gill were {{selected}} by Therrien to be November's alternate captains, taking over for Brooks Orpik and Malkin {{who served in}} October. On November 11, the Penguins returned to Detroit {{for the first time}} since the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. The third goal of Jordan Staal's second career hat-trick came with 22.8seconds remaining in regulation, sending the game into overtime where the Penguins achieved a 7–6 victory. Malkin's 13-game point streak ended on November 18, during the streak he scored 27points. Through November 19, the Penguins led the league in overtime games with nine of 18games taking extra <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide.</b> Through the first 20games of the season, Mike Zigomanis led the league in faceoff percentage and Alex Goligoski led rookie defensemen in points. After an injury to Marc-Andre Fleury, Dany Sabourin and rookie John Curry split goaltending duties in his multi-game absence in which the team was 5–6–2. On November 26, Malkin scored three goals for his third career hat-trick, three days later Sidney Crosby also achieved a hat trick—the second of his career. After the team's final game of the month, Malkin and Crosby ranked first and second in league scoring with 39 and 34points respectively. Malkin also ranked first in the league with 29assists, and was named the NHL's second Star of the Month.|$|E

25|$|With the {{bid offer}} expiry date of August 7 approaching, Clearly Canadian decided {{to extend its}} offer {{expiration}} date to August 19. It claimed it was doing this to give shareholders more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> {{whether or not to}} sell their shares. This extension caused further rifts between the two companies, with Sun-Rype claiming reason for the extension, while Clearly Canadian stayed focused on acquiring as many shares as possible. With the final bid deadline fast approaching, Clearly Canadian used many tactics in an attempt to gain more shares, including sending out circulars, hosting public receptions, and talking to community press. In the end however, Sun-Rype, which spent $741,000 fighting the takeover, was able to prevail over Clearly Canadian, losing only 15.8% of its shares to the beverage corporation.|$|E

Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba locked on a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by a slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone. Not willing {{to let him go}} on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.|$|E
25|$|A drop goal (now {{also known}} as a field goal) is worth only one point and is thus the least chosen method of scoring. It is {{attempted}} during general play, and to be valid must be made by a drop kick, and as with penalty and conversion goals, must pass both over the crossbar and between the uprights of the goal-posts. Drop goals are usually attempted when in good field position in an attempt to secure a win late in a close game or when the scores are within a converted try (6 points) of each other so that, if successful, their opponents must score a minimum of two times to avoid losing. Less commonly, drop goals may be attempted just before half-time, to secure the most points scored in the first half. Additionally, it is a common way to win matches in competitions that use golden point extra <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> games that are tied after normal time has elapsed.|$|E

Variation like this depends on age, family, island, and other factors such as poetic speech. It can be difficult at <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which is most correct — different people have different opinions (and sometimes have very strong opinions).|$|R

25|$|On 19 May 1898, Aguinaldo {{decided to}} resume the {{revolution}} {{and returned to the}} Philippines through American aid. Among those who returned with him was Estrella. When the Philippine–American War broke out on 4 February 1899, Estrella {{was one of the first}} generals to see action outside Manila. On 5 February, the Americans positioned themselves in the outskirts of San Roque (now part of Cavite City), which Filipino troops are being commanded by Estrella. Three days later, on 8 February, Second Lieutenant John Glass of the 1st Battalion of the California Heavy Artillery (California National Guard) was sent with an escort to demand Estrella the surrender and the evacuation of the town. Otherwise, artillery and gunboat bombardment would be done against them. By this time, the gunboats Manila and Callao have been positioned just outside the town to assist the offensive. On 9 February, the town mayor approached Commodore George Dewey to ask for more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> the matter. When Dewey refused, the Filipinos raised the white flag of surrender. However, this was only a deception to lure the Americans into attacking the town. When the Americans managed to occupy San Roque, the retreating Filipinos set the town on fire. In order to gain access to the area, the Americans had to flank it from the sea. Meanwhile, skirmishes were undertaken whenever the Americans caught up with the Filipinos. Estrella would continue leading Filipino troops for the rest of the year, even fighting alongside Brigadier General Pío del Pilar in Guadalupe, Makati (then part of Rizal). However, on 8 June 1900, Estrella was caught with Pío del Pilar by the American secret police (which utilized a native contingent headed by Captain Lara) at Guadalupe.|$|E

Erskine, however, perceived it differently, and had records of the entire trial printed and sent to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden. Taking this as a hint, Fox (after much delay) introduced a Bill to Parliament in May 1791, seeking to reform the law relating to libel. After it was passed through the Commons {{it went to the}} House of Lords, where members of the judiciary attemted to delay it; in response Lord Camden, then 78, rose and bluntly stated that if the judges were to be the sole arbiters of public opinion, nothing would be able to appear that criticised the government, leading to a stifling of the freedom of the press. His appeal was successful – without it, historian H. M. Lubasz writes, the Bill would never have passed the Lords – and within three weeks Parliament had formally passed the Libel Act 1792, commonly known as Fox's Libel Act, allowing juries for the first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> precisely what constituted libel.<45> ...|$|E
