40|$|BACKGROUND: Preservation {{of fossil}} {{vertebrates}} in volcanic rocks is extremely rare. An articulated skull (cranium and mandible) of a rhinoceros {{was found in}} a 9. 2 ± 0. 1 Ma-old ignimbrite of Cappadocia, Central Turkey. The unusual aspect of the preserved hard tissues of the skull (rough bone surface and brittle dentine) allows suspecting a peri-mortem exposure to a heating source. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe and identify the skull as belonging to the large two-horned rhinocerotine Ceratotherium neumayri, well-known in the late Miocene of the Eastern Mediterranean Province. Gross structural features and microscopic changes of hard tissues (bones and teeth) are then monitored and compared to the results of forensic and archaeological studies and experiments focusing on heating effects, in order to reconstruct the hypothetical peri-mortem conditions. Macroscopic and microscopic structural changes on compact bones (canaliculi and lamellae vanished), as well as partial dentine/cementum disintegration, drastic enamel-dentine disjunctions or microscopic cracks affecting all hard dental tissues (enamel, cementum, and dentine) point to continued exposures to temperatures around 400 - 450 °C. Comparison to other cases of preservation of fossil vertebrates within volcanic rocks points unambiguously to some similarity with the 79 AD Plinian eruption of the Vesuvius, in Italy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A 9. 2 ± 0. 1 Ma-old pyroclastic density current, sourced from the Çardak caldera, likely provoked the instant death of the Karacaşar rhino, before the body of the latter experienced severe dehydration (leading to the wide and sustainable opening of the mouth), was then dismembered within the pyroclastic flow of subaerial origin, the skull being separated from the remnant body and baked under a temperature approximating 400 °C, then <b>transported</b> northward, <b>rolled,</b> and trapped in disarray into that pyroclastic flow forming the pinkish Kavak- 4 ignimbrite ∼ 30 km North from the upper Miocene vent...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} transport of a passive tracer in the time-dependent flow corresponding to a Rayleigh number scrR slightly above the scrRt {{at the onset of}} the even oscillatory instability for Rayleigh-Bénard convection rolls. By modeling the flow with a stream function, we show how to construct and identify invariant structures in the flow that act as a ‘‘template’’ for the motion of fluid particles, in the absence of molecular diffusivity. This approach and symmetry considerations allow us to write explicit formulas that describe the tracer transport for finite times. In the limit of small amplitude of the oscillation, i. e., when (scrR-scrRt) 1 / 2 is small, we show that the amount of fluid <b>transported</b> across a <b>roll</b> boundary grows linearly with the amplitude, in agreement with the experimental and numerical findings of Solomon and Gollub [Phys.

Control allocations methods are used when there are more command inputs than controlled variables. Constraints that require allocators are such task as; surface saturation limits, structural load limits, drag reduction constraints or actuator failures. Most transport aircraft have many actuated surfaces compared to the three controlled variables (such as angle of attack, roll rate & angle of side slip). To distribute the control effort among the redundant set of actuators a fixed mixer approach can be utilized or online control allocation techniques. The benefit of an online allocator is that constraints can {{be considered in the}} design whereas the fixed mixer cannot. However, an online control allocator mixer has a disadvantage of not guaranteeing a surface schedule, which can then produce ill defined loads on the aircraft.

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Aims. We {{study the}} recently discovered twisting motion of bright penumbral filaments {{with the aim}} of constraining their geometry and the associated magnetic field. Methods. A large sunspot located 40 ◦ from disk center was observed at high resolution with the 1 -m Swedish Solar Telescope. Inversions of multi-wavelength polarimetric data and speckle reconstructed time series of continuum images were used to determine proper motions, as well as the velocity and magnetic structure in penumbral filaments. Results. The continuum movie reveals apparent lateral motions of bright and dark structures inside bright filaments oriented parallel to the limb, confirming recent Hinode results. In these filaments we measure upflows of≈ 1. 1 km/s on their limbward side and weak downflows on their centerward side. The magnetic field in them is significantly weaker and more horizontal than in the adjacent dark filaments. Conclusions. The data indicate the presence of vigorous convective rolls in filaments with a nearly horizontal magnetic field. These are separated by filaments harbouring stronger, more vertical fields. Because of reduced gas pressure, we see deeper into the latter. When observed near the limb, the disk-centerward side of the horizontal-field filaments appear bright due to the hot wall effect known from faculae.

The thesis {{is included in}} the mechanical engineering program and contains 22. 5 university points, which is equivalent to 480 hours of work including self-study.   This work has implemented by the student Luiz Ferreira in cooperation with the firm Camatec Industriteknik AB in Karlstad.   The purpose of this project has been that the company Camatec wants to offer their customers a standard vertical transporter. This transporter must be able to <b>transport</b> paper <b>rolls,</b> which can weigh up to 5 tons, between two floors. The objective with this project has been to prepare a complete set of drawings for a vertical transporter and a price estimate of all its components. This transporter must fit into a given elevator shaft but also be able to adapt into different dimensions.   A vertical transporter has been developed with help of different methods including 3 D-modeling, Finite Element Method and strength calculations.   The total development of the transporter has been divided into several areas of constructions: Receiver for paper rolls An existing receiver for paper rolls has been redesigned and adapted into the new construction. Frame A frame has been developed including I-beams, flat bars and hollow structural sections which have been connected with welding and bolts to hold the receiver. Mechanism A mechanism of shaft and bearings, which allow the receiver to rotate so the paper rolls can relief in a facility way, has been designed. Guiding A guiding section has been developed, in which t-grids have been used to guide the transporter along the given elevator shaft. Vibration damper Two ANB 100 vibration dampers with a hardness of 70 Shore have been used to suppress one side of the receiver so it can rotate. Hoist An appropriate rope hoist for this transporter has been discussed with the firm ABUS Kransystem AB in Karlstad. This hoist carries almost the entire transporter.   Standard components are used through the entire project and these have been estimated at an amount of about 306   000 Swedish crowns, where prices for the existing solution of receiver, processing and installation are not included...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The common {{transportation}} {{methods for}} the consumers of the ironwork {{such as the}} steel roll coils manufactured from the steelworks were either by the land transportation or the sea transportation. In order to <b>transport</b> the steel <b>roll</b> coil effectively and safely to the destination, {{the stability of the}} steel roll coil which induced the minimum movements during the transportation was strongly required. The basic transportation equipment for the steel roll coil such as the dunnage is made of 100 % imported wood known as the apitong. However, the material characteristic such as the rigidity has caused permanent damages to the steel roll coil and the damaged steel roll coils were not easily restorable thus they were unsuitable for other purposes. Therefore, the introduction of new materials manufacturing dunnages which would have a good recovery performance and thus enable the damage prevention or reduction to the steel roll coil or any other products during the transportation is needed. This investigation was to develop the new and improved type of a dunnage from observing the current dunnage in the following areas; the array or the types of reinforcements that established the construction of the dunnage, the dunnage forming shapes of a rectangle and a trapezoid, the direct impacts to dunnage in the presence of vibration when the carrier was moving and stopping, and the critical impact to the dunnage due to the edge loading. Ultimately, the development of new type of dunnage that consisted of characteristics being soft and recoverable than the existing apitong dunnage and induces little or no damages to the steel roll coils are required...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{important}} {{problem in the}} last phase of manufacturing in the textile industry. This involves cutting large lengths of fabric into smaller pieces, which are then wrapped around rolls. The quality of cloth <b>rolls</b> <b>transported</b> to the customer is specified {{by the quality of}} fabric pieces that make up the roll. A piece of fabric falls within a given quality category if some of its characteristics, such as, piece length, the number of critical defects per metre, and the defective score per metre, are compatible with the corresponding quality specifications. Naturally, the selling price per metre of fabric is proportional to the quality category. Thus, it becomes necessary to determine an optimal cutting strategy of very long woven fabric (e. g. 2000 m) into smaller pieces (e. g. each 130 m long at most), which involves a difficult continuous assignment problem of identifying the optimal cutting: locations of pieces overlapping with defects of known lengths and locations. Not only must the scrap be minimized but the overall profit per metre fabric should be maximized. The two objectives may not always support each other due to relative unit selling prices of various quality categories. The solution to this problem has an immediate impact on company profit. The mathematical formulation of the problem involves numerous binary variables as well as continuous variables. A Mutative Simulated Annealing approach is proposed here to solve this problem. The solution technique is tested both on real data obtained from a textile manufacturer and hypothetical data. Results are compared against upper bounds calculated for each objective defined, as well as with a sequential heuristic designed for this problem...|$|R
40|$|Part I The forced Korteweg-de Vries {{model has}} been found {{satisfactory}} in predicting the periodic generation of upstream-advancing solitary waves by a bottom topography moving in a layer of shallow water with a steady transcritical velocity. It is also known that with certain characteristic forcing distributions, there exist waves, according to the fKdV model, which can remain steady in accompanying the characteristic forcing, provided such a wave exists initially, whereas for a different initial condition the phenomenon of periodic generation can still manifest itself. The stability of two such transcritically forced steady solitary waves is investigated, with their bifurcation diagrams determined {{with respect to the}} velocity and the amplitude of the forcing as parameters. The linear stability analysis is first carried out; it involves solving a singular, non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problem, which is examined by applying techniques of matched asymptotic expansions with suitable multiscales for singular perturbations, about the isolated bifurcation points of the parameters. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the full range of the parameters are then obtained by numerically summing a power series expansion for the solution. The numerical results, which accurately match with the local analysis, show that the eigenvalues have only four branches σ = ±σ r ±iσ i. The real part σ r is nonvanishing for the velocity less than a certain supercritical value and for the amplitude greater than a certain marginal bound except at a single point in the parametric plane at which the external forcings vanish, reducing the forced waves to the classical free solitary wave. Within this parametric range, the real part of the four eigenvalues is algebraically two to five orders smaller than the imaginary part σ i, wherever σ i exists; such a small σ r indicates physically a weak exponential growth rate of perturbed solutions and mathematically the need of a very accurate numerical method for its determination. Beyond this parametric range, linear stability theory appears to fail because no eigenvalues can there be found to exist. In this latter case a non linear analysis based on the functional Hamiltonian formulation is found to prevail, and our analysis predicts stability. Finally, extensive numerical simulations using various finite difference schemes are pursued, with results providing full confirmation to the predictions made in various regimes by the analysis. We consider the Korteweg-de Vries equation in the semi-infinite real line with a boundary condition at the origin. The numerical investigations of Chu et al. [2], are revisited and different new forms for the boundary forcing are assumed. In order to provide some qualitative description for the numerical simulations we develop a simple model based on the IST formalism. It is found that the model is also able to provide some quantitative predictions in agreement with the numerical results. Part II There has been considerable interest recently on chaotic advection, for the first time explored in the context of Rayleigh-Benard roll (2 D) convection by the experimental work of J. Gollub and collaborators. When the Rayleigh number increases across a (supercritical) value, depending on the wavelength of the rolls, an oscillatory instability sets in. The flow near the onset of the instability can still be modelled by a stream function, which can be split into a time independent part plus a small time dependent perturbation. The motion of fluid particles can therefore be regarded as the flow for a near integrable, "one-and a half" degree of freedom Hamiltonian vector field, with the phase space corresponding to the physical domain. In absence of molecular diffusivity, the evolution of a certain region of phase space can thus be viewed as the motion of a dyed part of fluid, when the tracer is perfectly passive. The most important objects for a theory of transport are the invariant manifolds for the Poincare map of the flow homoclinic to fixed points, which physically correspond to the stagnation points. As fluid particles cannot cross invariant lines, these curves constitute a sort of "template" for their motion. For the time independent flow, the invariant manifolds connect the stagnation points and define the roll boundaries. Thus, no <b>transport</b> from <b>roll</b> to roll can occur in this case. Switching the perturbation on, these connections are broken and the manifolds are free to wander along the array of rolls. We use segments of stable and unstable manifold to define the time dependent analogue of the <b>roll</b> boundaries. <b>Transport</b> of fluid across a boundary can then be attributed to the way a region bounded by segments of stable and unstable manifold, or "lobe," is evolving under map iterations. This allows us to write explicit formulae for describing the fluid transport in terms of a few of these lobes, for a general cross section defining the Poincare map. Using the symmetries of special cross sections, we are able to further reduce the number of necessary lobes to just one. Furthermore, these symmetries allow us to derive analytically a lower and upper bound for the first time tracer invades a roll, and a lower bound on the stretching of the interface between dyed and clear fluid. These results are independent {{of the fact that the}} perturbation is small. When this is the case however, the analytical tools of the Melnikov and subharmonic Melnikov functions are available, so that an approximation to the lobe areas and location and size of the island bands can be determined analytically. It turns out that in our case these approximations are quite good, even for relatively large perturbations. The results we have produced regarding the strong dependence of transport on the period of the oscillation suggest an effect for which no experimental verification is currently available. The presence of molecular diffusivity introduces a (long) time scale into the problem. We discuss the applicability of the theory in this situation, by introducing a simple rule for determining when the effects of diffusivity are negligible, and perform numerical simulations of the flow in this case to provide an example. </p...|$|R

This pilot is subsequently being collaboratively expanded upon, through the UK Department for Transport funded ???Network Northamptonshire Total Transport??? initiative, a transformative project to improve connectivity, integration and accessibility for rural transport networks. This forms part of the recently signed ???Heart of England??? economic tri-county alliance agreement, which aims to work collaboratively across three local authority regions (Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire), consolidating ?? 3 bn of spending. This provides a further future platform for innovative <b>transport</b> solutions being <b>rolled</b> out across wider geographical areas. The initial Hertfordshire demonstrator pilot project explored how a ???smart??? m-ticketing platform could provide a sustainable financial business model for implementing ticketing solutions for small and medium bus operators within rural Shires, outside of large urban settings. This unique project was the first scan-on bus mobile ticket product used in the UK (outside of London). It offers a partnership model and governance structure for local authorities, commercial operators and other stakeholders with an interest in integrated sustainable transport to take forward, and leads to the possibility of new, socially innovative models for procuring and delivering transport solutions. Initial user reactions have been positive, generating large digital data sets, analysis of which indicates rapid user uptake in comparison to other schemes. This data enables detailed analysis such as precise user geo-spatial distribution, supporting targeted marketing and route-specific promotions to encourage further service uptake. A critical success factor of the project was to target a reduction of on-bus cash handling by five per cent within the first 12 months. This would aid in reducing bus loading times, improve reliability and operator efficiencies. After an initial 16 month operational use, uptake growth in excess of 7 per cent of total revenue has been achieved, on specific routes the transfer to m-ticket has exceeded 12 per cent, with targets of 10 per cent of total cash to mobile conversion predicted by the middle of 2017, likely to be realised. The effectiveness of marketing campaigns, technical development aspects and implementation issues will be reported. These projects have a wider context. Public transport services in rural areas in England are deregulated, and have at present no effective statutory backing or ring-fenced funding. As a result, with reductions in funding to local authorities, funding for non-commercial bus services is being sharply reduced and many authorities are proposing to cease all funding for local bus services (Campaign for Better Transport, 2016). These projects may offer alternative cost-effective ways of providing local transport services in non-metropolitan areas, and thus provide the potential for unique future research opportunities. These include understanding the uptake of smart multi-modal solutions in rural areas to improve accessibility and connectivity through enhanced services for new users and for those with restricted or reduced mobility networks, whilst also offering efficiencies for operators. This research has added importance, because the UK Government is proposing legislation on bus services in England, which would confer significant extra powers on local authorities to intervene in the bus market in various ways. These projects may act as pathfinders for the use of these powers in non-metropolitan areas. Structures supporting a partnership approach involving all those with an interest in public transport are a critical part of improving rural connectivity and accessibility. Through the experience of establishing quality partnership models in Hertfordshire, this paper will go on to detail the subsequent work now underway developing a Social Enterprise model involving local government, universities, operators, health and education services in Northamptonshire, which will form the basis of the transformation of rural integrated sustainable transport delivery...|$|R
