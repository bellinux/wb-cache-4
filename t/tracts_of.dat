5|$|A large temple also owned sizable <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> {{land and}} {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic {{as well as}} religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.|$|E
5|$|Also nearby was the Shoemaker family, which owned {{substantial}} <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land in {{both the}} District and in Maryland. Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property: Fort Simmons, Fort Mansfield, and Battery Bailey. Despite the loss of much of their land, the Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry items to the garrison at Fort Bayard.|$|E
5|$|Any {{electrical}} current generates a magnetic field; neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields, and in functional magnetoencephalography the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution. Tractography uses MRI and image analysis to create 3D {{images of the}} nerve <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> the brain. Connectograms give a graphical representation of the neural connections of the brain.|$|E

From Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, he received leases on ten square miles of land in return for his surveys of land along the Grand River.|$|E
5|$|Clark's militia {{was under}} the {{authority}} of the state of Virginia, and although a continental flag was flown over Fort Sackville, the area was governed as Virginia territory until the state gave it to the United States federal government in 1784. Clark was awarded large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land in southern Indiana for his service in the war and modern Clark County is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the large}} sheep {{producing}} nations of South America, Australia and New Zealand sheep are usually bred on large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land with much less intervention from the graziers or breeders.

50|$|Spinospinal columns are {{collections}} of fibers, ascending, descending, crossed and uncrossed, that connect {{various levels of}} the spinal cord and are located between the spinal central gray and the long tracts that surround it.

50|$|The {{life cycle}} was {{determined}} in 1914. These parasites have two hosts {{in their life}} cycle (heteroxenous). Sexual stages {{are found in the}} digestive <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> cephalopods and asexual stages infect the digestive <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> crustaceans.|$|R
5|$|Major <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> the Allen Ranch were {{liquidated}} {{opening up}} new development around Pasadena and other bayside communities. Commercial fishing for oysters and shrimp grew {{as a significant}} area industry. The lumber industry also continued to grow. A sugar refinery opened in Texas city, a paper mill in Pasadena, and other factories in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{circulation of}} coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land, empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes. Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land, yet powerful merchants {{were able to}} avoid registration and own large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land.|$|E
50|$|The cuneate {{fasciculus}}, fasciculus cuneatus (<b>tract</b> <b>of</b> Burdach, {{named for}} Karl Friedrich Burdach) is a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> nerves in {{the spinal cord}} that primarily transmits information from the arms.

30|$|The shale {{units of}} the {{transgressive}} system <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> genetic sequences I and II in {{which most of the}} maximum flooding surfaces occur together with the highstand system <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> genetic II and III {{have been found to be}} the major source rocks and field-wide seal. The reservoir sands of the shelfal lowstand system <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> genetic sequence II and highstand system <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> genetic sequence III have been revealed to be major hydrocarbon reservoirs in the study. Up-dip lateral migration along faults (major and minor) has been identified as the probable hydrocarbon migration pathway. The hydrocarbon reservoirs of shelfal lowstand system tract and highstand system tract together with shale {{units of the}} transgressive system tract can form good stratigraphic traps for hydrocarbon.|$|R
5|$|Wendy {{caused a}} large amount of damage in central Japan. The storm flooded {{thousands}} of homes and damaged significant <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land. Some rivers overflowed and hundreds of bridges were destroyed. Overall, 28 people were killed, and 19 were missing.|$|E

Land purchased by Allen and his brothers included <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land that eventually became Burlington, Vermont. He was twice married, fathering eight children.|$|E

5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land in the west that provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which {{laid the foundation for}} the modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land enclosed by stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for new developments, and Worcester proved no exception. By {{the end of the century}} the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E
50|$|In 1899, both {{countries}} dug a channel across {{the heel of}} the horseshoe bend of the river at the dispute site for flood control purpose. This moved a 385-acre <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> land to the U.S. side of the river, but as man-made alterations do not change the boundary, this <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> land remained Mexican territory. This <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> land {{came to be known}} as Cordova Island, in a sense it was an island belonging to Mexico inside U.S. territory. Thus, there was little or no control by the local authorities, which created a haven for crime and opportunities for illegal crossings.|$|R
