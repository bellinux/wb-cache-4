Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West.

Electronic databases and additional handsearching were used to identify randomized controlled trial (RCT). We included studies reporting data separately for nulliparous and/or multiparous in women with unfavourable cervix (Bishop < 5) and intact membranes. The primary efficacy outcome was caesarean section (CS) rate. Primary safety outcome was uterine hyperstimulation requiring immediate delivery. Eighteen RCTs were eligible and seven studies were included (totally 911 patients). The dinoprostone vaginal insert reduces CS rate in nulliparous women of 24 % compared to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> of administration (RR = 0. 76, 95 % CI = 0. 59, 0. 98).

The fixed effects of herd-year-month of calving as contemporary group and age at calving and Holstein gene percentage as covariate were fitted. Orthogonal legendre polynomial with a 4 th-order was implemented {{to take account of}} genetic and environmental aspects of milk production over the course of lactation. RRM using Legendre polynomials as base functions appears to be the most adequate to describe the covariance structure of the data. The results showed that the average of heritability for the second half of lactation period was higher <b>than</b> that of <b>the</b> first half. The heritability value for the first month was lowest (0. 117) and for the eighth month of the lactation was highest (0. 230) compared to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> months of lactation. Because of genetic variation was increased gradually, and residual variance was high in the first months of lactation, heritabilities were different over the course of lactation. The RRMs with a higher number of parameters were more useful to describe the genetic variation of test-day milk yield throughout the lactation. In {{this research}} estimation of genetic parameters, and calculation genetic correlations were implemented by random regression test day model, therefore using this method is the exact way to take account of parameters rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways...</b>|$|R

By using Granger causality model approach four testable hypotheses are investigated: (1) does the money supply growth Granger-cause inflation? (2) Does currency devaluation Granger cause inflation?

The empirical results suggest that there existed a bi-directional causality between broad money supply growth and inflation and unidirectional causality between currency devaluation and inflation as well as oil price and inflation.
