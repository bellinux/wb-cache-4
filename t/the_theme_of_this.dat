The title is taken from the Ken Kesey novel, Sometimes a Great Notion. The book is one of Weddle's favorites.

500|$|John Lasseter, {{executive}} producer of Bolt, decided to make [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] the theme for Bolt, since it lyrically summarized the film's plot. He said, [...] " [...] so sums up <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> film. You know, a dog and its owner and they both were separated, but they love each other so much — there's such an emotional payoff when these characters get reunited, and I think that's what this song's about." [...] Lasseter thought that solely the song worked, but it worked better for the film. [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] {{is one of two}} songs on the Bolt soundtrack and was released to Radio Disney to promote Bolt and its accompanying soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Espenson {{said that}} this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they {{realized}} {{it was going to be}} airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to [...] "lean into" [...] this theme. Unusual for Once Upon a Time, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is doing this, but really his actions are motivated by not believing that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and [...] "preserve as much as we could of the fairy tale side," [...] as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.|$|E
500|$|Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed {{gave the}} episode a 3.5/5 rating and commented that [...] "perhaps {{it is not}} {{profound}} in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally, but it handles the topic in a serious manner while not compromising the show's humor. The side story with Bart stems from {{the era of the}} series when Bart was the big star, but it still has some funny bits." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "Mean Homer equals Funny Homer, so 'When Flanders Failed' presents an above average show. He seems unusually crude here, which makes him amusing. The subplot with Bart and his karate class also adds good material, especially when he threatens to turn the 'Touch of Death' on Lisa. Another sappy finish slightly mars this one, but it remains generally solid." [...] Kimberly Potts of AOL named it tenth best episode of the show and commented: [...] "Schadenfreude is <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tight episode about Homer's joy at the failure of Flanders' Leftorium store. There are few times Homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating Flanders and using Ned's yard sale grill, and we haven't even mentioned Bart's 'Touch of Death' subplot." [...] Winston-Salem Journals Tim Clodfelter called it an [...] "outstanding" [...] episode.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the sequel}} was {{conceived}} at one of Marvel's semi-annual editorial retreats. Axel Alonso, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, stated that unlike other major comic book storylines which take years of planning, he only had {{three to four months}} to plan [...] "Civil War II". This abbreviated timetable was necessary in order to capitalize on the release of the feature film , which was released in May 2016. According to the official synopsis, a strange new character with the power to accurately predict the outcome of future events comes {{to the attention of the}} world. This power divides the heroes on how best to utilize the information, with Captain Marvel wanting to profile future crimes before they occur, and Iron Man believing that [...] "the punishment cannot come before the crime." [...] The situation reaches a turning point when it is predicted that one of the heroes will be the cause of major destruction, forcing the others to make a difficult decision. Bendis said, [...] "People's personal accountability is <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> one... from the way cops are acting on camera, to the way people talk to each other online." [...] The plot for [...] "Civil War II" [...] began to develop in the second volume of The Invincible Iron Man, which is also written by Bendis and drawn by Marquez.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{had a more}} mixed reaction, {{giving the}} episode a rating of C+ and criticizing lead guest actor Cameron Monaghan, [...] "In this role, he was a drag, playing 'rebellious teen' in a stock, wooden way, with no extra layers. Also, nobody—not even Joshua Jackson, whom I've come to {{appreciate}} more as an actor over the run of this show—could make the 'My mind is being controlled!' scenes look anything other than goofy." [...] Murray also said, [...] "Yet for all my griping, I was quite taken with <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the tinfoil Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in 'Of Human Action' about childish things." [...] Ramsey Isler from IGN graded the episode 8.0/10, explaining that despite it being a [...] "standalone" [...] episode, it was [...] "a high-intensity, action-filled tale that kept the adrenaline flowing. Fringe is usually more of a cerebral show, but there's nothing wrong with appealing to our love of action every now and then". Also positive was Chanel Reeder of Newsarama, who believed Fringe [...] "totally deliver in its most recent episode. The twists are back, along with the dramatic high intensity moments that the show is known for." [...] Reeder praised the plot twist of Tyler being the mind controller, and {{was pleased with the}} increased presence of Massive Dynamic.|$|E
