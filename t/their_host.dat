5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from <b>their</b> <b>host</b> and become lost.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} {{can help}} to control pests by depriving them of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plants. It is a major tactic in the control of corn rootworm, and has reduced early season incidence of Colorado potato beetle {{by as much as}} 95%.|$|E
5|$|After a {{potential}} dormant {{period in the}} liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, parasites whose {{reproduction}} is largely tied to <b>their</b> <b>host's</b> reproductive success {{tend to become}} less virulent or [...] mutualist, so that <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> reproduce more effectively.|$|R
50|$|The Foettingeriidae are {{a family}} of apostome ciliates of the order Apostomatida. Like other apostomes, they are {{symbiotic}} with Crustacea, and live in microbial cysts on <b>their</b> <b>host's</b> exoskeleton {{for most of their}} life. They excyst, or leave their cysts, when <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> molt <b>their</b> exoskeleton in order to feed on the exuvial fluids trapped in <b>their</b> <b>host's</b> molted exoskeleton.|$|R
25|$|Parasites {{are able}} to exploit <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> {{for a variety of}} functions. Many insect ectoparasites {{including}} bedbugs, batbugs, lice and fleas have lost their ability to fly, relying instead on <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> for transport. Trait loss more generally is widespread among parasites.|$|R
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to host-water dependence, dwarf mistletoes must acquire carbohydrate and mineral nutrition from <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> Dwarf mistletoes have both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and the necessary mechanisms for photosynthesis, but chlorophyll concentrations in dwarf mistletoes are approximately 1/5 to 1/10 of {{those found in}} <b>their</b> <b>host’s</b> foliage, and dwarf mistletoes have low photosynthetic rates {{as measured by the}} rate of carbon fixation. The principal carbohydrate transported from the host to dwarf mistletoe is sucrose. Dwarf mistletoes are phloem deficient; therefore, dwarf mistletoes draw carbohydrates from <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> by connections to the host phloem and ray parenchyma. The rate of carbohydrate transport between dwarf mistletoes varies according to season, but dwarf mistletoes continuously draw carbohydrates from <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> throughout the year.|$|R
25|$|Parasites use {{a variety}} of methods to infect <b>their</b> <b>hosts,</b> {{including}} physical contact, the fecal-oral route, free-living infectious stages, and insect vectors, suiting <b>their</b> differing <b>hosts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Chrysiridia rhipheus is {{the sole}} {{specialist}} herbivore of the four species of Omphalea in Madagascar. Omphalea is toxic: the toxins are sequestered by the feeding caterpillar and retained in the pupal and adult stages. Thousands of these moths migrate between the eastern and western ranges of <b>their</b> <b>host</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union {{launched}} {{a process for}} giving proper names to certain exoplanets and <b>their</b> <b>host</b> stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Brahe for this planet.

50|$|Parasites can {{significantly}} affect <b>their</b> <b>hosts,</b> {{as well as}} the structure of the communities to which they and <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> belong (Minchella and Scott 1991).

50|$|The eugregarines and neogregarines {{differ in}} a number of respects.

5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} <b>their</b> <b>host</b> species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks.

50|$|The dermanyssid mites {{are visible}} to the naked eye and have long {{powerful}} legs that they use to seek <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> These mites live in the nest of <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> or within the fabric of poultry houses. They infest <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> whilst feeding for short periods. Their mouthparts are long complex organs adapted for piercing <b>their</b> <b>host's</b> skin and sucking blood. Dermanyssus gallinae, the red chicken mite is typical. Dense infestations of a poultry house cause much biting stress and loss of production to the birds, and human workers in the houses are bitten. Originally a parasite centered on the nest of its host, this species has become a major pest in commercial poultry houses. A similar genus is Ornithonyssus; O.bursa, the tropical fowl mite, and O.sylvarium the northern fowl mite cause similar problems in poultry production.|$|R

Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around, or crossing in front of, <b>their</b> <b>host</b> stars as seen from Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star briefly and slightly dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E
40|$|Three {{commonly}} occurring root parasites (Alectra vogelii Benth., Alectra orobanchoides Benth., Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze) {{as well as}} <b>their</b> <b>hosts</b> were cultivated and their NRA determined. Nitrate reductase activity, albeit extremely low, could be induced with nitrate application.

40|$|If the {{relationships}} between baculoviruses and <b>their</b> insect <b>hosts</b> are subject to coevolution, this should lead to long-term evolutionary effects such as the specialization of these pathogens for <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> To test this hypothesis, a phylogeny of the Baculoviridae, including 39 viruses from hosts of the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera, was reconstructed based on sequences from the genes lef- 8 and ac 22. The tree showed a clear division of the baculoviruses according {{to the order of}} <b>their</b> <b>hosts.</b> This division highlighted the need to reconsider the classification of the baculoviruses to include one or possibly two new genera. Furthermore, the specialization of distinct virus lineages to particular insect orders suggests ancient coevolutionary interactions between baculoviruses and <b>their</b> <b>hosts...</b>|$|R
