40|$|Smolt {{predation}} in {{the vicinity}} of Yaquina and Coos bays, Oregon, by one bird species, the common murre Uria aalge, appears to be very high. One strategy to reduce mortality of salmon smolts is to transport them in a vehicle for release offshore where predators are less likely to concentrate. Offshore releases of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in Sweden and Norway yielded consistently higher returns than onshore releases. Preliminary results with offshore release of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha in Oregon are mixed, but handling and transport methods are suspected {{to play an important role}} in survival of smolts released offshore. Smolts released offshore from a <b>towed</b> <b>net</b> pen exhibited a much higher return rate than smolts released from a tank aboard a fishing vessel or from a towed barge.

Alternate approaches are sometimes needed. This study examines the relationship between biomass obtained from 197 mixed-species zooplankton net samples and proximate acoustic backscatter data collected over six summers, a depth range of 3, 000 m, and a spatial scale of 200 km centered at a major hydrothermal region in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.

40|$|Abstract. —Understanding {{sampling}} {{effectiveness is}} critical to gear selection and the determi-nation of larval fish dynamics. We evaluated bow-mounted push nets for collecting larval fish across reservoirs and habitats and compared them with traditional <b>tow</b> <b>nets.</b> By means of a pushed 0. 5 -m-diameter conical <b>net</b> and <b>towed</b> 0. 5 -m-diameter and 0. 75 -m-diameter conical nets, ichthyo-plankton samples were taken during daylight hours from May to July on 21 reservoirs that varied in morphological and environmental characteristics. The push net had higher catches than the same-diameter <b>tow</b> <b>net.</b> However, the push net was not as efficient as the larger-sized <b>tow</b> <b>net</b> in July, when larvae are larger. For pelagic habitats, bow-mounted push <b>nets</b> or large <b>tow</b> <b>nets</b> will sample the larval fish community more efficiently than traditional 0. 5 -m-diameter conical <b>tow</b> <b>nets.</b> We also assessed push nets for sampling nearshore littoral habitats (, 1. 0 m in depth). Across reservoirs the littoral areas had much higher catch rates than did the offshore pelagic zone; estimates of peak larval fish densities were four times as high in the littoral zone. Deriving estimates of larval fish abundance from pelagic habitats only will probably lead to underestimation of total larval fish densities. The versatility of the push net in sampling littoral habitats is an important consideration when designing surveys to estimate larval fish communities. Bow-mounted pus...|$|R
40|$|Light traps {{are one of}} {{a number}} of {{different}} gears used to sample pelagic larval and juvenile fishes. In contrast to conventional <b>towed</b> <b>nets,</b> light traps primarily collect larger size classes, including settlement-size larvae (Choat et al., 1993; Hickford and Schiel, 1999; Hernandez and Shaw, 2003), and, therefore, have become important tools for discerning recruitment dynamics (Sponaugle and Cowen, 1996; Wilson, 2001). The relative ease with which multiple synoptic light trap samples can be taken means that larval distribution patterns can be mapped with greater spatial resolution (Doherty, 1987).

Basing on the materials obtained by the subsidiary trawlers belonging to the Fish-meal fleets operating on the Bering Sea in 1963 and in 1965, the possible relationship between the catches of the eastern net and the towing-force of the trawler which is to be denoted by the resultant of the Gross tonnage and the Horse Power of the main engine was put under investigation, with the following results obtained : 1) The increase of the Horse Power of the main engine of the trawler seemed to have been coincided with the responsive increase of the catch per one unit of the <b>towing</b> <b>net,</b> which was to be observed most remarkably at the good-catching period. 2) Each increase in the total tonnage seemed to have been accompanied by the increase in the catch per one unit of the <b>towing</b> <b>net,</b> though this was not so remarkable as in the above mentioned case. 3) The towing speed might be regarded as one of the chief factors in the formation of this relationship between the catch and the Horse Power of the main engine, but the versatility of the towing speed, easily influenced by the net-size, sea-condition and the catches make necessary the execution of the spot investigations. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the ability, {{mechanism}} and problems for controlling the depth of a <b>towed</b> <b>net</b> using a canvas kite, a model test {{was carried out in}} a flume tank. The changes of the depth and attack angle of the model netting mouth, which depended on the pulling length of the lifting rope, were measured under two conditions, one in which a lifting rope was connected to a model kite (W/K) and another in which a lifting rope was directly connected {{to the top of the}} netting mouth (W/O) for purposes of comparison. The results obtained in this study were as follows. The depth decreased monotonously depending on the pulling length under the W/O condition, but it changed by decreasing or increasing under the W/K condition. The range of attack angle was from 15 to - 10 degrees in the pulling length for the effective control of the W/K condition, while in the W/O condition, the attack angle of netting mouth decreased monotonously. The primary factor of the depth control using a kite seemed to be a direction of hydraulic forces by kite on the net mouth, and a relationship between the depth and angle of net mouth was shown, but there was a negligible influence on the projected area of netting mouth in the effective control. The effective ability and mechanism of depth control using a canvas kite were also discussed with the necessity of more basic data for the development and design of the depth control system. ...|$|E

Nine {{series of}} vertically-stratified {{zooplankton}} tows {{were made with}} a closing net at a single station in southern Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, between 31 August 1973 and 11 April 1974. Sampling periods occupied from 12 to 26 hours, with tows usually taken at about 3 m intervals between the surface and a maximum depth of 10 m. A total of 21, 254 fish larvae of 49 kinds was collected. Six species were abundant: Foa brachygrammus, Omobranchus elongatus, Callionymus decoratus, Caranx mate, Stolephorus purpureus, and Abudefduf abdominalis. Blennius sp. and Gnathanodon speciosus were commonly taken in small numbers. These common larvae displayed five "distribution patterns: 1. F. brachygrammus and the smallest S. purpureus were most abundant near the surface at night and at depths below 4 m during the day; 2. C. mate and G. speciosus were dispersed throughout the water column at night and usually most abundant between 5 m and 6 m depth during the day; 3. Blennius sp., o. elongatus, and A. abdominalis were dispersed throughout the water column at night and concentrated near the surface during the day; 4. the larger ~. purpureus maintained a level of maximum abundance below 6 m day and night; 5. C. decoratus was taken at all depths at all times. Patterns 1, 2, and 3 are shown to be light-related. Pattern 4 is shown to be partially attributable to avoidance of the <b>towed</b> <b>net</b> by S. purpureus larvae larger than about 6 mm, and a feeding-related migration is proposed to account for pattern 5. The observed patterns are analogous to those shown for fish larvae in the open ocean on scales of from 50 m to 200 m.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} were performed during February 1974 with mixed zooplankton collected with. 33 -mm mesh {{in the southern}} basin of Kaneohe Bay. The mean specific excretion rates multiplied by the estimated average standing stocks of the animals gave estimates of addition to the bay waters of ammonia, phosphate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and dissolved organic phosphorus of 38. 6, 4. 0, 23. 7, and 3. 2 ng-at/liter/day, respectively. The specific excretion rates were not significantly affected by the concentrations of animals in experimental vessels, by the estimated concentrations of food in the environment {{on the days of}} the experiments, nor by incubation periods of up to 4. 5 hours. The rates are comparable to those obtained from zooplankton of this general size in environments that have rather different temperature and food levels, indicating that size-dependent metabolic rates are the major determinant of specific excretion rates, although feeding and temperature can affect the results of experiments. Two collecting devices, a conical net and a purse seine made of the same plankton mesh, were used to assess possible effects of capture on the results. The animals from the net hauls excreted phosphate more slowly and dissolved organic nitrogen more rapidly than did those from the seine catches, possibly {{as a result of the}} greater initial crowding of animals in the cod-end jar of the <b>towed</b> <b>net.</b> There was no evidence that animals were damaged by collection and no observable effect of initial shock. Although principally carnivorous, the animals in these experiments (60 to 70 percent Sagitta) processed dietary nitrogen and phosphorus in a way similar to that of the mainly herbivorous Calanus: they constructed body tissue that was richer in nitrogen relative to phosphorus than was their food and they excreted solutes that were relatively poorer in nitrogen than was their food...|$|E

40|$|Three new {{zooplankton}} nets {{have been}} designed to enable improved collection of zooplankters from ice-covered waters. These nets also enable quantitative sampling of species not adequately sampled by other methods. The first net is a vertical <b>tow</b> <b>net</b> which can be folded like an umbrella to pass through a small ice hole (10 cm). This 2 ̆ 7 Umbrella Net 2 ̆ 7 takes an integrated sample of zoo-plankton from all sample depths. The second net is a collapsible free-fall net designed to collect mobile zooplankters capable of avoiding <b>towed</b> <b>nets.</b> This was the only net used which was capable of collecting all furcilia stages of Euphausia crystallorophias from Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. The third net is a diver-operated push net designed to collect zooplankters in the top 15 cm of the under-ice water column. Because of the high standing crop of phytoplankton at and near the under-ice surface at particular times of the year, some species of zooplankton tend to congregate there. These species, particularly Paralabidocera antarctica, were collected in great abundance using the push net, but were rare in samples collected by other methods...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the fish}} escape {{behaviour}} through bycatch reduction devices {{is the cornerstone}} of their application as technical conservation measures. To evaluate square meshes and sorting grids as successful size-selective bycatch reduction devices in finfish trawls, we conducted a simulated trawling experiment to assess the effects of illumination, towing speed and mesh or grid orientation on the escape behaviour of undersized fish through square meshes and rigid grids. Juvenile masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) with average body length 13 cm were used as the experimental fish. A speed-controllable motor was used to tow the framed net in a circular water tank. An infrared CCD (charge-coupled devices) camera fixed to the <b>towed</b> <b>net</b> by means of a rotary connector was used to observe fish behaviour. In contrast to the active escape seen under lighted conditions, there was no active voluntary escape under dark conditions. As a result, no fish escaped through parallel and backward-sloping meshes, and only 13 % of fish escaped through the forward-sloping meshes when the towing speed was increased. On the other hand, the encounter probability and passive escape through the longer openings in the backward-sloping grid increased under the dark condition, resulting in the highest escape ratio. This increased from 67 to 87 % on increasing the towing speed from 1 to 1. 5 knots, and shortened the swimming time before escaping from 5 to 1. 5 min (the highest escape ratio and the shortest swimming time before escaping under the dark condition). Frame-by-frame analysis of some escape events demonstrated easy, passive fish escape through the grids with no change in the normal swimming direction. The results support the backward-sloping grid as an efficient bycatch-reduction device, especially in demersal trawling when placed well ahead of the codend, working in the dark at high towing speeds...|$|E
40|$|Planktic foraminiferal faunas from {{different}} environments in the Arabian Sea were size fractionated using 14 sieves with meshes between 100 and 710 μm, {{to assess the}} effect of the sieve mesh size cut off level on the faunal composition and to determine the size frequency distribution of individual species. Nine samples from a plankton pump and a <b>towed</b> <b>net,</b> a sediment trap, a box-core and a piston core were selected, to cover living and settling flux faunas as well as fossil faunas from the sediment. In living faunas, most species show an exponential size frequency distribution, with highest numbers in the finest interval of the size spectrum. In sediment trap and core samples, individual species size frequency distributions may consist of: (1) an exponential distribution of relatively small pre-adult specimens; (2) a Gaussian-shaped distribution of larger specimens, which may be classified as adult or terminal; or (3) a combination of both. The distributions are separated using a best fit technique. The composition of the total planktic foraminiferal fauna strongly changes along the size spectrum. Dominant taxa in > 355 μm fractions are Orbulina universa, Globorotalia menardii, Globorotalia tumida, Globigerinella siphonifera and Globigerinoides sacculifer, in 125 - 355 μm fractions Globigerina bulloides, Globigerinoides ruber, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Globigerinita glutinata, and in 100 μm) is present in the 100 - 125 μm fraction and 1 - 6 % is larger than 250 μm. In samples representing a settling flux (sediment trap and sediment samples) 29 - 57 % of the fauna is present in the 100 - 125 μm fraction, while 6 - 23 % is larger than 250 μm. Size frequency distributions of the dextral Neogloboquadrina complex (= Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma + P-D intergrades) show a bimodal pattern; a smaller peak reflecting dextral Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, and a larger peak of adult Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. By applying a best fit technique to the data, the two species may be separated from each other. In size fractions larger than 150 μm most species have reached the adult stage of ontogeny and we recommend this mesh size for standard faunal analysis. In addition, sieve mesh sizes of 125 and 250 μm have to be used to obtain a reliable estimate of the abundance of small and large species, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{dynamics}} in the permanently open Kowie Estuary, {{in the warm}} temperate region of South Africa was investigated. The composition, abundance, distribution and seasonality of larval fishes were studied over a two year period between 2004 and 2006. Additionally, tidal exchange of ichthyoplankton {{and the use of}} frontal zones in the mouth region of the estuary were also explored between 2008 and 2009. Temporal and spatial trends in occurrence of larval fishes within the estuary and associated marina were obtained from data collected seasonally using boat-based plankton netting at 14 sampling stations {{along the length of the}} estuary. A total of 11 128 larval fishes were collected, representing 23 families and 38 taxa. Clupeidae and Gobiidae were the dominant fish families, contributing 47. 0 % and 24. 7 % respectively to the total catch. Estuarine resident species dominated the overall catch (91 %). A notable absence of older stage larvae and early juveniles characterised the artificial channels of the marina and estuary mouth region. This was attributed to the absence of a shallow, marginal water habitat typical of successful estuarine nursery areas. Tidal exchange of larval fishes was investigated in the Kowie Estuary using a new technique. A set of drifting light traps were set repetitively on the ebb and flood tide every second night for two consecutive 14 day periods during the peak estuarine recruitment period. A total of 553 larval fishes were caught during the study, representing nine families and 26 species. Blenniidae and Clupeidae dominated the catches. Family and species occurrence changed with tide state. Species richness (d) and diversity (H’) varied with tide and was highest on flood tides. Estuary-dependent species, such as Omobranchus woodii were more dominant on flood tides, whilst larvae of marine-spawned species, such as Sardinops sagax, were dominant on the ebb tide. Light trap catches yielded a different composition in terms of development stage / size and species, when compared to <b>towed</b> <b>net</b> studies. Towed plankton nets were again used to study the shear fronts that characterise the mouth region of the canalised Kowie Estuary. It was hypothesised that the convergence zone of the front provides feeding opportunities for ichthyoplankton. Ichthyoplankton, zooplankton and phytoplankton was collected from within and immediately outside of the convergence zone during frontal conditions. Species specific distribution trends emerged from this study. Postflexion larvae and early juvenile stages of the estuary dependent Mugilidae were only present in the foam line of the convergence zones. Some known predators of ichthyoplankton were also present in slightly higher numbers in the convergence zone (isopods) while other predators such as mysid shrimps, chaetognaths and cnidarians were more abundant out of the convergence zone. It appears that these zones may provide access to temporary food patches in the lower estuary but will be accompanied by a trade-off with increased isopod predators. The Kowie Estuary is a heavily impacted system and lack of adequate freshwater supply; artificial channelling and pollution ultimately have a negative impact of the success of this system as a nursery area. Rehabilitation of marginal areas in the lower estuary and marina is suggested as remedial action to re-establish the integrity of the nursery function this system could offer...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 During {{the summers}} of 1967 and 1968 the {{horizontal}} distribution and did vertical migrations of zooplankton were studied within the unique environment of Crater Lake. Sampling of the horizontal distribution {{was done by}} <b>towing</b> plankton <b>nets</b> vertically in different locations. The vertical distribution was sampled by towing at different depths with a standard <b>tow</b> <b>net</b> and Miller samplers. During both summers, the greatest numbers of zooplankton were sampled in late August. Bosmina longispina was the most numerous zooplankter, while Daphnia pulex, insignificant in 1967, increased in abundance during 1968. The horizontal distribution of B. longispina was clumped, being consistently more abundant in some locations than others. D. pulex had a random, or near-uniform, distribution. Vertical migrations were not consistent and seem to occur only during certain times of the year. The depth of the maximum concentration of B. longispina was found to vary between distances of 12. 5 and 25 m, and was located at depths of 75 to 50 m {{during the day and}} between 50 to 37. 5 m at night. A few B. longispina, however, did migrate to the surface at night. On August 28 and 29, 1968, the entire adult population of D. pulex migrated from 62. 5 m during the day to the surface at night. This migration appears to have reproductive advantages. Prior to this time, only a nocturnal scattering of {{a small portion of the}} total population of D. pulex occurred. Various ideas are given as to why these different migrations occurred, but based on the information that is presently available, any direct relationships between the variations of vertical migrations and environmental factors are difficult to make...|$|R
