40|$|Part 3 : Access Control, Trust and Identity ManagementInternational audienceIn this paper, a data {{structure}} to enhance remote authentication is proposed generalizing {{the concept of}} ISO/IEC 24761. Current technologies do not provide sufficient information on products which {{are used in the}} authentication process at the Claimant to the Verifier. As a result, the Verifier cannot sufficiently distinguish the authentication result executed with a <b>trusted</b> <b>product</b> from that without a <b>trusted</b> <b>product.</b> The difference is made clear if an evidence data of the execution of authentication process at the Claimant is generated by the <b>trusted</b> <b>product</b> and used for verification by the Verifier.

40|$|FOREWORD The <b>Trusted</b> <b>Product</b> Evaluation Questionnaire is {{the latest}} in a series of {{technical}} documents that are being published by the National Computer Security Center under the Technical Guidelines Programs. It is the goal of the Technical Guidelines Program to assure that each process in the <b>Trusted</b> <b>Product</b> Evaluation Program and the features of the Department of Defense Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria will be discussed in detail and provide the proper interpretations with specific guidance. These publications are designed to provide insight to the Department of Defense Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria requirements for the computer security vendor and developer, as well as the technical evaluator. The specific questions in the <b>Trusted</b> <b>Product</b> Evaluation Questionnaire provide a set of good practices related to necessary system security and system security documentation. This questionnaire has been written to help the vendor understand what technical information is required concerning the system for a product evaluation. From the vendor's responses, the evaluator may obtain an understanding of the security of the system applying for evaluation. As the Director, National Computer Security Center, I invite your recommendations for revision to this technical guideline. We plan to review this document when the need arises...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Indonesian Navy {{recognized the need}} for a computer security program over ten years ago. They published their first computer security regulation in 1981. But that regulation is now obsolete because of the advances in technology and the increased availability of powerful computer systems. As computer systems become bigger, more complicated, easier to use, more interconnected, and more important, they become more vulnerable to hackers, terrorist, and disgruntled employees. This thesis demonstrates {{the need for a}}n updated computer security regulation. To add in meeting that need, the thesis proposes a security program for the Indonesian Navy that is based on the multilevel trusted computer criteria published by the NCSC in the 'Orange Book', the Canadian <b>Trusted</b> <b>Product</b> Evaluation Criteria and ITSEC. The proposed program includes additional regulations concerning physical security, data security, integrity and availability, and recommended trusted evaluation guide[URL] Indonesian Nav...|$|E

We used 327 observations collected from an international survey distributed to students in the U. S., Mexico and Indonesia as proxy of consumers’ view. Our results demonstrate that the consumer’s general predisposition toward trust, social normative pressure, {{and the presence of}} factors that facilitate consumer’s perceptions to perform trust behavior significantly increase the consumer’s intention to <b>trust</b> sustainable <b>product</b> and certification information. Although we found some country variations in terms of the propensity to <b>trust</b> <b>product</b> information, the differences have no impact on the hypotheses of the theory of planned behavior. Our findings provide suggestive evidence of the instrumental roles of ICTs to facilitate sustainable development by enabling positive changes in consumer behavior, specifically in supporting sustainable consumption...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the SSE-CMM program in 1993, there have been some misconceptions within the computer security and evaluation communities regarding its intended purpose. Evaluators in particular have expressed strong resistance to this effort due to the perception that the SSE-CMM is intended to replace evaluated assurance with developmental assurance. That has not and never will be the case. The SSE-CMM efforts can greatly enhance government, corporate, developer, user and integrator knowledge of security in general. As such, the efforts of the SSE-CMM development team are intended to provide significantly improved input to system developers (internal assessments) and the higher level assurance activities (e. g. evaluations, certification, accreditation) efforts (third party assessments). To best address the needs of our customers, the efforts of SSE-CMM and other assurance efforts must grow to complement each other. It will take focused effort from the security community and developmental assurance organizations, as well as industry partners to achieve this goal. Evaluated assurance, provided by programs like the <b>Trusted</b> <b>Product</b> Evaluation Program (TPEP), has become widely accepted throughout the computer security industry. However, as the state of technology has advanced, the current process and methodology used by the evaluatio...|$|E
40|$|The DREAM Lesson Plan APP, {{developed}} by previous researchers of CSUSM aimed {{to provide a}} process for approved K- 12 teachers to use when creating lessons. They set out to incorporate a data server, which would allow the application to acquire and post all necessary data for creating lesson plans. Their goal was to develop an application that would be fully user friendly, intuitive and save memory space; however, the application still allowed unverified users to create lesson plans, undermining the Dream institute???s goal of providing proper direction to teachers. A method {{to keep track of}} lessons created by an individual teacher was paramount in evaluating a teacher???s lesson. The goal of this project was to continue development of the Dream Institute application on the iPad platform and enhance the user experience as well as add user authentication to lessons they create. These authentication measures would ensure reliability of lessons created by teachers. The authentication methods utilized in this application involve encryption of personal information and are comparable to those used in online electronic transactions involving secret Internet banking and electronic voting.
