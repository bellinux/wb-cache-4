5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>and</b> the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas {{was added to the}} back of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>and</b> the three layers were glued together.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{gave his}} 1889 Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey to Dr Rey. The {{physician}} was not fond of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> {{used it to}} repair a chicken coop, then gave it away. In 2016, the portrait was housed at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and estimated to be worth over $50million.|$|E
5|$|After Gilchriese {{closed his}} museum, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> other {{contents}} of the museum were sold at auction by John's Western Gallery of San Francisco. The estimated auction price for the painting had been $200,000 to $300,000; the final sale price on June 25, 2004 was $40,250. It was put up for auction again on June 14, 2014 with an estimated selling price of $40,000–$60,000 but failed to sell.|$|E

5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>and</b> his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Art Institute Board met the {{day after}} the {{incident}} and agreed not to display Mirth & Girth any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers. After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>and</b> had left it {{leaning against the wall}} for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{left-hand}} panel shows {{a fighter}} plane firing a rocket that, in the right-hand panel, hits a second plane which explodes in flames. Lichtenstein conceived the image from several comic-book panels. He transformed his primary source, a panel from a 1962 war comic book, by presenting it as a diptych while altering {{the relationship of}} the graphical and narrative elements. Whaam! is regarded for the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels. The painting's title is integral to the action and impact of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>and</b> displayed in large onomatopoeia in the right panel.|$|E

5|$|Visitors are {{encouraged}} to view the house from the outside and have their photo taken—in fact, the visitors center provides many sizes of similar aprons and jackets worn by the original painting's models. The adjacent American Gothic House Center, completed in 2007, contains exhibits about the painting, artist Grant Wood, and the community around the house. Each June, the city of Eldon holds its Gothic Days festival, a celebration of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> rural life in Eldon in the 1930s. Starting in 2015, tours began in {{the first floor of}} the home. The Gothic House is not handicap accessible.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publishing}} {{of the first}} Swedish ecclesiastical history in 1642, the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> the historical details surrounding it found a new path to follow. Relying on a publication from 1620, the sun dogs {{are said to have}} appeared first to King John III (1537–1592) on his deathbed - the painting subsequently being produced by the papist-friendly king in order to save the souls of the Protestant kingdom - and a second time before King Gustavus Adolphus shortly before his death at the Battle of Lützen in 1632.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E

5|$|Adrift is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Lucius J. Henderson. The film depicts {{a story of a}} young artist whose lack of success leads him to attempt suicide. Before he can carry out the act, his daughter follows and stops him. He confesses to his wife and she thanks her child, providing the inspiration for the artist to complete a great painting. It brings him success and he grows distant from his wife and becomes interested in another woman whom he was commissioned by. Once again saved by his daughters actions, whose crying moves the woman to break off the relationship with the artist. The artist destroys <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> learns a moral lesson.|$|E
5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the {{following}} day, the reporter revealed an additional lure {{he had brought}} with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call {{him as soon as}} he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> uniform were fakes.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>and</b> that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E

30|$|The {{condition}} of <b>the</b> textile, <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> paint-textile interfaces including presence of soiling, creasing, splits and abrasion were documented based on visual and low-level microscopy. The differences in flexibilities between <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> <b>and</b> unpainted areas were evident. Paint deformation resulting from previous storage around the narrow banner pole <b>and</b> areas of <b>paint</b> loss associated with flexing and creasing are evident (Fig.  2 c, d). Some of these distortions {{may be the}} result of different flexibilities of the materials but also different responses to environmental conditions between <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> <b>and</b> unpainted areas. This damage is typical for banners [6].|$|R
5|$|It {{belonged to}} Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, {{founder of the}} Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin. That April, the Duveen Brothers, less {{affected}} by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually {{had to go through}} the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 1994, {{the city}} and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against {{the city and}} Superintendent LeRoy Martin. In return, the city of Chicago agreed to pay Nelson and the ACLU $95,000 (1994, $138,000 in 2008) for damage to <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> to issue police {{procedures}} about what materials protected by the First Amendment may be seized. The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling. Left unresolved were {{the hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of legal fees owed to lawyers defending Tillman, Rush and Streeter; by September 1994, $200,000 (1994, $292,000 in 2008) in fees were owed by Tillman alone. Earlier in the year, the City Council's Finance Committee voted against paying for the aldermen's legal fees. The vote split along racial lines, 12 to 8.|$|E
5|$|The art {{historian}} Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that {{the painting is}} informed by the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet. She concedes {{that there is no}} documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time Happy Brothers was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850–51 alongside The Stone Breakers and A Burial At Ornans.|$|E
