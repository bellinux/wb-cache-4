Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
2500|$|In February 1982, Iraq {{was removed}} from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the {{transfer}} of dual-use technology to that country. According to investigative journalist Alan Friedman, Secretary of State Alexander Haig was [...] "upset at the fact that the decision had been made at the White House, even though the State Department was responsible for the list." [...] "I was not consulted," [...] Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82—seeking [...] "a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East"—and in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: [...] "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." [...] Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was [...] "the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq," [...] and sparked a short-lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetton to [...] "get the hell out of Iraq," [...] but Iraqi military intelligence—"having already drooled over it and having said repeatedly how valuable it was"—subsequently informed Twetton [...] "we'll continue <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> information, and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way." [...] Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984. [...] "On November 26, 1984, Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations." ...|$|E

50|$|Erving Goffman's Self Presentation {{is a key}} {{theory that}} explores the way {{people want to be}} seen and how people are {{perceived}} by their peers. Goffman, uses the term Dramaturgy as a component to his theory of self-presentation. This term refers <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own persona as a drama, treating your actions as an actor in a play. One can control how he or she is viewed by their peers and in cases of celebrities or athletes, can build a personal brand through utilizing what they present to their publics using various social media outlets. Self-presentation theory and personal branding go hand and hand, we see celebrities and athletes building a particular brand, or persona over with the use of twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Building a personal brand {{is a big part of}} a celebrity's life, and it can help them spread awareness and also provide an outlet to connect with their fans/supporters. This is made possible through the use of social media and the ability of the person <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> build a personal brand to make their messages heard. The theory of self-presentation <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> how people <b>look</b> <b>to</b> create an identity for themselves that they would like to be seen as by their peers or in the public eye. This is what Goffman call's the 'front stage'.|$|R
