It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

The periodical also ranked it 7th on their 25 Best Romantic Movies of the Past 25 Years list and #3 on their Top 25 Modern Romances list.

Finn (Cory Monteith) tells Rachel (Lea Michele) that all he wants for Christmas is her. Rachel (Lea Michele) replies that he is also all she wants, but gives Finn (Cory Monteith) {{a long list of}} Christmas present suggestions. Her dialogue, [...] "All I want is what I have coming <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>All</b> I want is my fair share" [...] is a verbatim homage to Sally's Christmas list scene with Charlie Brown in the Christmas classic, A Charlie Brown Christmas. Just as Charlie Brown is with Sally, Finn is appalled by how much Rachel wants, though she assures him that five of the items are enough. When she later hints that an early gift would not be amiss, he surprises her with the donation of a sow in her name to needy Africans. Rachel is unhappy, reminds Finn that she is a vegan, and recommends that he stick to her list to avoid embarrassment, while pointedly mentioning earrings.|$|E

"Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a very natural way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>All</b> of Taylor's world is very far away from my culture, but I saw something in her that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't want to go for a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E

He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E

On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!'

2500|$|Tommy Jones, {{a former}} member of the Royal Military Police special {{investigations}} branch, became well known as a guide for Western journalists and visitors to the inner German border. Although he escorted around 4,000-5,000 visitors a year along the border, he averred that he [...] "never [...] frustrated. It is important to show people this border. It is impossible to imagine it or to describe it." [...] Jones arrived in Germany in 1945 during the British advance to the Elbe in the closing months of the Second World War and remained there for the next 45 years. He joined the BFS in 1960, moved to Helmstedt in 1974 and became the head of the BFS in 1983, by which time it had only four personnel left. In January 1990, he was awarded an MBE and retired to become a Chelsea Pensioner. His departure was noted not just by the West Germans with whom he had worked for so long, but by the East German border guards as well; as he put it, [...] "For 16 years at Helmstedt, the East German border guards never spoke <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> <b>All</b> they did was take pictures of me from behind bushes.
