25|$|Disposal methods vary {{by country}} and locale, but common methods of {{disposal}} are either by <b>truck</b> <b>service</b> or, in the United States, by disposal of sharps through the mail. <b>Truck</b> <b>service</b> involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often medical waste, {{at the point}} of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a <b>truck</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the freight}} {{transport}} was small. During the war, transport increased many-fold, particularly because of export of lumber. [...] In 1966, a spur was built {{just south of}} Palmafoss to Voss Cementvarefabrikk. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, the line was transporting [...] During the late 1970s, the amount of transport fel dramatically, and reached [...] in 1980. Nearly half of this was import of lumber to three sawmills and manufacturing companies. In 1972, Linjegods established a daily scheduled <b>truck</b> <b>service</b> to Granvin. Although Linjegods used train to and from Voss, the service from Voss to Granvin was operated parallel to the railway. In 1975, Tollpost Globe also established a similar service between Voss and Granvin. During the late 1970s, the manufacturer Bjølvefossen experienced a large drop in the demand of ferroalloys, reducing production—and thus transport on the line—by [...] Another issue for the line was that it has a permitted axle load of only this either prehibited optimal wagon weights on the main lines, or causing transshipment at Voss, both causing increased costs. In 1977, the average distance for cargo shipped from the Hardanger Line was [...] by rail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined We {{found that}} a large Swedish grocery {{retailer}} was missing a structured approach for deciding on contract type when procuring <b>trucking</b> <b>services</b> in shipper-forwarder relationships. In this context, we identified four contract types: dedicated services, periodical services, truckload services, and less-than-truckload services. From previous literature, we found that trucking costs, utilization, and coordination costs impacted prices when tendering for <b>trucking</b> <b>services.</b> Thus, {{the purpose of this}} article is to compare the four contract types for <b>trucking</b> <b>services</b> based on <b>trucking</b> <b>service</b> costs, which includes a tradeoff between utilization and coordination costs. Using an applied research project, we worked together with the grocery retailer to compare contract types. Our results show that it is possible to compare contract type using trucking costs, utilization, and coordination costs associated with each contract type...|$|R
