25|$|SH-87 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US-259 near the unincorporated community of Harris, about 1 mile (1.6km) from the Red River. SH-87 heads east from here, proceeding along many curves. The highway is two-lane for its entire length, {{and much of}} it is very narrow with no shoulders (though a short stretch of highway that was realigned to approach a new girder bridge that replaced an old <b>through</b> <b>truss</b> bridge was built with shoulders). The highway crosses no major rivers, but does bridge Walnut Bayou. SH-87 ends at the Arkansas state line, where it becomes Arkansas Highway 108.|$|E
25|$|Dresser Bridge The current {{bridge is}} a four-span structure, which {{features}} two early U.S. examples of riveted Warren <b>through</b> <b>truss</b> structures. The current superstructure was manufactured in 1906 by the American Bridge Company {{to replace the}} second wood truss at this location, which had been constructed in 1893. The original bridge at this location was completed in 1866 and consisted of two wooden Howe trusses. The original coursed-ashlar sandstone piers from 1865-66 are still in use and have been supplemented by concrete piers from 1893 and 1906. The bridge consists of two 125ft. through Warren trusses and two 60ft. deck plate girder spans with one {{at each end of}} the bridge. The abutments and piers are angled parallel to the course of the river below and are not perpendicular to the railroadâ€™s alignment. As a result, the bridge spans are laterally offset from one another.|$|E
50|$|The swing span has a {{humpback}} truss, {{while the}} two adjoining spans are flat-top fixed <b>through</b> <b>trusses.</b> Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses this bridge.|$|R

25|$|At {{the west}} end of Liberty Road, the highway from Frederick to Libertytown was paved in macadam by 1921. This highway was {{originally}} marked as MD 31 when the Maryland State Roads Commission first numbered state highways in 1927. The portion of MD 31 west of Libertytown became an extension of MD 26 by 1933. The gap between Eldersburg and Libertytown was gradually constructed as a concrete road. The highway was constructed from Eldersburg to Dorsey Crossroads, the site of the modern MD 97 junction, by 1923. MD 26 was extended through Winfield in 1924 and 1925. The concrete road was extended to just east of Taylorsville in 1928, the same year a new section of the highway was paved through Unionville. The road to Taylorsville was completed and the Unionville concrete road was extended east in 1930. The final sections of MD 26 between Baltimore and Frederick were completed in 1933, the same year a steel <b>through</b> <b>truss</b> bridge was constructed over the Monocacy River to replace the vulnerable old bridge at Ceresville.|$|E
25|$|MD 26 {{begins at}} a partial trumpet {{interchange}} with US 15 (Catoctin Mountain Highway) {{on the north}} side of the city of Frederick. There is no access from southbound US 15 to eastbound MD 26. MD 26 heads east as a four-lane divided highway through a mixed commercial and industrial area. The state highway has an intersection with Wormans Mill Road and Routzhan Way and a directional intersection with the northern end of Market Street that allows access to and from MD 26 east. The first intersection, which was formerly MD 355, provides the missing movements from the Market Street intersection. MD 26 intersects Monocacy Boulevard, a partial circumferential highway of Frederick, and passes between a pair of residential subdivisions before crossing the Monocacy River on a pair of dissimilar bridges, the westbound one a <b>through</b> <b>truss</b> bridge. East of the river, the state highway meets the southern end of MD 194 (Woodsboro Pike) at the hamlet of Ceresville. The divided highway continues north as MD 194 toward Woodsboro and MD 26 turns east onto a two-lane road.|$|E
25|$|MD 214 intersects Queen Anne Bridge Road, {{which leads}} to the {{abandoned}} Queen Anne Bridge and the historic home Hazelwood, just west of its steel <b>through</b> <b>truss</b> bridge across the Patuxent River at the Prince George'sAnne Arundel county line. The highway meets the southern end of MD 424 (Davidsonville Road) in the Davidsonville Historic District. MD 214 intersects Riva Road and passes the historic home Summer Hill on its way to Edgewater. The highway gains a second lane westbound at Pike Ridge Road, which is unsigned MD 214A. The route gains a second eastbound lane and a median just west of its intersection with MD 2 (Solomons Island Road). MD 214 veers southeast and becomes undivided at Stepneys Lane and meets the southern end of MD 253 (Mayo Road) opposite South River High School, then drops to two lanes ahead of its intersection with MD 468 (Muddy Creek Road). MD 214 continues east through the community of Selby-on-the-Bay, where it passes the entrance to Camp Letts and the historic home Gresham. The highway passes through Mayo and its name changes to Beverley Avenue on the northern edge of Beverley Beach. MD 214 curves east onto Grande View Avenue and reaches its eastern terminus at a gate just east of Oakford Avenue.|$|E
