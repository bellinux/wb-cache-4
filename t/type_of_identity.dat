Gee explains this idea further by stating, “N-identities must always gain their force as identities through the work of institutions, discourse and dialogue, or affinity groups, that is, the very forces that constitute our other perspectives on identity” (p.102).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} of ethnographic data collected by participant observation of the Anti-Double Rent Movement in Hong Kong and 16 unstructured interviews of its participant between the period March 1993 and March 1994. Synthesizing the theory of Snow (et. al. 1986), Melucci (1988) as well as Klandermans (1992) on frame alignment and identity construction, and adopting the analysis tools employed by Snow and Anderson (1992) and Hunt and Benford (1994), this paper seeks to demonstrated how participants of the Anti-Double Rent Movement constructed a collective identity as victims and resisted the label of being political applied {{to them by the}} mass media. Four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> talk among the participants of the Anti-Double Rent Movement have been identified in this paper, namely, the HORROR STORIES, NOSTALGIC TALES, HOI FONG NGAU STORIES, as well as the ENLIGHTENMENT STORIES. Organized around common themes, different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> talk had demonstrated how protestors defined themselves as victims instead of the beneficiaries in the public housing programme in Hong Kong, as well as defined the Hong Kong Government and the Housing Authority as greedy merchants disguised as benefactor. The four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> talk also carried an important function of mobilizing participants and extending the pool of potential participants in the Anti-Double Rent Movement...|$|R
40|$|In {{three studies}} we {{examined}} the experience and management of conflict between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>identities.</b> Participants described a conflict between pairs of role, relational, or social identities before rating the experience (i. e., magnitude, stress, and growth) and management of conflict on a newly developed scale assessing four strategies: reconciliation, where identities are integrated, realignment, where one identity is chosen over another, retreat, where both identities are avoided, and reflection, where fit (with others, situation) determines identity selection. In general, the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> mattered for conflict management but not its experience: Magnitude and growth did not differ, however, stress was greater for role identity conflicts (Study 3 only) and participants endorsed the use of more realignment for role conflicts (Study 2) and more retreat for relational conflicts (Study 3) relative to other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> conflicts. Furthermore, findings suggested that the perceived flexibility <b>of</b> <b>identities,</b> not their importance or valence, were associated with realignment and retreat for roles and with retreat for relationships. Experiencing conflicts between multiple identities leaves people similarly torn, but multiple roles and relationships may be differentially shorn to manage conflict...|$|R

50|$|Maddi goes on {{to outline}} two {{distinct}} personality types, based on how people identify or see themselves. The premorbid personality sees him- or herself in fairly simple terms, {{as nothing more than}} “a player of social roles and an embodiment of biological needs.” This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> thus stresses qualities that are the least unique for him or her as opposed to other species (biological needs) and to other people (social roles). According to Maddi, people with a premorbid identity can continue with their life {{for a long time and}} ostensibly feel adequate and reasonably successful. However, this personality type is also prone to be precipitated into a state of chronic existential neurosis under conditions of stress. This existential neurosis is characterized by the belief that one’s life is meaningless, by feelings of apathy and boredom, and by a lack of selectivity in actions - a sense that one’s activities are not chosen.|$|E

It took three months to fix the problem, when it occurred.
