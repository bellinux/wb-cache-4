5000|$|On June 28, 1933 I {{departed}} from the Municipal Airport, Kansas City, Missouri, flying Flamingo NC 9489. Ship was functioning properly throughout the entire trip until I reached the vicinity of Goodland, Kansas. While flying {{at an altitude of}} approximately two thousand feet I suddenly discovered fire which seemed to originate around the rear portion of the motor section and which permitted flames and fumes to enter through the floor boards into the pilot's cockpit. I immediately cut the throttle and switch and turned off the right hand gas tank. It was impossible to close the left hand gas <b>tank</b> <b>connection</b> due to the flames around that portion. I attempted to smother the flames in the cockpit by the use of a fire extinguisher. I lowered both windows in the pilot's cockpit and placed the ship in a nose high side slip which partly cleared the fumes and kept most of the flames out of the cockpit. A normal three point landing was made in a corn field approximately three miles east of the Municipal Airport at Goodland, Kansas. I left the ship by the front exit and after having removed the passengers, I then removed the mail and luggage {{with the exception of a}} small amount of personal effects contained in the pilot's cockpit. Contained in the luggage compartment there was approximately 124 pounds of express which was removed.|$|E

This scenario was not recommended because it would quickly drain parts of the water supply. The second scenario consisted in adding connecting pipes between subsystems of high pressure and those of low pressure. It was recommended because it would increase the flow rate of low and medium supply taps. For the third scenario, areas of the camp without easy access to water were defined by using the result of mapping the current system and the population distribution in a Graphical Information System software. (cont.) These new taps were successful in providing water to these areas without significantly affecting the rest of the system. An additional recommendation for increasing the water supply in the camp was found from analyzing tank level: because tanks would not drain {{by the end of the}} distribution period, it was recommended that the period of water supply be increased from 3 hour periods to 4 1 / 2 hours. Further study is recommended for improving the elevation accuracy of the model, running more calibration studies and running an optimization model for maximizing water supply. by Navid Rahimi.

Using the data provided by Yarra Valley Water the water savings from different tank' sizes were calculated from the households who installed the rainwater tanks and received rebates. The results revealed that the 4400 households used less water than those that received government rebates before the installation of rainwater tanks but after the installation their water usage surpassed those that installed rainwater tanks. The results also show that rainwater tank sizes with indoor plumbing have longer payback period than those solely for outdoor purposes due to higher capital and operating costs even with higher rebates from the government...|$|R

40|$|Use of utilities, such as {{steam and}} cooling water, {{is very common}} at {{industrial}} sites. Utilities are often shared between several production areas, and a disturbance in the supply of a utility is therefore likely to affect {{a large part of}} the production site, and cause great loss of revenue.

The method concerns identifying disturbances in utilities, estimating the loss of revenue due to such disturbances, and finding strategies for reducing the loss. A model of the production site is needed to complete all steps of the method.

Department of Energy {{announced}} it will be hosting an international public competition called the Solar Decathlon in Irvine, CA during October 2015 to showcase high-efficiency houses. Cal Poly students created a team â Solar Cal Poly â to participate. Three mechanical engineering students joined the team {{to work on the}} plumbing section of the competition. The team completed multiple iterations and designs of the plumbing system within the Solar Cal Poly house as the house was designed and redesigned. The construction and final design of the plumbing system will be decided by the construction crew and architecture team within Solar Cal Poly. The mechanical engineering design was selected with the intent to satisfy architecture design needs. There are cold and hot water PEX supply systems, a code-compliant sprinkler system, and black and grey ABS waste systems designed for easy hookup after transport to Irvine, CA. In addition to architectural design needs, structural integrity, ease of assembly, safety, durability, head loss, building code, and integration with other systems were all considered {{in the design of the}} system. Of particular importance was integration with the Solar Cal Poly water systems team. This team dictated use of the grey water captured by the plumbing system, and directly coordinated supply conditions and requirements with our team. A black-grey connection valve was designed for the plumbing system to easily divert water away from water systems as necessary. Sewage pumps were designed into the system to allow flow into grey water and septic tanks above grade. The entire system was designed for easy on-site hook up.

40|$|A {{system for}} continuous, rapid {{deaeration}} of hydraulic oil {{has been built}} to replace a prior system that effected deaeration more slowly in a cyclic pressure/ vacuum process. Such systems are needed because (1) hydraulic oil has an affinity for air, typically containing between 10 and 15 volume percent of air and (2) in the original application for which these systems were built, there is a requirement to keep the proportion of dissolved air below 1 volume percent because a greater proportion can lead to pump cavitation and excessive softness in hydraulic-actuator force-versus-displacement characteristics. In addition to overcoming several deficiencies of the prior deaeration system, the present system removes water from the oil. The system (see figure) includes a pump that continuously circulates oil {{at a rate of}} 10 gal/min (38 L/min) between an 80 -gal (303 -L) airless reservoir and a tank containing a vacuum. When the circulation pump is started, oil is pumped, at a pressure of 120 psi (827 kPa), through a venturi tube below the <b>tank</b> with a <b>connection</b> to a stand-pipe in the tank. This action draws oil out of the tank via the standpipe. At the same time, oil is sprayed into the tank in a fine mist, thereby exposing a large amount of oil to the vacuum. When the oil level in the tank falls below the lower of two level switches, a vacuum pump is started, drawing a hard vacuum on the tank through a trap that collects any oil and water entrained in the airflow. When the oil level rises above higher of the two level switches or when the system is shut down, a solenoid valve between the tank and the vacuum pump is closed to prevent suction of oil into the vacuum pump. Critical requirements that the system is designed to satisfy include the following: 1) The circulation pump must have sufficient volume and pressure to operate the venturi tube and spray nozzles. 2) The venturi tube must be sized to empty the tank (except for the oil retained by the standpipe) and maintain a vacuum against the vacuum pump. 3) The tank must be strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure against the vacuum inside and must have sufficient volume to enable exposure of a sufficiently large amount of sprayed oil to the vacuum. 4) The spray nozzles must be sized to atomize the oil and to ensure that the rate of flow of sprayed oil does not exceed {{the rate at which the}} venturi action can empty the tank. 5) The vacuum pump must produce a hard vacuum against the venturi tube and continue to work when it ingests some oil and water. 6) Fittings must be made vacuum tight (by use of O-rings) to prevent leakage of air into the system. The system is fully automatic, and can be allowed to remain in operation with very little monitoring. It is capable of reducing the air content of the oil from 11 to less than 1 volume percent in about 4 hours and to keep the water content below 100 parts per million...|$|R
40|$|Annual {{operating}} costs for buildings are a substantial cost in a lifetime. It is therefore {{of interest to}} try and reduce these costs. A large fraction of this cost today as the buildings {{become more and more}} energy efficient is the cost of hot tap water. The study in this report looks into the potential for energy savings from grey wastewater. It is here looked at the amount of energy which can be recovered from hot water leaving the building and reused for pre heating of hot tap water and heating of building. The unit which would recover this energy {{is referred to as the}} grey-water heat recovery unit in this report. A residential building with three floors where each floor has one washing machine, one shower and one dishwasher has been as the case building for the report. The total living area of the building is 450 m 2. In the case building used in this report as much as 17. 1 % of the total used energy goes to heating of hot tap water. By installing a heat recovery system which can recover some of the energy stored in the used hot water which leaves the building, this this could be reduced to 10. 9 % of the total used energy according to simulations done in SIMIEN. There are also possibilities of using this energy for heating of the building as well as pre heating of hot tap water. There are a few different solutions for implementing a grey-water heat recovery unit which could give different energy recovery between 2 716 kWh/year to 3 759 kWh/year. The best solution would be to connect the grey-water heat recovery unit to pre-heating of hot tap water, heating of the building as well as installing an accumulation tank to store recovered energy in. The most simple solution which would give the lowest amount of recovered energy would be to just connect the grey-water heat recovery unit to pre heating of hot tap water. In this report two different simulation programs have been used, EnergyPlus and SIMIEN, to find what impact the energy reduction would have on the building and to see if the simulations would correspond to the theoretical estimates done in this report. The theoretical estimates based on equations for heat recovery and measured data for energy use in the case building gave a little bit better results than the simulated results for the same case building. Although there is a difference both gave a positive indication that a heat recovery unit would not only reduce the energy consumption but also reduce the annual operating cost of a building. The investment cost for a heat recovery system could be a bit large for small buildings compared to the annual savings but for larger buildings the investment cost could be substantially higher. Regarding the energy as much as 87. 7 % of the energy stored in the grey-water could be recovered for a system with an accumulation <b>tank</b> and a <b>connection</b> to the buildings heating system. For a system without the accumulation tank and district heating as the energy source it would have a theoretical efficiency of 76. 7 % and a simulated efficiency of 63. 3 % when simulated in EnergyPlus. </p...|$|R
