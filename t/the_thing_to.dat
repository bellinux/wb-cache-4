5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E

500|$|The Romans {{distinguished}} between [...] "manifest" [...] and [...] "non-manifest theft" [...] {{based on how}} close {{to the scene of}} the crime the thief was caught, although exactly where the line was debated by jurists. Under the Twelve Tables, death or flogging could be expected for a manifest thief, later changed to damages of four times the thing. The penalty for non-manifest theft was two times. There were complementary actions against the occupier of the property where the stolen goods were found, if the defendant did not bring <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> court or refused a search. Vindicatio or condictio could also be undertaken by the owner of the thing, in addition to an action under furtum.|$|E
500|$|By the {{classical}} period, physical punishment {{had been abandoned}} for manifest theft and Gaius records merely four-times damages, introduced by the praetor. This meant, somewhat strangely, that a praetorian action could be more serious than a civil action, which was unusual. [...] Gaius also elaborates slightly on what constitutes manifest theft. He says that most jurists believed it extended to being caught {{in the place of}} the theft with the thing, and no further. [...] Julian (jurist), Ulpian, and Justinian all described it as including the thief who was still carrying <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> its intended hiding place. There may have been a maximum time limit on manifest theft of this type, but it is unclear how long it was. The general rules for furtum were almost fully developed by {{the classical}} period and few significant changes were made during and after it.|$|E
500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Heidi Stringell finds Flagg [...] "an embodiment of pure evil", contending that King sees {{good and evil}} as “real forces”; Flagg’s embodiment of evil is confirmed {{by the fact that}} [...] "he is a killer, a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter". To Stringell, Flagg’s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “evil ultimately leads nowhere”. The author calls Flagg a [...] "generic hybrid" [...] of the archetypical [...] "Dark Man and the Trickster". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that [...] "Flagg's horror is that he looks like an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity—a terrible insight into the human psyche.

Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'"

50|$|These {{views in}} moral {{psychology}} have various implications. In particular, if motivational internalism is true, then an amoralist is unintelligible (and metaphysically impossible). An amoralist {{is not simply}} someone who is immoral, rather it is someone who knows what <b>the</b> moral <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do are, yet is not motivated to do them. Such an agent is unintelligible to the motivational internalist, because moral judgments about <b>the</b> right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do have built into them corresponding motivations <b>to</b> do those <b>things</b> that are judged by the agent <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> moral <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do. On <b>the</b> other hand, an amoralist is entirely intelligible to the motivational externalist, because the motivational externalist thinks that moral judgments about <b>the</b> right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do not necessitate some motivation <b>to</b> do those <b>things</b> that are judged <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do; rather, an independent desire—such as the desire {{to do the right}} thing—is required (Brink, 2003),(Rosati, 2006).|$|R
