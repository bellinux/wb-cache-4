40|$|We tried an {{investigation}} into the actual consumers conditions on the use of detergents as the basic data to diminish the usage of kitchen detergents and the amount of remained surfactants to <b>tablewares.</b> 1) About 3 / 4 of the examinees use undiluted kitchen detergents to wash <b>tablewares.</b> 2) The ways to rinse the <b>tablewares</b> differ among the ages of the examinees, and the way of persons in twenties was the worst in remaining surfactants on the <b>tablewares.</b> The best was that by persons in thirties. 3) The remained surfactant by the one-person household is larger than that by the relatives household. 4) The remained surfactant after washing of <b>tablewares</b> by persons with chidren is less than that by persons without children, and especially, that by the persons with infants is the least. 5) In the ways of rinsing, the way using sponge is rather effective to remove the surfactant attached to the plastic dishes. It is also significant to remove attached surfactant on dishes by dipping the washed dishes in water during rinsing other dishes. 6) People who wash dishes roughly tend to remain rather high amount of surfactant on dishes than those who wash dishes carefully. It is remarkable that the gross amount of surfactants by 13 % of examinees was over 0. 2 ppm which is the maximum permissible amount of anion surfactants of city water...|$|R

Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Arretine ware, {{in spite}} of its very {{distinctive}} appearance, {{was an integral part of}} the wider picture of fine ceramic <b>tablewares</b> in the Graeco-Roman world of the Hellenistic and early Roman period. [...] That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury <b>tablewares</b> made of silver. [...] Centuries before Italian [...] terra sigillata was made, Attic painted vases, and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing. [...] Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.|$|R
50|$|His {{visits to}} {{exhibitions}} {{such as the}} 1925 Paris Exposition, and the in London inspired Murray to seek out opportunities to design vases and <b>tablewares</b> for factory production, and as the depression of the early 1930s further reduced the demand for architecture he became a full-time designer.|$|R

5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value <b>tableware</b> and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions. Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter <b>tableware,</b> and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Haynes Stellite {{moved to}} {{producing}} <b>tableware,</b> jewelry, and pocket knives. The {{employees of the}} company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to sell the company to Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much $4million on the sale. After a series of owners, the company is now called Haynes International and is again independent.|$|E

5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made <b>tableware</b> and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{seemingly}} {{loved his}} young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On {{the occasion of}} their first New Year in 1386, {{he gave her a}} red velvet palfrey saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for Karol and Elisabeth), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, <b>tableware</b> and clothing. The uncles too, apparently, were pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went on a military campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to Creil to live with his step great-grandmother Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, where {{in the early years of}} their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large <b>tableware</b> items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and <b>tableware.</b> This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, <b>tableware</b> or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table <b>tableware</b> range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E
5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver <b>tableware.</b> British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

40|$|Many theorists see {{the eighteenth}} century as a time ofprofound change in European America. This paper tests some of these {{theories}} with data from 21 eighteenth-century archaeological sites in Delaware that have been extensively excavated. The sites date to {{all parts of the}} 1680 - 1830 period, and their occupants span the social range from poor tenants to well-to-do planters. Eighteen of the excavations were sponsored by the Delaware Department of Transportation, and the techniques employed in the excavation and analysis of these sites were quite similar. Comparing the house remains, farm layouts, ceramics, glass, <b>tablewares,</b> clothing-related artifacts, and faunal remains from these sites reveals a complex pattern of developments. Certain parts of the material culture of rural Delaware did experience profound and relatively rapid change, especially ceramics and <b>tablewares.</b> However, other aspects of life, including housing and meat consumption, changed very little, if at all. The archaeological record does not support the view that the eighteenth-century saw changes in outlook and thinking that influenced every part of American life.
