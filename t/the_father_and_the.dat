5|$|The Devil's Brood (2008) {{opens with}} the {{conflict}} between Henry II, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their four sons, which escalates into a decade of warfare and rebellion pitting the sons against <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brothers against each other while Eleanor spends the period imprisoned by Henry. Penman places the characters against a tightly woven tapestry of medieval life, personal conflict, and dramatic characters.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. <b>The</b> <b>father's</b> semen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mother's menses have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics.

5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the name of <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|The way Caracalla {{wanted to}} be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many {{surviving}} busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown with laureate after becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 209. Between 209 and their father's death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready {{to take over the}} empire. Between the death of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta's effort to be seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla's presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues. During Caracalla's sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla's sole rule.|$|E

25|$|Within {{mainstream}} (Trinitarian) Christianity the Holy Spirit {{is one of}} {{the three}} persons of the Trinity who make up the single substance of God. As such the Holy Spirit is personal, and as part of the Godhead, he is fully God, co-equal and co-eternal with God the Father and Son of God. He is different from <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Son in that he proceeds from the Father (or from <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Son) as described in the Nicene Creed. His sacredness is reflected in the New Testament gospels which proclaim blasphemy against the Holy Spirit as unforgivable.|$|E

25|$|It was in {{this context}} of {{conflict}} between East and West that the Monothelite Patriarch Paul of Constantinople made accusations against Pope Theodore of Rome for speaking of the Holy Spirit as proceeding from <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Son. Pope Theodore's expression was in a letter that he wrote, not in the Creed, which was not yet used liturgically in Rome.|$|E
25|$|In the {{judgment}} of these Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church is in fact teaching {{as a matter of}} Roman Catholic dogma that the Holy Spirit derives his origin and being (equally) from both <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Son, making the Filioque a double procession. This is the very thing that Maximus the Confessor was stating in his work from the 7th century that would be wrong and that the West was not doing.|$|E
25|$|While the Filioque {{doctrine}} was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose Tome {{was approved}} at the Council of Chalcedon, its {{inclusion in the}} Creed appeared in the anti-Arian situation of 7th-century Spain. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East. The Filioque, included in the Creed by certain anti-Arian councils in Spain, was a means to affirm the full divinity of the Son in relation to both <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spirit.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox Christians {{believe in}} the Holy Trinity, three distinct, divine persons (hypostases), without overlap or {{modality}} among them, who share one divine essence (ousia Greek οὐσία)—uncreated, immaterial and eternal. These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The Father is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the Son is eternal and begotten of <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Holy Trinity is summarized in the Symbol of Faith.|$|E
