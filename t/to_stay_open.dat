In 2013, Trump Taj Mahal opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers.

Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property, it is illegal for a person underage 21 to drink in a casino hotel room unless a family member is present.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the grand}} opening, the theatre {{served as a}} venue for {{vaudeville}} and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>open.</b> It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E
5|$|Goldfingers $3 {{million budget}} was recouped in two weeks, and it broke box office records in {{multiple}} {{countries around the}} world. The Guinness Book of World Records went on to list Goldfinger as the fastest grossing film of all time. Demand for the film was so high that the DeMille cinema in New York City had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>open</b> twenty-four hours a day. The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States and $46 million worldwide. After reissues, the first being as a double feature with Dr. No in 1966, Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States and $73,800,000 elsewhere, for a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000.|$|E
5000|$|Because of George Webb's {{commitment}} <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>open</b> 24 hours a day, {{combined with}} the restaurants' reasonably low prices on food and drink, the chain has become a notorious refuge for homeless adults and juveniles.

Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered. In 2001, Flight International reported that Taiwan might meet its requirement for a short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the F-16 Fighting Falcon's APG-66 radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed the production line <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>open</b> beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.|$|E

The Hotel Association of Metropolitan Washington agreed to pay for extended train service provided by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on January 19 to accommodate visitors attending inaugural events and workers providing support for those events.|$|E
5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>open</b> the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E

Kudra MacCalleich of the Concord Feminist Health Center framed the need for feminist health centers in terms of biodiversity: “Why is biodiversity so crucial? Because we know there are significant negative consequences when a species is lost, and that once we lose it, there is high improbability that we will ever get it back. I think there is a critical role to be played by the diverse and distinct types of providers we still have in our 'health care ecosystem' and that we should consider what might be the consequences of their disappearance and absorption into the corporate conglomerate.” ...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical codes (TC’s) are the {{abstract}} models that emerge during the sorting of mature memos in {{to a potential}} substantive theory. They conceptualize the integration of substantive codes into hypotheses of a substantive theory. The researcher is challenged <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> their emergence and earned relevance rather than their preconceived forcing, which is very strong. They not only bring in their framework, but also their theoretical perspective, which can easily force the data beyond emergence. For example, using a basic social process TC requires at least two stages and {{there may not be}} a process in the sorting emergence. It may be all just be dimensions or conditional. In this chapter I discuss the skill of <b>staying</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the emergent TC. As the reader knows, there are many TC’s and each has its requirement for use and perspective. In chapter 3 of the book Getting out of the Data: I will discuss more fully all the TC effects that originate preconceptions...|$|R

Improvements to the plazas, to cost $150million, will include a food court layout and improved restrooms. Sunoco continues operating gas stations at the renovated service plazas. Most of the plazas were completely rebuilt, although the exterior structure of South Midway's building was retained when it reopened in May 2013 due to its historical significance of being the flagship service plaza on the original section. Four service plazas were slated to be closed {{as part of the}} deal with HMSHost. Three plazas (Hempfield, South Neshaminy, and North Neshaminy) closed due to construction projects to the turnpike itself, while the Zelienople service plaza (which was originally slated <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>open)</b> closed due to its under-use.|$|E

Three technological revolutions have made major contributions: the steam engine and telegraph last century, {{the internal combustion engine}} and telephone during this century, and most recently the digital revolution's impact on communication and information costs. Equally important have been the deregulatory policy reforms made by national governments. Those have been partly unilateral or regional, but the GATT/WTO has been crucial during the past half century in encouraging economies to open up more and <b>to</b> commit <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> international trade.

With the worldwide success of the shutters of Wollensak like the Junior since 1903, most of the other shutter manufacturers in the world overtook the (now international) settings T for time, I for instantaneous.
