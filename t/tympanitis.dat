50|$|The {{effects of}} the {{pharmaceutical}} drug Tanakan were observed when treating tympanophonia in elderly women. Tanakan was found to decrease the intensity of <b>tympanitis</b> and improve speech and hearing in aged patients, giving rise {{to the idea of}} recommending treatment with it to elderly patients with presbycusis or normal tonal hearing.|$|E

Furthermore, we provide evidence that the essential growth factor for TD-SCVs, i. e., thymidine, and its metabolite dTMP are present in various human specimens. During chronic Staphylococcus aureus infections, variants of this pathogen can emerge {{that are able to}} persist in patients for months or years in a dormant metabolic state (14). These bacteria are designated “small-colony variants ” (SCVs) due to their phenotypic traits. In contrast to “normal-colony variants” (NCVs), SCVs grow on sheep blood agar as tiny, nonpig-mented, and nonhemolytic colonies and show decreased met-abolic activity (10, 11, 12, 19). SCVs are easily overgrown by more rapidly dividing strains (14) and can be cultured only in the presence of distinct growth factors.

40|$|Temperature-sensitive mutants (TSMs) of Mycoplasma pulmonis were {{produced}} by treating the wild-type strain with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Three TSMs were selected at 38 degrees C, as a restrictive temperature, and at 34 degrees C, as a permissive temperature. Two TSMs, UTCMI and UTCMII, were {{proven to be}} nonpathogenic but immunogenic. In addition, they did not induce pneumonia, tracheitis, or <b>tympanitis</b> but did induce mild rhinitis. They were stable after 10 passages in vitro and in vivo. They elicited excellent antibody production and cell-mediated immunity in vaccinated rats. They also were not mitogenic to rat lymphocytes. Rats immunized intranasally with these TSMs were significantly protected against challenge with wild-type organisms. These mutants were morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from the wild-type organisms. The growth characteristics and antibiotic sensitivities {{were similar to those}} of wild-type organisms, except that they grew only at 34 degrees C. In contrast to wild-type organisms, they did not bind to or lyse sheep erythrocytes. Thus, these TSMs may qualify as a vaccine to prevent M. pulmonis infection in rats...|$|E
40|$|In Ayurvedic {{system of}} {{medicine}} T. purpurea {{is used as}} important drug for various ailments as tonic, laxative, anthelmintic, purifier of blood, a cordial, cough, asthma, <b>tympanitis,</b> dyspepsia, snake bite and in bilious febrile attacks enlargement and obstruction of the liver, spleen and kidneys. The roots are the sites of synthesis and/or storage of many plant metabolites and also an important organ {{for the production of}} valuable phytochemical. Roots of T. purpurea contain tephrosin, deguelin, isotephrosin and maxima substances which makes it important drug plant. Therefore, an attempt had been made to study the inoculation effect of Agrobacterium rhizogenes (MTCC- 532) on growth, development of hairy roots and its effect on production of secondary metabolites in T. purpurea roots. After transformation of A. rhizogene (MTCC- 532) significant increment in fresh weight in hairy roots cultured in solidified media was observed, the data revealed 7. 6 times more fresh weight from initial fresh weights. In inoculated roots fast initiation of hairy roots was observed. 1. 528 g tephrosin was obtained from 40 g of roots of field grown plants, giving the concentration of tephrosin in field grown plants roots to 38. 2 mg /g d. w. b...|$|E
40|$|Pasteurella multocida (serotype 3 :A) was {{isolated}} from a rabbit with clinical signs of suppurative rhinitis. This P. multocida strain was mutagenized with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine {{to obtain a}} genetically stable streptomycin-dependent mutant, from which a life vaccine was prepared. Pasteurella-free rabbits were inoculated intranasally three times at weekly intervals and challenged intranasally with a virulent serotype 3 :A rabbit P. multocida isolate 2 weeks after the third vaccination. The rabbits were killed 2 to 3 weeks later. The vaccine did not cause clinical disease, death, or gross or microscopic lesions. Furthermore, the vaccine protected the challenge rabbits from developing clinical disease, death, and gross lesions. However, mild focal lung lesions were noted {{in several of the}} vaccinated-challenged animals. In contrast, nonvaccinated-challenged rabbits developed pyrexia and anorexia. Furthermore, three of four of these rabbits died with severe gross lesions including pyothorax, suppurative pericarditis, and fibrinopurulent pneumonia. Microscopically, the four nonvaccinated rabbits had moderate to severe suppurative pneumonia and mild to moderate suppurative rhinitis, and two had mild <b>tympanitis.</b> The mutant vaccine did not appear to colonize the nasal cavities.

40|$|The {{family of}} Syrphid flies (“Hover flies” or “Flower flies”) is richly {{represented}} in the Neotropical region. FLUKE’S Catalogue of Neotropical Syrphidae, finished in September 1953, records 107 genera and 1, 507 species, exclusive of 100 “species incertae sedis. ” (In actual fact, 1, 508 species are enumerated, but Baccha picta Wiedemann (FLUKE, p. 259) is an Ethiopian species.) The large genera Volucella with 274 species, Baccha with 269 species, Mesograpta with 130 species, and Eristalis with 106 species, {{seem to have had}} their greatest opportunity of development in this region. However, some of the names will probably prove to be synonyms, since the descriptions by earlier authors are often too short and insufficient to enable a species to be recognized with certainty. As a rule, the species described by recent authors are quite recognizable. Up to a few years ago the number of Syrphids described or known from Suriname was very small. Moreover, one of them, Volucella ardua Wiedemann, proved to be synonymous with Volucella <b>tympanitis</b> Fabricius, as stated by CURRAN, who studied WIEDEMANN’S type specimens. Of course, the number of the species taken on occasion in Suriname is somewhat larger; but, as far as is known, no enumeration has ever been published...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Locally {{advanced}} {{breast cancer}} (LABC) deteriorates {{the quality of}} life (QOL) of the affected patients. Combination chemotherapy or extended chemotherapy is considered to help to shrink local lesions. Case 1 : A 71 -year-old female with a history of <b>tympanitis</b> and cystitis with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) visited our hospital. There was a tumor of 7 cm in diameter in her right breast with skin ulceration. Paclitaxel + bevacizumab therapy was started, and after five cycles of therapy, a mastectomy with axillary dissection was performed. Chemotherapy with anthracycline was avoided for fear of activating the MRSA. After the operation, the patient's wound opened. However, it naturally epithelialized. Case 2 : A 41 -year-old female visited our hospital due to a tumor of 8 cm in diameter in her right breast with skin ulceration. Four cycles of paclitaxel + bevacizumab therapy were started, and her tumor almost disappeared during the first cycle. Then, doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide therapy was performed for four cycles, and a mastectomy with axillary dissection was performed. Her postoperative course was good. Discussion: Chemotherapy with bevacizumab or extended chemotherapy is generally not considered to contribute to a survival improvement. However, such therapy contributes in increasing the response to chemotherapy, and should be considered for patients with LABC to shrink the local lesions and improve the QOL...|$|E
40|$|Background: Compared with {{surgical}} resection, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for cholesterol granuloma (CG) in the petrous apex (PA) {{is associated}} with local recurrence due to obstruction of the drainage route. We present a detailed procedure of an endoscopic TSS using pedicle vascularized nasoseptal flap (PVNF). Methods: A 40 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} repeated surgery for left <b>tympanitis</b> was referred to our institution. Neurological examination revealed severe hearing loss in the left ear. Radiologic examination presented a round mass in the left PA and significant fluid collection in the mastoid air cells of the left temporal bone. CG was strongly suspected, and endoscopic TSS using PVNF was performed. Prior to endoscopic drainage, a PVNF was harvested from the mucosa of the ipsilateral nasal septum, with an attempt to preserve the sphenopalatine artery in the flap. Following this, puncture and adequate irrigation of the lesion was performed by endoscopic TSS, with neuro-navigation system assistance; the apex of PVNF was then placed into the lesion to prevent the obstruction of the drainage route. An absorbable polyglycolic acid sheet and fibrin glue were applied on the flap to prevent spontaneous deviation from the lesion. Results: The patient was discharged without any further neurological complications. Eight month postoperative computed tomography images showed no recurrence; the drainage route was patent and the fluid collection in the left mastoid air cells was resolved. Moreover, hearing loss was improved. Conclusions: Endoscopic TSS using PVNF may be one of available surgical options for PACG...|$|E

This tree is native to Sri Lanka and India; in India the distribution is restricted to the forests of Western Ghats regions. S. caryophyllatum fruits are edible, sweet and astringent in taste. The seeds and bark were dried and its decoction {{was used in the}} ailment of diabetes mellitus [17]. The leaf and bark extracts of this plant are well known for its antibacterial and antioxidant efficacy [18]. Root extract using different solvent system exhibited promising amount of phenol, flavonoids, tannins and vitamin C [19]. The bark extract of this plant was used in veterinary medicine for the treatment of <b>tympanitis</b> in cattles [20]. Tribal people consider this plant as a boon of nature and its fruits and seeds were consumed by Paniya tribal community of Waynad district, Kerala, India [21]. As the plant is used for medicinal purposes, the investigation of chemical constituents in the plant parts and its biological activities may provide valuable information. There is a detailed bioprospecting studies by using different organic solvent system with different plant parts have not been studied previously on S. caryophyllatum. Therefore the present study was carried out (i) to analyse the leaves essential oil and its antibacterial and larvicidal activities (ii) to assess the total phenols, flavonoids and tannins content; (iii) to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial, larvicidal and antidiabetic activities of the methanol extracts of S.caryophyllatum bark, leaves, fruit pulp and seeds.|$|E

40|$|Hearing {{impairment}} {{may affect}} children’s communication skills, social development, and educational achievement. Little {{is known about}} the prevalence of hearing impairment among Chinese children. Data were taken from the 2006 second China National Survey on Disability (CNSD). Hearing impairment was defined as moderate (41 – 60 dB HL), severe (61 – 80 dB HL), profound (81 – 90 dB HL), or complete (> 91 dB HL). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). A weighted number of 567, 915 hearing impairment children were identified, yielding a prevalence of 17. 49 per 10, 000 people (95 % CI: 16. 90 – 18. 08), with prevention or treatment options possible for 64. 6 % of hearing impairment children. The main causes of hearing impairment were hereditary, <b>tympanitis,</b> and drug intoxication. Illiteracy in one or both parents (mother: OR = 1. 388, 95 % CI: 1. 125 – 1. 714, p < 0. 0001; father: OR = 1. 537, 95 % CI: 1. 152 – 2. 049, p < 0. 0001 relative to no school or primary school), annual family income lower than national average (OR = 1. 323, 95 % CI: 1. 044 – 1. 675, p = 0. 0203, relative to higher than national average), household size larger than three people (OR = 1. 432, 95 % CI: 1. 164 – 1. 762, p = 0. 0007, relative to smaller than three people) and single-mother family (OR = 2. 056, 95 % CI: 1. 390 – 3. 042, p = 0. 0176, relative to intact family) were the independence risk factors for hearing impairment among Chinese children. Lower annual family income, male children, larger household size, single-mother family, and lower levels of maternal and paternal education were independent risk factors for hearing impairment for Chinese children. Further studies on hearing impairment prevention and the relationship between parental social factors and the risk of hearing impairment are needed...|$|E
