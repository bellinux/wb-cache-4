Aden and Joey {{do not get}} on with each other, however when he finds out about Joey's rape he becomes protective of her. The incident leaves Aden [...] "tormented by his childhood abuse" [...] and he sets out to gain justice for Joey. Lassance said that Aden nearly gives up until he finds out she is a lesbian, and says [...] "he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> prove her case". However, when Robbo threatens Joey, [...] "It's the final straw and Aden snaps", attacking Robbo.|$|E
500|$|Knowing that Liz {{will not}} break off with Danny, Jack tells Danny {{he knows about}} the two. He lies to Danny by telling him he cares for Liz, hoping that Danny [...] will end it with Liz, which he does. After Sue returns from a night of partying, Tracy tells her that {{all he wanted to}} do was to be a father figure to her. Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz had been looking for her. At the end, Tracy wonders if he can go through his experience with Sue if he has a daughter, to which Kenneth says he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Senators' bid was {{considered}} {{something of a}} longshot. Jim Durrell, the mayor of Ottawa at the time, but later part of the Senators' front office, said, [...] "It's not that the area isn't a big enough market to support a professional hockey team, it's just that we're {{not going to get}} it." [...] National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) head Alan Eagleson was quoted as saying, [...] "Local fans are being led through the petunia patch if Bruce Firestone <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> land an NHL expansion franchise for Ottawa this century, well into the next or ever."

500|$|Following a mid-year {{tour of the}} United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused {{permits for}} the group to appear in concerts there {{for the next four}} years, {{effectively}} cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music {{at the height of the}} British Invasion. [...] Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, [...] "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> come over here and make a career for himself." [...] following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.|$|E
500|$|The {{book also}} found early success with book buyers {{and the general}} public. It sold 6,000 copies {{in its first year}} and 1,600 in its second. Frances Chrystie, the {{juvenile}} buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel's publisher, [...] "I've been sitting alone in my apartment reading Horton aloud to myself over and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... merchandise manager <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week." [...] Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.|$|E

500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> bluff {{his way out of}} it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E
500|$|Early in Bure's career, he {{was noted}} for playing a strong two-way game. Having joined Pat Quinn's defensive-minded Canucks in 1991, Bure's {{transition}} to the NHL was cited as being easier than that of his countryman, Igor Larionov, due to his quick adjustment to the team's defensive demands. Regarding Bure's first NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets, reporter Mike Beamish explained that [...] "hockey fans marvelled at his offensive thrusts, but hockey people were taken by a singular display of jet-powered defensive diligence. On one play, after the Canucks were caught deep in the Winnipeg zone, the Russian winger raced back and almost single-handedly foiled a two-on-one Jets' rush, making up a half-rink disadvantage." [...] Bure was used on the team's penalty kill for his entire tenure with the Canucks, and was proficient at generating shorthanded chances, pressuring the opposition with his quickness and positioning in the defensive zone. During the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, commentator and ex-NHL coach Harry Neale commented, [...] "I like the effort he gives it when he doesn't have the puck. We all know {{what he can do}} when he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> score, but he's killing penalties, he's checking, doing a lot of things." [...] Bure tied for second-place on Bob McKenzie's 1993 coaches poll for the NHL's best penalty killer. He was also voted the league's second-best stickhandler that season and garnered recognition as one of the smartest players in the NHL.|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

2500|$|On 17 February, four minor {{opposition}} groupsADDI, the Alliance, the Socialist Renewal Party (PSR), and SURSAUTjoined the UFC in backing Fabre's candidacy. Together they reconstituted {{the opposition}} coalition as the Republican Front for the Alternance and Change (FRAC); Yamgnane remained its campaign spokesman, while Patrick Lawson was designated as campaign director. FRAC {{called on the}} CAR and OBUTS to join the coalition. Fabre {{said in an interview}} on 17 February that the coalition represented a majority of the opposition's electorate and that, in reference to the other parties, [...] "it is up to them to join us"; expressing some exasperation, he said that [...] "the ego is so strong in Togo that everyone <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be President". He nevertheless said discussions would continue with the other parties and also insisted, in reaction to suggestions that the UFC was divided, that Olympio supported his candidacy. Regarding the UFC's suspended participation in CENI, he said that the UFC representatives would return to the body because it would be preposterous to participate in the election while boycotting the electoral commission.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars are not agreed {{as to what}} Greene {{meant by}} his cryptic {{comments}} or what motivated them. Greene complains of an actor who <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> write as well as university-educated playwrights, he alludes to a line in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, and he uses the term [...] "Shake-scene," [...] a term never used prior to Groatsworth. Most scholars agree that Greene had Shakespeare in mind, who in 1592 {{would have been an}} [...] "upstart" [...] actor writing and contributing to plays such as the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III, all of which were likely written and produced (although not published) prior to Greene's death. Hanspeter Born has argued that Greene's attack on the [...] "upstart Crow" [...] was provoked because, in his view, Shakespeare may have rewritten parts of Greene's play A Knack to Know a Knave. Believing that Thomas Nashe is [...] "by far the stronger suspect" [...] for having written the passage regarding the [...] "upstart Crow", Katherine Duncan-Jones points to instances in which Nashe may have had reason to be provoked.|$|E
2500|$|Body {{contact between}} runner and fielder is {{frequent}} in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven {{to a large}} extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball, to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, or he might simply bowl the catcher over, if he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does not have the ball, the runner may still bowl the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for [...] "tagging" [...] rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate. Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally [...] "throw out" [...] a runner by hitting him (or [...] "soaking" [...] him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket's wickets). This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal [...] "bowling" [...] of the ball, underhand, as with the old rules of both cricket and baseball. [...] "All 'round hands down" [...] kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{repeatedly}} accused President Barack Obama {{of engaging}} in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Russia. Hanson argues that Vladimir Putin is the embodiment of [...] "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled [...] "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: [...] "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, {{there is something about}} constitutional government and liberal rule that bothers Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, {{the more likely they are}} to bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much". Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people out of a sense of hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American [...] "reset" [...] diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine. Should Putin wish to absorb Estonia or other Baltic States, NATO probably would not stop him." ...|$|E
