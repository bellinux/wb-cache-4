40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a new {{approach}} to the <b>three</b> or four <b>layer</b> channel routing problem. Since two layer channel routing has been well studied, there are several two layer routers which can produce optimal or near optimal solution for almost all the practical problems. We develop a general technique which transforms a two layer routing solution systematically into a <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> routing solution. The solution transformation approach is different from previous approaches for <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> and multi-layer channel routing. Our router performs well in comparison with other <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> channel routers proposed thus far. In particular, it provides a 10 -track optimal solution for the famous Deutsch's difficult example, whereas other well-known <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> channel routers required 11 or more tracks.

5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. <b>Three</b> <b>layers</b> of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E

5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath {{each of the}} <b>three</b> <b>layers</b> of the heart. These networks collect into a main {{left and}} a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains {{the section of the}} left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised <b>three</b> <b>layers).</b> The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} <b>three</b> <b>layers.</b> At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells.

At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E

5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a <b>three</b> <b>layers</b> since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis are at least <b>three</b> <b>layers</b> of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, {{but these are not}} associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by <b>three</b> <b>layers</b> of pigment cells called chromatophores.

The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E

The effect of the hydarulic trap in minimizing diffusive downward chloride movement was investigated in both models. The agreement between the experimental results and theoretical predictions suggests that existing solute transport theory can adequately predict chloride migration through two saturated layers of clay over sand and also <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> soil systems consisting of two saturated silt layers with an unsaturated sand drainage layer in between. The comparison of the downward and upward advective-diffusive transport in two and <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> soil models, having two different Darcy velocities and soil density, showed that the upward flow (hydraulic trap) could reduce the concentrations in the underlying receptor reservoirs in both models.

Computation of the TOA (corresponding to true flight distance) for <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> model requires the complex minimization algorithm. Proposed method transforms <b>three</b> <b>layer</b> (air-wall-air) model to equivalent two layer (air-wall) model with lower computation complexity. It uses iterative solution of well defined minimization problem. Moreover, conveniently selected initial conditions of iteration process can further decrease computational complexity of the method.

Therefore, it is suitable for implementation on realtime hardware.
