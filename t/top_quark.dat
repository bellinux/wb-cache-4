5|$|The quark {{model was}} {{independently}} proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced {{as parts of}} an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. The <b>top</b> <b>quark</b> {{was the last to}} be discovered at Fermilab in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes asymptotic freedom: as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as color confinement: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of hadronization occurs before quarks, formed in a high energy collision, are able to interact in any other way. The only exception is the <b>top</b> <b>quark,</b> which may decay before it hadronizes.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new and highly efficient tagger for hadronically decaying <b>top</b> <b>quarks,</b> based on a deep neural network working with Lorentz vectors and the Minkowski metric. With its novel machine learning setup and architecture {{it allows us to}} identify boosted <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> not only from calorimeter towers, but also including tracking information. We show how the performance of our tagger compares with QCD-inspired and image-recognition approaches and find that it significantly increases the performance for strongly boosted <b>top</b> <b>quarks.</b> Comment: to be submitted to SciPos...|$|R

The cross section of pair-produced <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> is measured in several channels, including the single lepton, dilepton and all hadronic channel, some using information from b-tagging...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{studies of}} the performance of several jet-substructure techniques, which are used to identify hadronically decaying <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> with high transverse momentum contained in large-radius jets. The efficiency of identifying <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> is measured using a sample of top-quark pairs and the rate of wrongly identifying jets from other quarks or gluons as <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> is measured using multijet events collected with the ATLAS experiment in 20. 3 fb − 1 of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Predictions from Monte Carlo simulations are found to provide an accurate description of the performance. The techniques are compared in terms of signal efficiency and background rejection using simulations, covering a larger range in jet transverse momenta than accessible in the dataset. Additionally, a novel technique is developed that is optimized to reconstruct <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> in events with many jets...|$|R
25|$|The quasi-infrared {{fixed point}} has {{subsequently}} {{formed the basis}} of <b>top</b> <b>quark</b> condensation theories of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson is composite at extremely short distance scales, composed of a pair of top and antitop quarks.|$|E
25|$|In {{other models}} the Higgs scalar is a {{composite}} particle. For example, in technicolor {{the role of the}} Higgs field is played by strongly bound pairs of fermions called techniquarks. Other models, feature pairs of top quarks (see <b>top</b> <b>quark</b> condensate). In yet other models, there is no Higgs field at all and the electroweak symmetry is broken using extra dimensions.|$|E
25|$|In the Standard Model, {{all of the}} quark and lepton Yukawa {{couplings}} {{are small}} compared to the <b>top</b> <b>quark</b> Yukawa coupling. Understanding this hierarchy in the fermion masses is an open problem in theoretical physics. Yukawa couplings are not constants and their values change depending on the energy scale (distance scale) at which they are measured. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings {{are determined by the}} renormalization group equation.|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} physics {{involved}} in the production and decay of <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> in e + e − → t¯t near threshold, with special emphasis on the recent theoretical study on the decay process of <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> in the threshold region. The energy-angular distribution of l + in semileptonic top decays is calculated including the full O(αs) corrections. Various effects of the finalstate interactions are elucidated. A new observable is defined near threshold, which depends only on the decay of free polarized <b>top</b> <b>quarks,</b> and thus it can be calculated without bound-state effects or the final-state interactions...|$|R
40|$|Studies of highly-boosted <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> {{produced}} inclusively in pp collisions at 14 TeV are discussed. The hadronic decays of boosted <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> was {{studied in}} a data-driven approach by analysing shapes of jet-mass distributions. Using Monte Carlo models after a fast detector simulation, it is shown that inclusive production of boosted <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> {{can be observed}} {{if it has a}} cross section at least twice larger than the prediction from the approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (aNNLO) calculation for the ttbar process. The ttbar process with the nominal aNNLO strength can be measured using the masses of jets after a b-tagging. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{associated}} {{production of}} the Higgs boson with <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> should allow the direct observation of the coupling of the Higgs boson to <b>top</b> <b>quarks.</b> The channel also benefits for a large cross-section increase between 8 and 13 TeV. ATLAS results {{in the search for}} the Higgs boson in the ttH production mode will be presented...|$|R
25|$|The {{conformal}} symmetry {{is associated}} with the vanishing of the beta function. This can occur naturally if a coupling constant is attracted, by running, toward a fixed point at which β(g) = 0. In QCD, the fixed point occurs at short distances where g → 0 and is called a (trivial) ultraviolet fixed point. For heavy quarks, such as the <b>top</b> <b>quark,</b> it is calculated that the coupling to the mass-giving Higgs boson runs toward a fixed non-zero (non-trivial) infrared fixed point.|$|E
25|$|For {{two generations}} of quarks, there are no CP violating phases, {{as shown by the}} {{counting}} of the previous section. Since CP violations were seen in neutral kaon decays already in 1964, the emergence of the Standard Model soon after was a clear signal of the existence of a third generation of quarks, as pointed out in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa. The discovery of the bottom quark at Fermilab (by Leon Lederman's group) in 1976 therefore immediately started off the search for the missing third-generation quark, the <b>top</b> <b>quark.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{also allows}} more exotic decays, {{but only at}} one loop level, meaning that they are {{extremely}} suppressed. In particular, {{it is possible for}} a <b>top</b> <b>quark</b> to decay into another up-type quark (an up or a charm) by emitting a photon or a Z-boson. Searches for these exotic decay modes have provided no evidence for their existence in accordance with expectations from the Standard Model. The branching ratios for these decays have been determined to be less than 5.9 in 1,000 for photonic decay and less than 2.1 in 1,000 for Z-boson decay at 95% confidence.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>top</b> <b>quarks</b> {{are very}} massive, {{large amounts of}} energy are needed to create one. The only way to achieve such high {{energies}} is through high energy collisions.
