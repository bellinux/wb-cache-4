500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive, noting its ability to [...] "capture some of the appeal from the pre-cancellation days." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode's story, writing that it had [...] "a great storyline and the right {{combination}} of irrelevant and relevant jokes", giving the episode an 8.4 out of 10. In another positive review, Brett Love of TV Squad called the episode [...] "solid," [...] and praised the scenes set in 1984, and the alternate world. Love went on to state, [...] "The show has lost a little of the luster that it once had, but that's no reason to count <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were enough bright spots to give hope for a return to that old form when season six comes around in the fall."

Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone can go back and listen to what I was doing when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, {{those are the kind of}} records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> like I am now." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{received}} the first hurt I got {{in this war}} at this action, for having followed the dragoons and brought my regiment within the barricado which they had gained, a musket bullet struck my horse just in the head, and that so effectually that he fell down as dead as a stone all at once. The fall plunged me into a puddle of water and daubed me; and my man having brought me another horse and cleaned me a little, I was just getting up, when another bullet struck me on my left hand, which I had just clapped on the horse's main to lift myself into the saddle. The blow broke one of my fingers, and bruised my hand very much; and it proved a very painful hurt to me. For the present I did not much concern myself about it, but made my man tie it up close in my handkerchief, and led up my men to the market-place, where {{we had a very}} smart brush with some musketeers who were posted in the churchyard; but our dragoons soon beat <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and the whole town was then our own. We made no stay here, but marched back with all our booty to Oxford, for we knew the enemy were very strong at Gloucester, and that way.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} dark, when several men, bearing large bundles of straw and bamboos, {{ran across the}} open ground and entered the mosque, and the besieged guessed that another attempt was {{to be made to}} smoke <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> had been much {{consultation}} {{on the part of the}} enraged mutineers, and this time two men, with their muskets leveled at their shoulders, led the advance. Very slowly they made their way up, until a pistol shot rang out, and one of the leaders, discharging his musket before him, fell. Then there was a halt. Another Sepoy, with fixed bayonet, took the place in front, and over the shoulders of him and his comrade those behind threw bundles of straw mixed with wet leaves; a light was applied to this, and with a sheet of flame between themselves and the besieged, they had no fear. Now they pressed forward, threw on fresh straw, and then, knowing that the besieged would have fled higher, reached through the flames with a pole with a hook attached to it, and hauled down the barricade. The moment the fire burned a little low, two men lighted fresh bundles, and, stamping out the fire, advanced up the stairs, carrying before them the blazing bundles like torches, the volumes of smoke from these of course preceding them.|$|E
60|$|To {{the south}} of Johannesburg, half-way between that town and the frontier, there is a range of hills called the Zuikerboschrand, which extends across from one railway system to the other. A number of Boers were known to have sought refuge in this country, so upon February 12th a small British force left Klip River Post in order to clear <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were 320 men in all, {{composing}} the 28th Mounted Infantry, drawn from the Lancashire Fusiliers, Warwicks, and Derbys, most of whom had just arrived from Malta, which one would certainly imagine {{to be the last}} place where mounted infantry could be effectively trained. Major Dowell was in command. An advance was made into the hilly country, but {{it was found that the}} enemy was in much greater force than had been imagined. The familiar Boer tactics were used with the customary success. The British line was held by a sharp fire in front, while strong flanking parties galloped round each of the wings. It was with great difficulty that any of the British extricated themselves from their perilous position, and the safety of a portion of the force was only secured by the devotion of a handful of officers and men, who gave their lives in order to gain time for their comrades to get away. Twelve killed and fifty wounded were our losses in this unfortunate skirmish, and about one hundred prisoners supplied the victors with a useful addition to their rifles and ammunition. A stronger British force came up next day, and the enemy were driven out of the hills.|$|E
