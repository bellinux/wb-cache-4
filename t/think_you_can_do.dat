500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, I said that because I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E
2500|$|He {{described}} his early philosophy as [...] "If you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{it and you}} want to do it—then do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He took {{advantage}} of this odd but opportune melting. He placed {{his arm around her}} shoulders. She tried to escape it, but with a coy, shy movement, half hysterical, half girlish, unlike her usual stony, moral precision. [...] "Yes, Joan," [...] he repeated, laughingly, [...] "but whose fault is it? Not HIS, remember! And I firmly believe he <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> him good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a snap {{what she}} <b>thinks.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> just as <b>you</b> like about telling her. Perhaps {{it will be}} as well, as I intend to see {{a good deal of}} you in the next few days. But if you write home don't say {{anything}} about it. There are reasons which we can talk over another time, why it will be best to keep it to ourselves for a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{how nice}} and fresh it all looks!' said she as he {{set down the}} clear large figures. 'I cannot <b>think</b> how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it so evenly.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... breakfast. We've got {{the boat}} {{here and we}} want a man to take it into the mountains. If you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it the job is yours." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason behind}} Chavez's {{departure}} {{was that he}} had another conflict with the band. Chavez brought his wife with him on the band's 2010 tour. When the band didn't let her on the 2011 tour, he reportedly told the other members, [...] "Alright, if you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this without me, you go right ahead." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a true {{freshman}} in 1982, Harbaugh, at age 18, and junior Dave Hall were backups to quarterback Steve Smith, who had broken Michigan's single season record with 2,335 yards of total offense in 1981. In the 1982 season, Smith started all 12 games, and Hall handled the limited backup role. Even as Smith struggled, coach Schembechler expressed {{a reluctance to}} play Harbaugh, saying, [...] "To suddenly pull some freshman out of the bag, I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that in today's football." [...] Harbaugh did not see any game action in 1982, registered no statistics, and retained four years of eligibility under the NCAA's redshirt rule.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like enough," [...] {{said the}} poor wife. [...] "He'd prey upon anybody {{as he could}} get a-hold of. And so, Mr. Wharton, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{that for}} yourself, Mr. Davies," [...] Elizabeth said almost roughly. [...] "I mean {{it will be}} more appreciated," [...] and she turned upon her heel.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{trust to}} Providence, as Mrs. Lynde says," [...] smiled Gilbert. [...] "Certainly, no more committees. They only {{aggravate}} him. Julia Bell <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything, if <b>you</b> {{only have a}} committee to attempt it. Next spring, Anne, we must start an agitation for nice lawns and grounds. We'll sow good seed betimes this winter. I've a treatise here on lawns and lawnmaking and I'm going to prepare a paper on the subject soon. Well, I suppose our vacation is almost over. School opens Monday. Has Ruby Gillis got the Carmody school?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
6000|$|After having again {{consulted}} {{for some}} time, Bonchamps said to Cathelineau: [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better than name Adolphe Denot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{doubt you}} {{spend much of}} your time in reading, Mistress Ruth,' he remarked. 'It puzzles me to <b>think</b> what else <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so far from town?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, my dear, I <b>think</b> all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to pray {{not only}} for {{protection}} from lightning and tempest, but {{that you may be}} guarded from the fright that makes you forget to watch yourself, and so renders the danger greater! You could not well have been drowned where you fell; but {{if it had been a}} river--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything, for I {{perfectly}} ache to be useful; {{everyone is}} so good to me, especially Aunt Jessie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Become his friend, dear Digby. I always <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything. Yes! my only {{trust is}} in you. Oh! my Digby, make us all happy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{here you}} are, fortunately!" [...] Madame de Vionnet laughed. [...] "Mrs. Newsome," [...] she added in another tone, [...] "didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it?" [...] said Kate, [...] "I should {{suppose it}} would be a good deal harder to be Engineer than to be President." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] he said, [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>can</b> be <b>done</b> for two women, {{brought up}} as ladies, {{who choose to}} beggar themselves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say you don't want money, big money, money running into millions? Do you know what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it? Do you know the power it brings? And if you don't care about it for {{yourself}} <b>think</b> what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> opening new channels for human enterprise, giving occupation to thousands. My brain reels at the visions your words have conjured up." ...|$|R
3000|$|Kenny: Then {{are there}} other things or lessons that you find very {{interesting}} in other subjects which <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> the same thing? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! I {{suppose you}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as you please, {{with your own}} crowd around you," [...] he muttered. [...] "You don't {{know how to take}} a joke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may take}} the carrion, if you want to. But I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> no more than order it to be flung into a ditch and buried there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{man will}} never tell her—or speak {{a word to}} clear you. Still, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without friends of that kind. You have good ones in this country.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said {{something}} about loosening the tree that has drifted up alongside them," [...] came from Randy. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} catch up to the Blower party by to-night," [...] said Roger, earnestly. [...] "Mr. Dillon, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If only {{we could}} capture them ourselves!" [...] murmured Tom, his eyes glistening. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, with the sticks and pistols?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that. You {{will find}} it {{difficult}} to get beyond the front-door, and I would advise you to abandon all such ideas. What can you say to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{better than}} I did you’d better {{go down and}} see him," [...] {{retorted}} the mate hotly. [...] "After all, it’s you what ’e come to see. He’s your visitor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that, Porter, you've {{got another}} guess coming. You clear out {{and let me}} alone or I'll make it hot for you;" [...] and Ward Porton shook his fist in Dave's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, my dear Richard," [...] {{said the}} good surgeon, [...] "you must <b>think</b> what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for yourself, since your {{grandfather}} leaves you {{the choice of}} three honourable professions, by any of which, well and wisely prosecuted, you may become independent if not wealthy, and respectable if not great. You will naturally desire a little time for consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, about yourself. I really don't <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{better than}} what you proposed, {{when we were talking}} of it yesterday. You would be like a fish out of water, in England, if you had nothing to occupy your time; and {{therefore}} can't do better than enter the Service here, and remain, at any rate, for a few years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Between {{the first}} of August and the fifteenth," [...] he answered, [...] "you cannot <b>think.</b> All that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to say, Yes, No; Yes, No." [...] And he left me to imagine his responsibilities.|$|R
