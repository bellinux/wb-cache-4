5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of ITER {{emphasize}} {{that the only way}} to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas.

500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the question of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list.

500|$|Abramski's first {{defense was}} that the {{misrepresentation}} was not material since his uncle was legally capable of making the purchase himself, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> {{the question of whether}} he was purchasing the gun for himself was not required to be kept on the firearms dealer's record. When reaching the Supreme Court, Abramski modified his defense and claimed that the law only cares about the person buying the gun from the dealer, not the final receiver of the gun. The Court did not agree with this interpretation and held that the law cared about the final receiver, which is properly considered the person buying the gun. Such straw arrangement, the Court held, are different from allowed transfers where a person buys a gun for himself and later decides to sell it. The court therefore found that the misrepresentation was material and also that the answer was required to be kept on the dealer's record. The Court thus held that the purchase violated 18 U.S.C. §922(a)(6), which makes it unlawful to falsify facts [...] "material to the lawfulness of the sale,” and 18 U.S.C. §924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits misrepresentation with respect to information which a is required to maintain on record. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the declaration about the ultimate recipient of the gun was not material to the sale, and that it is not included in the information that the dealer is required to keep on the records. After the ruling, proponents of gun control stated that the Court's decision will help keep guns {{out of the hands of}} dangerous people, while opponents of gun control stated that the ruling is a [...] "horrible injustice".|$|E

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} beliefs, in West African Vodun, spells are not cast upon someone. Vodun is a {{religion}} in which an important part {{is devoted to the}} cult of the ancestors.

2500|$|Although Vivekananda did {{not write}} any commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, his works {{contained}} numerous references to the Gita, such as his lectures on the four yogas – Bhakti, Gyaana, Karma, and Raja. Through {{the message of the}} Gita, Vivekananda sought to energise the people of India to claim their own dormant but strong identity. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the problems that beset Hindu society was a revival of Hinduism in its purity, which lay in the reinterpretation of Bhagavad Gita for a new India. Aurobindo saw Bhagavad Gita as a [...] "scripture of the future religion" [...] and suggested that Hinduism had acquired a much wider relevance through the Gita. Sivananda called Bhagavad Gita [...] "the most precious jewel of Hindu literature" [...] and suggested its introduction into the curriculum of Indian schools and colleges. In the lectures Chinmayananda gave, on tours undertaken to revive of moral and spiritual values of the Hindus, he borrowed the concept of Gyaana yajna, or the worship to invoke divine wisdom, from the Gita. He viewed the Gita as a universal scripture to turn a person from a state of agitation and confusion to a state of complete vision, inner contentment, and dynamic action. Teachings of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organisation which spread rapidly in North America in the 1970s and 1980s, are based on a translation of the Gita called Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is by A.C.
