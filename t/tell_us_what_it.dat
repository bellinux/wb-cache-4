60|$|WELLWYN. [Looking stealthily round.] Ah! Well, come in--just for a minute--it's very cold--and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, professor," [...] said Phil Goodrich, in a quizzical, affectionate tone. [...] "Take {{the floor}} and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> isn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is quite}} different," [...] Selina answered, cuttingly. [...] "We should very much have enjoyed Mr. Brooks' lecture. Do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We want no French to {{read that}} signal, sir," [...] put in Greenly; [...] "the frigates {{themselves}} <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means. Monsieur de Vervillin has no idea of letting the Plantagenet take any thing he has, alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aren’t victims {{consulted}} {{about their}} particular ghost, the narrator asks. “Not a bit!” - imagine, he <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{would take to}} satisfy a single child: “There’d be no end to it!” (p. 35). Ghosts regard new houses as unsuitable for haunting until the ghost has [...] "trimmed" [...] the premises by loosening doors and drilling holes in floorboards “to let the wind come whistling through” (p. 38).|$|R
60|$|They <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> that <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{concerns}} protestants {{to do in}} that case, enough {{has been}} heard by us in parliament debates.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{have the}} Latin bit by bit, and then <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means," [...] said the shoemaker, {{who had been}} a {{frequent}} hearer of Fra Girolamo.|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR DICK: We {{have just}} heard {{something}} awful {{about you and}} Tom and Sam. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means. Of course we don't believe you have done anything wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish, John. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] said Octavia sharply, {{though her}} face whitened {{and her heart}} sank as the last word passed the man's lips.|$|E
5000|$|He then {{continued}} {{to describe the}} situation in Europe, punctuating his remarks with warnings of how the Nazis would use the same tactics in the Western Hemisphere, and giving vivid imagery such as [...] "The fate of these occupied nations <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to live {{at the point of}} a Nazi gun." [...] Roosevelt attacked the British prewar policy of [...] "appeasement," [...] calling it ineffective. Listing prior examples given by European countries, he said it was futile.|$|R
6000|$|VALIANT. Well, but brother, I pray thee <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> was <b>it</b> {{that was}} the cause of thy being upon thy knees even now? Was it for that some special mercies laid {{obligations}} upon thee, or how? ...|$|R
40|$|This week on War News Radio, {{we speak}} with the co-director of the {{documentary}} Body of War. The film follows a paralyzed Iraq war veteran who came home and found himself taking on a new role as an antiwar activist. Hansi Lo Wang reports. Then, we’ll check in with a women’s rights activist who is working to change opinions — and laws — in Iraq. Gabriel Ramirez reports. Finally, we hear from a chef in Baghdad who <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it’s</b> like working in an Iraqi restaurant. Ayub Nuri reports. These stories, plus the week’s news from War News Radio...|$|R
6000|$|... "You suspect something, Mr. Heysham," [...] said Aline, [...] "and {{you ought}} to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. I want {{to know exactly what}} you meant when you added 'Confidence men.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This box {{must have}} belonged {{to one of those}} French-Canadian smugglers," [...] said Dick. [...] "We'll have to get Uncle Randolph to read the writing and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo, [...] "we will; only, mother, if {{you would}} let us sit down here and read it--and then, {{if there is any}} thing which we cannot understand, you can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means." ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the facade}} facing the street of Poeta Querol, it find a second {{entrance}} much simpler than the main, {{is known as}} Entrance of the carriages, and already its name <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was for. The door dated between 1864 and 1867 has oak woodwork, while the panels that decorate it are of walnut. The decor is based on rockeries and fruits, highlighting the central panels two masks of the Greek god Pan (in Roman mythology: Faun). In addition it stand out among the rockery ornaments two sets of metal letters with the initials MD (Marqués de Dos Aguas).|$|R
6000|$|VALIANT. Well, but, brother, I pray thee, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> was <b>it</b> {{that was}} the cause of thy being upon thy knees even now: was it for that some special mercy laid upon thee, the need of prayer, or how? ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to preface my remarks by saying that I enjoyed reading this paper, which deals with a subject I knew too little about, but on which I now feel {{reasonably}} informed. The author has succeeded in writing down a model which to some degree captures the essence {{of three of the}} leading explanations of variation in research and development (R&# 38;D) activity across firms and industries. While the paper has some theoretical appeal, it falls short of its goal to distinguish these hypotheses empirically. As a result, the empirical aspects of the paper are the focus of my comments. I begin with an introductory review of the goals of the paper, the methods applied to achieve those goals, and its conclusions. This is followed by some remarks regarding the model's ability to capture the hypotheses posited in the literature on R&# 38;D. I then discuss the empirical content of the model: specifically the mapping from model parameters to predictions for observable variables. On this basis I proceed to a criticism of the author's empirical work: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> ought to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about R&# 38;D. </p...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] replied Jerry Muskrat. [...] "It is queer! It {{certainly}} is very queer! Let's go ask Grandfather Frog. You {{know he is}} very old and very wise, so perhaps he can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something has {{happened}} to please Sen," [...] cried the sister, her own mouth on a broad grin, in her expectation of coming in for {{a share of the}} gratification. [...] "I wish you would get him to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, Mary; he'll tell you anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some of the Little Flock {{cried out}} again. [...] "Oh, don't leave us, Father!" [...] "Take us all {{with you in}} the flesh!" [...] "We want to be taken up with you!" [...] and then some of them entreated, [...] "Tell us about it; <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will be like." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet he, too, had his economies, {{which we}} resent. I {{do not mean}} his not <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was that Roger Chillingworth saw on Arthur Dimmesdale's bare breast. To leave that vague is quite legitimate. But what had Miriam and the spectre of the Catacombs done? Who was the spectre? What did he want? To have told all {{this would have been}} better than to fill the novel with padding about Rome, sculpture, and the Ethics of Art. As the silly saying runs: [...] "the people has a right to know" [...] about Miriam and her ghostly acquaintance. {10} But the [...] "Marble Faun" [...] is not of Hawthorne's best period, {{beautiful}} as are a hundred passages in the tale.|$|R
6000|$|... 2. In that he doth <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> with <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was ceiled, and doth also thus repeat, saying, 'for the oracle, for it within, {{even for}} the most holy place,' it is because he would have it noted, that this only is the place that thus was done.|$|R
60|$|I {{have seen}} in that horrible country the road, sixty to a hundred yards broad, lie {{from side to side}} all poached with cattle, the land of no manner of benefit, and yet no going with a horse, but at every step up to the shoulders, full of sloughs and holes, and covered with {{standing}} water. It costs them incredible sums of money to repair them; and the very places that are mended would fright a young traveller to go over them. The Romans mastered this work, and by a firm causeway made a highway quite through this deep country, through Darkin in Surrey to Stansted, and thence to Okeley, and so on to Arundel; its name <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was made of (for it was called Stone Street), and many visible parts of it remain to this day.|$|R
60|$|BANNAL. I {{can see it}} {{all right}} enough; but how am I {{to know how to}} take it? Is it serious, or is it spoof? If the author knows what his play is, let him <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. If he doesnt, he cant {{complain}} if I dont know either. I'm not the author.|$|E
60|$|No, my friends, {{the very}} texts in the Bible which {{tell us that}} God cannot change or repent, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is that He cannot change in-- in showing loving-kindness and tender mercy, long-suffering, and repenting of the evil. Whatsoever else He cannot repent of, He cannot repent of repenting of the evil.|$|E
60|$|But {{says the}} Feather, {{why do you}} call me Fool too? why Sir, says he, because no Body could ever <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was you drove at, and we ha' been told you never knew your selves; now if one of you Tacking Feathers would but tell the World what your real Design was, they would be satisfy'd, but to be leaders in the Consolidator, and to Act without Meaning, without Thought or Design, must argue your' Fools, or worse, {{and you will find}} all the Moon of my Mind.|$|E
2500|$|Expression {{profiling}} is {{a logical}} next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the cell could possibly do, while the expression profile <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is actually doing {{at a point in}} time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from {{only a fraction of the}} genes it carries. [...] If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered [...] "on", otherwise [...] "off". [...] Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. [...] Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's simple enough," [...] remarked Jack. [...] "Spouter {{is going}} to invite us {{on some sort of}} outing this summer, but he doesn't want to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> yet <b>what</b> sort <b>it's</b> to be." ...|$|R
60|$|Isa. At {{least you}} will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> in <b>what</b> county <b>it</b> lies, that my cousin may send to enquire about it: come, this shall not serve your turn; <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> any town that's near it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We did know, however, {{that some}} mystery--some {{positive}} danger--overhung our father. He was very fearful {{of going out}} alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once light-weight champion of England. Our father would never <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was he feared, {{but he had a}} most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have since led us to change our opinion.|$|E
60|$|Why should Tancred go to Jerusalem? What does it signify to {{him whether}} there be {{religious}} truth or political justice? He has youth, beauty, rank, wealth, power, and all in excess. He has a mind that can comprehend their importance and appreciate their advantages. What more does he require? Unreasonable boy! And if he reach Jerusalem, {{why should he}} find religious truth and political justice there? He can read {{of it in the}} travelling books, written by young gentlemen, with the best letters of introduction to all the consuls. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, a third-rate city in a stony wilderness. Will the Providence of fashion prevent this great folly about to be perpetrated by one born to be fashion's most brilliant subject? A folly, too, which may end in a catastrophe? His parents, indeed, have appealed in vain; but the sneer of the world will do more than the supplication of the father. A mother's tear may be disregarded, but the sigh of a mistress has changed the most obdurate. We shall see. At present Lady Constance Rawleigh expresses her pleasure at Tancred's arrival, and his heart beats a little.|$|E
6000|$|What {{excellent}} order {{they kept}} about that vast depot! There was no frantic crowding and jostling, no shouting and swearing, and no swaggering intrusion of services by rowdy hackmen. These latter gentry stood outside--stood quietly by their {{long line of}} vehicles and said never a word. A kind of hackman general {{seemed to have the}} whole matter of transportation in his hands. He politely received the passengers and ushered them to the kind of conveyance they wanted, and told the driver where to deliver them. There was no [...] "talking back," [...] no dissatisfaction about overcharging, no grumbling about anything. In a little while we were speeding through the streets of Paris and delightfully recognizing certain names and places with which books had long ago made us familiar. It was like meeting an old friend when we read Rue de Rivoli on the street corner; we knew the genuine vast palace of the Louvre as well as we knew its picture; when we passed by the Column of July we needed no one to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was or to remind us that on its site once stood the grim Bastille, that grave of human hopes and happiness, that dismal prison house within whose dungeons so many young faces put on the wrinkles of age, so many proud spirits grew humble, so many brave hearts broke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed Nita, {{clasping}} {{her hands}} with a force peculiar to her demonstrative nature, [...] "how wonderful! How I do wish the Professor was here to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> be." ...|$|R
60|$|But having thus stated your holiness in {{its nature}} and essence, {{you come in}} the next place to <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> under <b>what</b> {{considerations}} <b>it</b> moveth a person to act, also by what rules and laws it squareth its acts and doings.|$|R
40|$|Time {{in written}} form pervades our social existence. From the daily news, whether {{on the web}} or in print, to wall {{calendars}} in our homes or offices, which <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> day <b>it</b> is; from personal watches or cellphones to public clocks, which <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> hour <b>it</b> is; from small change in our purses or pockets to use-by dates on our groceries, which remind us when things were made; and from personal or recreational diaries to bus and train timetables, which <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> when we did or should do things, we are constantly made aware of time and its passing in the modern world. And because of {{the means by which}} we tell the time in these contexts, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the ancient world did not have such persistent reminders as well. Yet archaeology and literature combine to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> differently. In this chapter I wish to discuss aspects of this combination, focusing on time in written forms, on the collocation of the mechanisms of time and writing, and on the spatial setting in which these are found, all of which demonstrate a politicization of time in the late Republic and early Empire...|$|R
