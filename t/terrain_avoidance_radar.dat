5000|$|The MH-47E {{has been}} used by U.S. Army Special Operations. Beginning with the E-model {{prototype}} manufactured in 1991, a total of 26 Special Operations Aircraft was produced. All aircraft were assigned to 2-160th SOAR(A) [...] "Nightstalkers", home based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. E models were conversions from existing CH-47C model airframes. The MH-47E has similar capabilities as the MH-47D, but includes an increased fuel capacity similar to the CH-47SD and <b>terrain</b> following/terrain <b>avoidance</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|R
50|$|The AN/APQ-181 is an all-weather, low {{probability}} of intercept (LPI) radar system designed by Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon) for the U.S. Air Force B-2A Spirit bomber aircraft. The system {{was developed in}} the mid-1980s and entered service in 1993. The APQ-181 provides a number of precision targeting modes, and also supports terrain-following <b>radar</b> and <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance.</b> The <b>radar</b> operates in the Ku band (a subset of the J band). The original design uses a TWT-based transmitter with a 2-dimensional passive electronically scanned array (PESA) antenna.|$|R

50|$|Dunn was {{the first}} son of {{educator}} Wendell E. Dunn, for many years principal of Forest Park High School in Baltimore, and brother of conductor Thomas Dunn. A graduate of Baltimore City College and Johns Hopkins University, Dunn was also awarded a doctorate in chemical engineering from Johns Hopkins. After completing the Harvard/MIT V12 program in 1944, he was engaged in aircraft <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>radar</b> research in both the U.S. and Occupied Germany. Dunn served as captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps until 1946.|$|E
50|$|The {{slow speeds}} {{necessary}} for the formations, 105 kn for the helicopters and 145 kn for the A-1s, degraded nearly all modes of the Combat Talon's AN/APQ-115 TF/TA navigational radars. The Terrain Following mode computed changes in altitude only to a programmed minimum airspeed of 160 kn, well outside {{the parameters of the}} mission. The Terrain Avoidance mode (adapted from the AN/APQ-99 <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>radar</b> of the RF-4C photo reconnaissance aircraft) was distorted by the nose-high attitude dictated by the slow speeds and would no longer display hazardous terrain directly in front of or below the Combat Talon's flight path. The Doppler radar (used to calculate wind drift and ground speed) often had to use information in its computer's memory because of processing lapses. While the ground-mapping radar (correlating landmarks shown on maps to radar returns) was not affected, the jungle terrain did not provide easily identifiable points. All of these handicaps were overcome with the external pod installation of FLIR, which readily identified the rivers and lakes used as turning points.|$|E
50|$|The {{squadron}} flies the CV-22 Osprey. Their {{mission is}} to provide long-range infiltration, exfiltration and resupply of non conventional special operation forces. The CV-22 is fitted with advanced electronic warfare systems, <b>terrain</b> following and <b>avoidance</b> <b>radars,</b> and navigation systems allowing them to operate under almost any adverse weather or time condition, to maximum efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the radar}} has the terrain {{following}} and <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> capabilities, {{they are rarely}} used, instead, it is compatible with navigational pods such as the Chinese Blue Sky low altitude navigation pod that enable the aircraft to have these two capabilities. The reason for using navigational pod with <b>terrain</b> following / <b>avoidance</b> <b>radar</b> in conjunction with JL-10A {{is to have a}} dedicated <b>terrain</b> following / <b>avoidance</b> mode purely for low level flight, while the fire control modes are continuous and separated from navigational modes such terrain following /avoidance, so that JL-10A would constantly stay at fire control modes instead of switching between <b>terrain</b> following / <b>avoidance</b> modes and other modes of operation. Unlike the much more advanced electronically scanned phased array airborne radars with each scan lasts only milliseconds, the JL-10A is a slotted planar array radar with each scan last from several seconds to a dozen seconds or greater, switching between different operational modes would take too long and thus deemed unacceptable under intense combat situations, so it would be far better to stay in the same operational mode to avoid any interruption under these situations. Reportedly, the <b>terrain</b> following / <b>avoidance</b> technology of JL-10A was developed from those originally obtained from captured terrain following radars from downed A-6 Intruder and General Dynamics F-111 during the Vietnam War.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores optimal {{path planning}} techniques for safe navigation of autonomous air vehicles. Finding trajectories for multiple vehicles {{moving in a}} dynamic environment while satisfying all constraints is a challenging problem. No single technique can be used independently for this problem. Different techniques for real time path planning have been developed and compared. First the problem was addressed using optimal control theory. Equations governing necessary conditions were derived for a combined objective of <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance,</b> <b>radar</b> avoidance and minimum path length. Using these equations, analytical solutions for radar risk minimization problem have been derived. A gradient method was used to get an optimal solution for different radar geometries. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation employing branch and bound techniques was investigated for both single and multiple autonomous air vehicle trajectory planning. A novel real-time receding horizon approach using MILP has been proposed that uses binary variables to model the soft and hard constraints for radar zones. A three dimensional probabilistic approach for the path planning unmanned air vehicles(UAVs) has been considered as well. For this approach a probabilistic cost function has been developed that accounts the various factors of fuel, collision, crash to ground objects etc. The novelty of the algorithm relies {{in its ability to}} be used in real time due to very low computational load {{in spite of the fact}} that it finds a path in three dimensions. The paths are locally optimal and are feasible for the UAV to follow. For graph-based global optimality, a software has been developed that includes extra subroutines to modify the already implemented Voronoi code in order to remove the infinity and far away nodes and also includes the corner points of the operational area. This software has been employed to find the Length Constraint Least Risk (LCLR) paths and also different techniques were compared...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> control methodology for autonomous rotorcraft applied to low altitude flight. A model predictive control formulation {{is used to}} adequately address the <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> problem, which involves stabilizing a nonlinear highly coupled dynamic model, while avoiding collisions with the terrain and preventing input and state saturations. Computing the model predictive control law amounts to solving a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem subject to the state difference equations that describe the rotorcraft nonlinear dynamic model. State and input saturations {{are added to the}} optimization cost functional as penalties and <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> is achieved by penalizing the distance between the vehicle and the closest point on the terrain, yielding smooth and collision-free trajectories. Simulation results, obtained with a simplified version of a small-scale helicopter nonlinear dynamic model, are presented to assess the performance of the methodology with different reference paths and terrain profiles, including the extreme case where a desired path leads to collision with the terrain...|$|R

The aim of the system is to detect the presence of obstacles (targets) in the surrounding area and in addition to determine their positions and ultimately follow their movements. The advantage of using radar for this purpose is that unlike the sensors based on other physical principles (optical, ultrasound), its performance is insensitive to the illumination level, atmospheric disturbances (like fog) or acoustic noise in the environment.

Instead, an incremental approach is proposed, where the combinations are evaluated only for the new peaks, while the peaks that were already associated with a target are only checked for validity [...] - this makes the operation {{an order of magnitude}} cheaper. 1.
