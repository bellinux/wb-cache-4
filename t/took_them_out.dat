5|$|The welcome {{extended}} by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was {{in contrast to}} that of Scotland. The morning they arrived in Belfast they were met by several IRFU officials who <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> for breakfast. The arrival in Ireland also marked a homecoming for the captain Dave Gallaher, {{who was born in}} County Donegal, but had moved to New Zealand at the age of four. Thousands awaited the All Blacks when they arrived in the Dublin train station. On the Thursday before the Test, both teams attended the theatre together; sitting alternatively so they could better mix.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} of the night saw Edge putting his World Heavyweight Championship on the line against The Undertaker. The early going of the match was slow-paced, in which both superstars countered each other's maneuvers. During the match, Undertaker ran and leapt over the top rope from the ring onto Edge on the outside. Then {{throughout}} the match, Edge was able to counter Undertaker's numerous signature moves, including the Chokeslam, Old School and the Last Ride, {{a variation of the}} powerbomb. Near the end, Edge hit Undertaker with a television camera while the referee was knocked down. When he proceeded to deliver a Tombstone Piledriver to Undertaker, Undertaker countered it into his own version and successfully delivered it to Edge for a two-count. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder came to the ring for Edge's aid, but Undertaker <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> Because of their distraction, Edge was able to execute a spear on Undertaker, but was unable to pin him. When Edge delivered another spear to Undertaker, Undertaker applied Hell's Gate and forced Edge to submit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, improving his WrestleMania record to 16–0.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} season {{back in the}} League, the club {{attained}} a twelfth-placed finish despite suffering their record defeat; 10–1 at Small Heath. The referee blew the whistle for time four minutes early, with the score 9–1, and did not realise until the players had reached the dressing room and the crowd had all left. He <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> for the remaining four minutes, during which Small Heath scored a tenth goal. No joy was to be had in the FA Cup yet again.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} herds and flocks. The flocks were {{committed}} to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when {{they ought to have}} been folded, he paid twelvefold.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} {{liquidation}} of the Ghetto {{in the course}} of the murderous Operation Reinhard in Kraków under Holocaust perpetrator Amon Göth, Maria Błeszyńska Bernstein escaped from there at night with her three-year-old daughter. They were rescued by Jerzy Zakulski. He engaged his whole family in the rescue mission including his father-in-law Jan Bahr, hiding Maria and her child in both households by turns. Eventually, they <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the city to a safer place of a cousin Zofia Strycharska in Myślenice. Both Maria and her daughter survived the war and returned to Kraków afterwards. In her letter to the Stalinist military court in Warsaw dated 23 June 1947, Maria, living at 32 Długa street at the time, insisted that the Zakulskis had all risked their lives to save theirs.|$|E

500|$|Stone did not {{audition}} actors {{until spring}} 1969, {{a few weeks}} before five shows, designed to test the show's appeal to children and to examine their comprehension of the material, were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and researcher Ed Palmer <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the [...] "most enthusiastic thumbs up" [...] were cast. For example, when the children saw Long's audition, they stood up and sang along with her rendition of [...] "I'm a Little Teapot". As Stone said, casting was the only aspect of the show that was [...] "just completely haphazard". Most of the cast and crew found jobs on Sesame Street through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.|$|E
500|$|Many in the YouTube community, {{including}} Ethan Klein of h3h3Productions, a Jewish YouTube sketch comedian, {{who is also}} {{friends with}} PewDiePie, as well as YouTube news commentator Philip DeFranco, and popular gamers Markiplier and Jacksepticeye, {{as well as many}} others, defended PewDiePie and criticised the way media handled the incident. On 16 February, PewDiePie himself responded in a video entitled My Response, in which he apologised to those who were offended by his previous videos and which he also criticised the reporting by the media. He also states The Wall Street Journal framed his jokes as [...] "posts" [...] and <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of context. One of the examples PewDiePie gives of this includes one of his vlogs, in which he expresses frustration at people creating swastikas in his Tuber Simulator video game.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in October 1993, but was delayed because Crowe was busy on another film in Australia. Principal photography for The Quick and the Dead lasted from November 21, 1993 to February 27, 1994. Locations included Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and Mescal, 40 miles southeast of Tucson. Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems. Thell Reed, who was hired as the gun coach and weapons master, worked with the cast through over three months of training. To age Cort's Colt 1851 Navy Revolver and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures. [...] "I <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust," [...] he explained. [...] "They looked rusty and old, but were brand new guns." [...] Such detail, including the nickel plating and ivory handles on Ellen's Colt Peacemakers, was accurate to the time period.|$|E

500|$|Yankovic {{first started}} {{performing}} [...] "Headline News" [...] in August 1994, {{almost a month}} before it was officially released. In addition, Yankovic has performed the song with the Crash Test Dummies twice: once on Canada's MuchMusic channel and another time at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. Reportedly, {{during one of the}} performances, Ellen Reid, backing vocalist and keyboardist for the Crash Test Dummies, went out and purchased kazoos. The band then hid the instruments {{until the end of the}} song, when they <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> and played them; this [...] "came as a big surprise to" [...] Yankovic. Yankovic's Straight Outta Lynwood concert tour contained new lyrics as part of a parody medley, referencing Britney Spears, dealing with her 2007 head-shaving shock and underpants-less limousine trip in late 2006. Later in the tour, he changed it to reference Paris Hilton's DUI and imprisonment, and her subsequent interview on Larry King Live.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{producers}} decided against depending upon a single host for Sesame Street, instead casting {{a group of}} ethnically diverse actors, they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, [...] "a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities", both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority, was responsible for hiring the show's first cast. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, {{a few weeks before}} the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the [...] "most enthusiastic thumbs up" [...] were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of [...] "I'm a Little Teapot".

Most of the cast and crew found jobs on Sesame Street through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.|$|E
500|$|No 49 Squadron {{had eight}} Valiants, but only four deployed: XD818, piloted by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard, the {{squadron}} commander; XD822, piloted by Squadron Leader L. D. (Dave) Roberts; XD823, piloted by Squadron Leader Arthur Steele; and XD824, piloted by Squadron Leader Barney Millett. The other four Valiants remained at RAF Wittering, {{where they were}} used as courier aircraft for bomb components. The last components for Short Granite were delivered by Valiant courier on 10 May 1957—three days late owing to severe head winds between San Francisco and Honolulu. A full-scale rehearsal was held on 11 May, and on 14 May {{it was decided to}} conduct the Grapple 1 test the following day. The eight official observers—two each from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States—were flown from Honolulu to Christmas Island in a Handley Page Hastings, then to Malden Island in a Dakota, from whence a DUKW <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> to HMS Alert, the spectator ship. All but a small party were evacuated from Malden by HMS Warrior, Narvik and Messina by 19:00 on 14 May. The rest were picked up by a helicopter from Warrior at 07:45 on 15 May. Oulton and Cook arrived on Malden by Dakota at 08:25, where they were met by a helicopter and taken to Narvik.|$|E

500|$|Around 3:00am on 12 January 1964, 600–800 poorly armed, mainly African insurgents, {{aided by}} some of the {{recently}} dismissed ex-policemen, attacked Unguja's police stations, both of its police armouries, and the radio station. The attackers had no arms, being equipped only with spears, knives, machetes, and tire irons, having only the advantage of numbers and surprise. The Arab police replacements had received almost no training and, despite responding with a mobile force, were soon overcome. Okello himself led the attack on the Ziwani police HQ, which also happened to be the largest armory on the island. Several of the rebels were shot down, but the police were overwhelmed by sheer numbers, with Okello impressing his men with his courage by personally attacking a police sentry and having wrestled his rifle from him, used it to bayonet the policeman to death. [...] Arming themselves with hundreds of captured automatic rifles, submachine guns and Bren guns, the insurgents took control of strategic buildings in the capital, Zanzibar Town. At about 7:00 am, Okello made his first radio broadcast from a local radio station his followers had captured two hours earlier, calling upon the Africans to rise up and overthrow the [...] "imperialists". At the time, Okello only referred to himself as [...] "the field marshal", which prompted much speculation on Zanzibar about just who was this mysterious figure leading the revolution who spoke his Swahili with a thick Acholi accent, which sounded very strange on Zanzibar. Within six hours of the outbreak of hostilities, the town's telegraph office and main government buildings were under revolutionary control, and the island's only airstrip was captured at 2:18pm. In the countryside, fighting had erupted between the Manga as the rural Arabs were called, and the Africans. The Manga were armed with their hunting rifles, and once the arms seized from the police stations reached the rebels in the countryside, the Manga were doomed. In Stone Town, the most fiercest resistance was at the Malindi police station, where under the command of Police Commissioner J.M Sullivan (a British policeman who stayed on until a local replacement could be hired), all of the rebel attacks were repulsed, not least because the insurgents tended to retreat whenever they came under fire. Sullivan only surrendered the Melindi station late in the afternoon after running out of ammunition, and marched his entire force (not one policeman had been killed or wounded) down to the Stonetown wharf to board some boats that <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> to a ship, the Salama to take them away from Zanzibar. Throughout Stone Town, shops and homes owned by Arabs and South Asians had been looted while numerous Arab and South Asian women were gang-raped. The Sultan, together with Prime Minister Muhammad Shamte Hamadi and members of the cabinet, fled the island on the royal yacht Seyyid Khalifa, and the Sultan's palace and other property was seized by the revolutionary government. At least 80 people were killed and 200 injured, the majority of whom were Arabs, during the 12 hours of street fighting that followed. Sixty-one American citizens, including 16 men staffing a NASA satellite tracking station, sought sanctuary in the English Club in Zanzibar Town, and four US journalists were detained by the island's new government.|$|E
