50|$|Hamilton’s {{arguments}} are {{a response to}} anti-federalist arguments against the new constitution and the strong central government that it implied. The anti-federalists feared that the national government would weaken their individual states and that national debts would burden the country, and were particularly concerned with the executive branch, arguing that it would eventually become a monarchy or dictatorship. People questioned why Hamilton and the Federalists would propose a constitution that created an executive branch that seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>way</b> too much power. America was coming off the revolution where they fought England to gain independence from an oppressive government who they believed had too much power. People were concerned that this new executive branch would destroy the freedom that they just fought and died for. Another major fear was that the executive would have too much say in the senate. They thought the executive would be controlling from behind the scenes and appointing whoever they wanted to congress. Hamilton set out to prove that these fears were something {{not to worry about}} because the executive branch would be tightly regulated.|$|E

40|$|Summary of this report: Replanning {{a service}} {{composition}} offers {{a way to}} dynamically answer {{to the need for}} reconfigurability that often arises in an open word where the services we exploit are not under our direct control and we need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>way</b> to quickly reconfigure our system. In this situation, the possibility of performing some on the fly testing would allow us to understand if the new services we want to exploit actually behave as foreseen. In this deliverable we focus on a specific kind of replanning, that is, the possibility SeCSE 511680 to dynamically bind to services that offer a syntactic interface that is not completely compatible with the service request issued by the service consumer. We also discuss about possible testing techniques {{that could be used in}} these cases...|$|E
40|$|Resumen: Partiendo de la idea de que el Vaticano II quiso ser un diálogo con la modernidad, el autor comienza señalado (el «ver» en la medotología latinoamericana) los grandes cambios de paradigma que se han sucedido en estos 50 años posteriores al Concilio: la revolución de la posmodernidad, el despertar de la conciencia política y la irrupción de la teología de la liberación, la nueva conciencia pluralista, el descubrimiento de la ecología profunda, la crisis de las «religiones agrarias» en un mundo que parece querer entrar en un mundo «post-religioso», y la transformación de la epistemología religiosa tradicional. En un segundo momento («juzgar») analiza lo que sucedió con el Vaticano II y el posconcilio: las transformaciones que propuso, la oposición que fue creciendo apoyándose en el propio poder jerárquico institucional, y el impase de la actual falta de diálogo. En una tercera parte («actuar») el autor propone unas pistas interpretativas como la mejor forma de aportar a una situación eclesial actual que parece no tener salida. Palabras clave: Diagnóstico teológico. Vaticano II. Concilio. Iglesia. Futuro. Cambio de Paradigma Abstract: Starting {{from the}} idea that Vatican II wanted to stablish a {{dialogue}} with the modernity, the author starts pointing out (the «see», in the Latin American methodology) the big changes of paradigm which have taken place in these last 50 years after the Council: the revolution of pos-modernity, the waking up of the politic conscienceand the irruption of the theology of Liberation, the new conscience of cultural and religious pluralism, the discovery of the depp ecology, the crisis of the «agrarian religions» in a world which seems to want enter into e post-religious world, and the transformation of the traditional religious epistemology.         In a second moment («judge») analizes what happened in the Vatican II and the pos-council: the transformations it proposed, the growing oposition, taking advantage in the jrearquical institutional power, and the current impasse of the lack of dialogue.         In the third part («act»), the author proposes some interpretative tracks, as the best way to contribute to this current ecclesial situation which seems not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>way</b> out.
