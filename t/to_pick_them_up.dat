5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|Key issues include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the {{cameraman}} stopped filming at that point. Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c.17minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film {{of the death of}} the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Pye strip {{was such}} an advance on the EMI unit that the EF50 became a key {{strategic}} component. As a German invasion of the west loomed in 1940, the British contacted Philips and arranged a plan to remove the company's board of directors to the UK, along with 25,000 more EF50s and another 250,000 bases, onto which Mullard, Philip's UK subsidiary, could build complete tubes. A destroyer, , was dispatched <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> in May, and left the Netherlands only days before the German invasion on 15 May 1940. The Pye strip, and its 45MHz intermediate frequency, would be re-used in many other wartime radar systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{reversal}} of course {{brought her back}} in range of the British battlecruisers, however, which quickly opened fire and scored several damaging hits. The order to abandon ship was given, and men began gathering on the deck. Engineers set scuttling charges while the men topside prepared {{to go into the}} water. At 14:25, the ship rolled over and sank. The survivors expected the British <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up,</b> but they instead departed. German ships searched the area three days later, to find only one survivor, Leading Stoker Neumann; {{the rest of the crew}} had died in the water. The wreck was moved in August 1979 to render it less of an underwater hazard. Some parts of the ship were salvaged and are now preserved in the Cuxhaven Shipwreck Museum.|$|E
5|$|While {{repairing}} one of {{the heat}} generators, Humphreys catches an eco-terrorist named Doug Spinney. He tells the group that there's a deadly swarm of insects in the forest and that they must avoid darkness to stay alive. The next morning, they find an old-growth tree cut down with an unexplained band of green contained within its growth rings. Spinney suspects that an organism that was dormant in the tree for centuries was disturbed when the tree was illegally cut down. Humphreys hikes down to Moore's truck, but is killed by the swarm at nightfall. In the cabin, everyone else is kept safe by the light. The next morning, Spinney convinces Mulder to let him hike to his colleagues with gasoline so he can return with a Jeep <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> Scully and Moore confront Mulder, since this will leave them with little fuel for the generator.|$|E

50|$|Interaction {{with objects}} was limited <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> or {{dropping}} <b>them,</b> {{at which point}} other characters might interact with them as well.

Twenty-seven survivors were clinging to the small boats and pieces of floating wreckage. Senecas No. 1 lifeboat with Third Lieutenant F. W.

25|$|In February 1942, as Japanese forces {{tightened}} {{their grip}} on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to Australia. MacArthur discussed the idea with his staff that he resign his commission and fight on as a private soldier in the Philippine resistance but Sutherland talked him out of it. On the night of March 12, 1942, MacArthur and a select group (that included his wife Jean and son Arthur, as well as Sutherland, Akin, Casey, Marshall, Willoughby, Diller, and George) left Corregidor in four PT boats. MacArthur, his family and Sutherland traveled in PT 41, commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley. The others followed in PT 34, PT 35 and PT 32. MacArthur and his party reached Del Monte Airfield in Bukidnon province {{on the island of}} Mindanao two days later.

25|$|The steel barque Anjou ran ashore on Auckland Island on 5 February 1905. The 22 {{crew members}} made it ashore in Carnley Harbour on {{three of the}} ship's boats after rowing against strong currents. Ten days later they reached the depot at Camp Cove, which {{provided}} them with ample supplies {{as well as the}} shipping schedule of the Hinemoa so they knew how long they would have to wait for rescue. Captain Le Tellac commended the provisions that the government had left for the castaways, without which they would not have survived. (It was noted, however, that some of the supplies that should have been there were missing; these were later recovered from the house of a Mr Glenning, a lessee of the island.) Reaching Norman Inlet on 7 May, Captain Bollons of the Hinemoa noticed signs that there were castaways, located them, and was able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> from the island and carry them to Dunedin.

25|$|The air-sea rescue squadrons of the ASRS flew {{a variety}} of aircraft, usually hand me downs {{rejected}} or withdrawn from front line service by the RAF's other branches or {{as in the case}} of the Walrus begged from the Navy. They used Supermarine Spitfires and Boulton Paul Defiants to patrol for downed aircrew and Avro Ansons to drop supplies and dinghies. Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious craft were used to pick up aircrew from the water. Larger aircraft were used to drop airborne lifeboats. Although the Walrus and Sea Otters could pick up survivors in calm seas, further out to sea and in rougher waters, it was still not possible for aircraft to routinely pick up survivors, the large flying boats that could do so, such as the Catalinas and Short Sunderlands of Coastal Command, had many other jobs to do and were not always available. The role of aircraft in the ASRS therefore, was to locate downed airmen and to keep them alive, by dropping them survival equipment and stores, until an ASRS launch, or one from the Royal Navy's Naval Sea Rescue Services, arrived <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> Generally MCS launches had responsibility for the Channel and North Sea, and Navy ones for the Western Approaches.|$|E
25|$|Passed {{out to the}} {{occasional}} friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli {{had just returned from}} Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor Régis Debray. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution {{he did not have to}} pay.|$|E
