25|$|In that version, Set held {{a banquet}} for Osiris {{in which he}} brought in a {{beautiful}} box and said that whoever could fit in the box perfectly would get to keep it. Set had measured Osiris in his sleep and made {{sure that he was}} the only one who could fit the box. Several tried to see whether they fit. Once it was Osiris's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he could fit in the box, Set closed the lid on him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E
2500|$|As they battle, a roar {{is heard}} {{from above and}} they both <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Aslan and a fresh army [...] of Narnian {{reinforcements}} arrive to join the battle, to the Witch's shock that Aslan is alive after she personally slew him. As some of the White Witch's tired soldiers are trampled by ground shaking wave of Aslan's reinforcements, Mr. Tumnus knocks down a goblin with another lion running {{next to him and}} Rumblebuffin uses his club on two minotaurs. Peter and the White Witch continue to fight and the White Witch gains the upper hand, tripping Peter to the ground with her sword, pins his arm to the ground, and knocks his shield out of his hand. Just as she prepares to kill him, Aslan charges at the White Witch and knocks her back, as she barely has time to look up and see him pounce at her. A moment of eerie peace ensues as the Witch accepts her doom and Aslan decapitates her. As the reinforcements charge past to scour the battlefield, Aslan tells Peter that [...] "It is finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elsie arrives joyfully for {{her wedding}} {{to the man}} she still knows as [...] "Leonard", but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives. [...] Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught {{over the loss of}} [...] "Leonard", does not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his face. [...] He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute. [...] Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, [...] "Leonard", but he says that his heart is like a [...] "massive rock" [...] and claims her as his bride. [...] Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally {{recognises}} him as her adored one. [...] All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid, with wrenching sorrow. [...] Elsie [...] "drops a tear" [...] for Point, but turns back to her love. [...] As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible at their feet.|$|E
60|$|There was {{movement}} in the doorways. Ernest, the Speaker, all the members <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
60|$|A grief-stricken whisper caught Jim's ear. He <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Kate's wide, {{questioning}} {{eyes fixed}} upon him.|$|R
60|$|The doorway darkened, and she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the figure}} of her brother black in the light.|$|R
6000|$|Turn, Angelina, ever dear, [...] My charmer, <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] Thy own, thy long-lost Edwin here, [...] Restored to {{love and}} thee, [...] GOLDSMITH.|$|E
6000|$|McFarlane then said: [...] "I'll {{just take}} a little <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the horses are all right, and then I think we'd better close in for the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is {{the white}} man?" [...] cried the guard of Xodar. [...] "Issus {{commands}} his presence." [...] He started to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if I were {{in another part of}} the cell.|$|E
60|$|Fred <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a {{dozen of}} those who had been at work near him, {{advancing}} threateningly.|$|R
60|$|Then all {{was past}} and over, and he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the old imaum {{standing}} at his side.|$|R
60|$|Newman instinctively <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if {{the little}} paper {{was in fact}} consumed; {{but there was nothing}} left of it.|$|R
60|$|Not {{until it}} was {{repeated}} more loudly, and imperatively, did he <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Fortunio beckoning him. With a sudden dread anxiety, he stepped to the captain's side. Was he discovered? But Fortunio's words set his doubts to rest at once.|$|E
6000|$|Allie Lee had {{believed}} {{many times that}} her heart was breaking, but now she knew it had never broken till then. Why did he not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her waiting there--stricken motionless and voiceless, wild to give the lie to those cold, strange words? ...|$|E
60|$|Joe Lake muttered low and deep, {{and this}} time there was no mistake about the nature of his speech. Shefford did not have the courage to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what had caused these exclamations. He knew since today had dawned that there was {{calamity}} in the air.|$|E
60|$|Rosamund {{bowed her}} head and wept; then, hearing a sound behind her, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Masouda was weeping also.|$|R
60|$|Joe felt, {{rather than}} heard, the {{approach}} of some one, and he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Wetzel coming down the path.|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Grayson approaching. <b>To</b> her {{surprise}} {{he seemed to}} hold no resentment whatsoever. She greeted him courteously.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Bascum, but he didn't {{know any}} thing. Why, where's Sanch?" [...] said Ben, returning. A breathless voice made Bab <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ben looking about him {{with as much}} alarm in his hot face as if the dog had been a two years' child.|$|E
6000|$|So saying, he quickened his pace, the dog hanging behind, {{until he}} {{approached}} almost {{close to the}} figure, when, with a wild howl, away Trotty fled down the hillside. As Gabriel drew still closer, {{he saw that the}} object wore a long light cloak and hood, and a large coal-scuttle bonnet; and surprised to find that the sound of his footsteps did not cause her to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who was following, he called out: ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the echoes}} of Hassan's whistle died away there was a crash amongst the wooden {{shutters}} of the window behind them, and down into the room leaped a long, lithe figure, holding an axe aloft. Before Sir Andrew could <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whence the sound came, that axe dealt him a fearful blow between the shoulders which, although the ringed mail remained unshorn, shattered his spine beneath. Down he fell, rolled on to his back, and lay there, still able to speak and without pain, but helpless as a child. For he was paralysed, and never more would move hand or foot or head.|$|E
60|$|The {{little girl}} stood still to watch until the train had {{disappeared}} around a curve; then she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where she was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{could it}} have been?" [...] whispered Jane Porter, {{and the young man}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her standing, wide-eyed and wondering, close beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, she's gone!" [...] exclaimed the boy, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{his companions}} still waving {{their hands in}} token of adieu to the {{vanished}} Polychrome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on!" [...] {{commanded}} Curtis, and Two Horns {{brought the}} whip {{down on the}} horses. As they sprang forward a wail of agony burst from the lips of the bereaved young wife. At this cry Cut Finger again turned upon the agent with hands opened like the claws of a bear--his face contorted with despair. Curtis seized him in a grip whose crunching power made itself felt to the marrow of the Tetong's bones, and his eyes, piercing with terrible determination, shrivelled {{the resolution of the}} half-crazed man. He sank back into his seat, a hopeless lump of swaying flesh, his face a tragic mask, and uttered no further word till the sound of a galloping horse made them all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who followed.|$|E
60|$|Days {{passed and}} nights passed, {{as if on}} wings. Every waking hour drew him closer to this {{incomparable}} girl who had arisen upon his horizon like a star. He knew the hour was imminent when he must read his heart. He fought it off; he played with his bliss. Allie was now his shadow instead of the faithful Larry, although the cowboy was often with them, adapting himself to the changed conditions, too big and splendid to be envious or jealous. They fished down the brook, and always at the never-to-be-forgotten ford he would cross first and <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her follow. She could never understand why Neale would delight in carrying her across at other points, yet made her ford this one by herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes; I hear, Man-cub." [...] Bagheera {{rolled over}} hurriedly and sat up, the dust on his ragged black flanks. (He was just casting his winter coat.) [...] "We be surely the Masters of the Jungle! Who {{is so strong}} as Mowgli? Who so wise?" [...] There was a curious drawl in the voice that made Mowgli <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether by any chance the Black Panther were making fun of him, for the Jungle is full of words that sound like one thing, but mean another. [...] "I said we be beyond {{question}} the Masters of the Jungle," [...] Bagheera repeated. [...] "Have I done wrong? I {{did not know that}} the Man-cub no longer lay upon the ground. Does he fly, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If {{eggs are}} not too dear here we can pay,” said Appleby, with a laugh, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Harper was glancing at him reproachfully.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} Antoine, the guide, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what {{detained}} the party, and instantly uttered a loud shout of alarm {{as he ran}} back to them.|$|R
60|$|Both <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> The Sheik {{standing}} {{a few paces}} from them. Abdul still held the picture in his hand. Now he thrust it within his burnous.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I'm so glad! How sweet {{of you to}} come down!" [...] It was a voice {{close to}} Count Otto's {{shoulder}} that spoke these words, and he had no need to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> from whom it proceeded. It had been in his ears the greater part of the day, though, as he now perceived, without the fullest richness of expression of which it was capable. Still less was he obliged to turn to discover to whom it was addressed, for the few simple words I have quoted had been flung across the narrowing interval of water, and a gentleman who had stepped {{to the edge of the}} dock without our young man's observing him tossed back an immediate reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{a fool of}} a cabman, {{standing}} outside a public house, made a sudden rush for this, and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence under the ear. I let the whole down with a smash on the cabman, and then, with shouts and the clatter of feet about me, people coming out of shops, vehicles pulling up, I realised what I had done for myself, and cursing my folly, backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion. In a moment I should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered. I pushed by a butcher boy, who luckily did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the nothingness that shoved him aside, and dodged behind the cab-man's four-wheeler. I {{do not know how}} they settled the business. I hurried straight across the road, which was happily clear, and hardly heeding which way I went, in the fright of detection the incident had given me, plunged into the afternoon throng of Oxford Street.|$|E
60|$|But what a {{crowd of}} {{memories}} come back, bringing with them the perfume of fallen days! What delights and glamour, what long hours of effort, discouragements, and secret fears did he not watch over--our black familiar; and with the sight and scent and touch of him, deepen or assuage! How many thousand walks did we not go together, so that we still <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he is following at his padding gait, attentive to the invisible trails. Not the least hard thing to bear when they go from us, these quiet friends, is that they carry away with them {{so many years of}} our own lives. Yet, if they find warmth therein, who would grudge them those years that they have so guarded? Nothing else of us can they take to lie upon with outstretched paws and chin pressed to the ground; and, whatever they take, be sure they have deserved.|$|E
60|$|Ethel Lennox turned {{abruptly}} and silently and walked swiftly across the sand. Agnes felt her arm touched, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ethel standing, pale and erect, beside her.|$|R
60|$|Jess <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{what would}} happen. She knew the whole story, and {{hoped he would}} take the man's hand; next, remembering their position, she hoped that he would.|$|R
60|$|Then Mrs. Wrapp came down. Rising, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a large woman, elaborately gowned. She had a heavy, rather good-natured face {{on which}} was a smile of greeting.|$|R
