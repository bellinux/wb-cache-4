Illustrative experiments were performed in a model system with beta-type crystals of <b>tripalmitin</b> as the solid phase and <b>tripalmitin,</b> a fraction of it deuterated, dissolved in a medium-chain TG oil as the liquid phase. The concentration of deuterated <b>tripalmitin</b> in the solvent was followed by H- 2 NMR after the crystals, which initially lack deuterated <b>tripalmitin,</b> were immersed in the liquid. The variation of the H- 2 concentration in the solvent provided the surface specific exchange rate.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} lipid phase composition on the crystallization, polymorphic transition and stability of solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) suspensions. A series of fine-disperse oil-in-water emulsions was prepared at an elevated temperature (75 °C) from a lipid phase containing different amounts of a high melting lipid (<b>tripalmitin)</b> and a low melting lipid (fish oil). These emulsions were cooled to induce crystallization and form SLN suspensions. In the absence of fish oil, the SLN suspensions formed a gel after the emulsified <b>tripalmitin</b> crystallized, which was attributed to particle shape changes leading to aggregation and network formation. Light scattering and rheology measurements indicated that incorporation of fish oil into the lipid phase (≥ 10 wt %) increased the stability of SLN to aggregation. DSC measurements suggested that crystallization, melting, and polymorphic transitions of SLN were influenced {{by the amount of}} fish oil incorporated. The rate of α- to β-polymorphic transitions of <b>tripalmitin</b> increased with increasing fish oil content, and <b>tripalmitin</b> crystals formed appeared to be less ordered as evidence by a lower melting temperature. Results suggest that the phase behavior and morphology of <b>tripalmitin</b> crystals can be altered by mixing them with low melting lipids such as fish oil thereby improving the stability of SLN suspensions to particle aggregation and gelation. Moreover, results show that fish oil, rich in ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can be successfully incorporated into SLN suspensions...|$|E
40|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{analysis of}} the crystallisation behaviour of palm oil was performed using low-resolution magnetic pulsed nuclear resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, polarised light microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the changes induced in the crystallisation of palm oil by the addition of two different levels of <b>tripalmitin</b> and two different types of monoacylglycerols. The addition of monoacylglycerols led to the formation of a large number of crystallisation nuclei without changing the final solids content, accelerating the process of crystal formation, leading to the formation of smaller crystals than those found in the refined palm oil. Higher levels of <b>tripalmitin</b> produced crystals with larger dimensions, reducing the induction period and resulted in a higher level of solids at the end of the crystallisation period. The addition of monoacylglycerols and <b>tripalmitin</b> induced the formation of a polymorphic beta-form. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{suspensions}} of platelet-like shaped <b>tripalmitin</b> nanocrystals are studied here at high <b>tripalmitin</b> concentrations (10 wt % <b>tripalmitin)</b> for {{the first}} time by a combination of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS). The suspensions are stabilized by different lecithins, namely, DLPC, DOPC, and the lecithin blend S 100. At such high concentrations the platelets start to self-assemble in stacks, which causes interference maxima at low Q-values in the SAXS and SANS patterns, respectively. It is found that the stack-related interference maxima are more pronounced for the suspension stabilized with DOPC and in particular DLPC, compared to suspensions stabilized by S 100. By use of the X-ray and neutron powder pattern simulation analysis (XNPPSA), the SAXS and SANS patterns of the native <b>tripalmitin</b> suspensions could only be reproduced simultaneously when assuming the presence of both isolated nanocrystals and stacks of nanocrystals of different size in the simulation model of the dispersions. By a fit of the simulated SAXS and SANS patterns to the experimental data, a distribution of the stack sizes and their volume fractions is determined. The volume fraction of stacklike platelet assemblies is found to rise from 70 % for S 100 -stabilized suspensions to almost 100 % for the DLPC-stabilized suspensions. The distribution of the platelet thicknesses could be determined with molecular resolution from a combined analysis of the SAXS and SANS patterns of the corresponding diluted <b>tripalmitin</b> (3 wt %) suspensions. In accordance with microcalorimetric data, it could be concluded that the platelets in the suspensions stabilized with DOPC, and in particular DLPC, are significantly thinner than those stabilized with S 100. The DLPC-stabilized suspensions exhibit a significantly narrower platelet thickness distribution compared to DOPC- and S 100 -stabilized suspensions. The smaller thicknesses for the DLPC- and DOPC-stabilized platelets explain their higher tendency to self-assemble in stacks. The finding that the nanoparticles of the suspension stabilized by the saturated lecithin DLPC crystallize in the stable β-tripalmitin modification with its characteristic platelet-like shape is surprising and {{can be explained by the}} fact that the main phase transformation temperature for DLPC is, as for unsaturated lecithins like DOPC and S 100, well below the crystallization temperature of the supercooled <b>tripalmitin</b> emulsion droplets...|$|E

This study aims at the production of HMF substitutes rich in omega- 3 polyunsaturated FA, by enzyme-catalyzed acidolysis of <b>tripalmitin</b> with FA of camelina oil, in batch reactor and solvent-free media. An immobilized commercial lipase (“Lipozyme RM IMTM”) and a non-commercial heterologous Rhizopus oryzae lipase (rROL) were tested, as thermostable and sn- 1, 3 selective lipases. After 24 h reaction at 60 ºC, molar incorporations of 50. 3 % for "Lipozyme RM IMTM", 43. 3 % for rROL in Lewatit VPOC 1600 and 19. 5 % for rROL in ReliZyme OD 403 /S were obtained. rROL immobilized in Lewatit was selected {{as an alternative to}} commercial lipases.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{investigation}} and improvement of washing cotton, soiled with triglycerides at room temperature. Therefore the wash efficiency determining interactions were identified {{and the influence of}} structures and viscosity of washing agent and temperature on the laundry results determined. To increase systematically the soil release two different strategies were applied. On the one hand we tried {{to increase the amount of}} released triglyceride and the other hand we tried to decrease the Krafft temperature of surfactants. The interaction of triglyceride and surfactant in a binary mixture could result in a decreased melting point or enthalpy. Accordingly, triglyceride liquefaction by surfactants during washing process was supposed. Therefore the influence of surfactants on the phase behavior of triolein and <b>tripalmitin</b> was determined by DSC. The former one is liquid and the latter one is crystalline at room temperature. The investigated surfactants were either anionic or non-ionic. The anionic surfactants were Lutensit A-LBN, a commonly used linear alkyl-benzene sulfonate and choline hexadecylsulphate, a housemade surfactant. The non-ionic surfactants were Lutensol GD 70, an alkyl polyglucoside and three different types of Lutensol AOx, C 13 C 15 alcohols differing in the number of ethoxy groups with x = 3, 7 and 20. It was found that only non-ionic surfactants, Lutensol AOx, interact with triglyceride. The polymorphism of triglycerides disappears, therefore, the surfactants have an influence on the preferred trigylceride morphology. However, only for very high concentrations of Lutensol AO 3 and Lutensol AO 7 a slight reduction of triplamitin melting point was determined. Admittedly, the liquefaction of triglyceride with surfactants at room temperature was not reached. If <b>tripalmitin</b> is not liquefied by surfactants it might get dissolved from cotton by solvents during washing process. Therefore, in a subsequent step the solubilisation of triglycerides by various solvents was investigated. For a systematical selection of potentially suited solvents the Ra value was calculated from Hansen solubility parameters. However, it was found that experimental and calculated data are not in good accordance. Accordingly, solid/liquid equilibrium (SLE) calculations by COSMO-RS were performed giving results which agree in a better way with experimental data. SLE calculations enable a ranking of solvents due to their <b>tripalmitin</b> solubilisation power. The main difference in COSMO-RS and Ra value calculations is the unconsidered crystallization enthalpy of <b>tripalmitin</b> for calculating the Ra-value. The calculated Ra-values of binary mixtures of liquid triolein and solvents are in good agreement with experimental data. Therefore, we assume that Hansen solubility parameters are not suitable for the prediction of crystalline triglyceride solubilisation. Nevertheless, only small amounts of <b>tripalmitin</b> were dissolved in the tested solvents. The best solvent was chloroform, dissolving 22 wt...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether temperature scanning ultrasonic velocity measurements could be used to monitor the complex thermal transitions that occur during the crystallization and melting of triglyceride solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). Ultrasonic velocity (u) measurements were compared with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements on <b>tripalmitin</b> emulsions that were cooled (from 75 to 5 °C) and then heated (from 5 to 75 °C) at 0. 3 °C min− 1. There was an excellent correspondence between the thermal transitions observed in δΔu/δT versus temperature curves determined by ultrasound and heat flow versus temperature curves determined by DSC. In particular, both techniques were sensitive to the complex melting behavior of the solidified <b>tripalmitin,</b> which was attributed to the dependence of the melting point of the SLNs on particle size. These studies suggest that temperature scanning ultrasonic velocity measurements may prove to be a useful alternative to conventional DSC techniques for monitoring phase transitions in colloidal systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to induce crystallization in enzymatically interesterified fats (IE) with 20 and 30 % palmitic acid at the sn- 2 position using high intensity ultrasound (HIU). The physical blends (PB) used to prepare these two IE were consisted of <b>tripalmitin</b> and high oleic sunflower oil and contained 13. 2 and 27. 1 % <b>tripalmitin,</b> respectively. Crystallization behavior of IE was compared with PB at supercoolings of 9, 6 and 3 °C. Results show that the melting point, SFC, and crystallization rate of PB were higher than IE and were driven mainly by <b>tripalmitin</b> content. HIU induced crystallization and generated small crystals in the IE samples. At 9 °C supercooling, sonication did not increase the viscosity of IE C 16 : 0 20 %, while that of the IE C 16 : 0 30 % increased significantly from 192. 4 ± 118. 9 to 3297. 7 ± 1368. 6 Pa·s. The elastic modulus (G’) for IE C 16 : 0 30 % increased from 12521 ± 2739. 8 to 75076. 7 ± 18259 Pa upon sonication at 9 °C supercooling, while the G’ of the IE C 16 : 0 20 % did not increase. Similar behavior was observed for the other supercoolings tested. This research suggests that HIU can improve the functional properties of IE with low content of C 16 : 0 creating more viscous and elastic materials.

Two-step extrusion was performed, which comprised an initial extrusion step of drug and one matrix component followed by milling these extrudates and a second extrusion step for the milled extrudates mixed with the second matrix component. Initial extrusion with polyethylene glycol led to increased dissolution rates, while initial extrusion with <b>tripalmitin</b> led to decreased dissolution rates compared to the dissolution characteristics of extrudates containing the same composition produced by one-step extrusion.

Upon storage at common temperatures after preparation solid nanoparticles are formed in tristearin and <b>tripalmitin</b> dispersions. In contrast to literature reports, colloidal dispersions of trilaurin do not form solid particles under those conditions.

We find that the primary decomposition reactions of <b>tripalmitin</b> initiate with the successive scission of the alkyl-oxygen bond to form three straight chain C 16 H 31 O 2 center dot (RCOO center dot) radicals and C 3 H 5 center dot radical.

The commercial immobilized lipase from Rhizomucour miehei, Lipozyme RM IM and the recombinante Ryzopus oryzae lipase (rROL) immobilized on two different supports (Lewatit® VPOC 1600 and Sepabeads) were tested as biocatalysts. After 24 h acidolysis at 60 ºC and using a molar ratio (MR) tripalmitin/FFA of 2 : 1, molar incorporations of 20. 5 %, 19. 8 % and 14. 4 % of FFA in <b>tripalmitin</b> were achieved with immobilized rROL in Lewatit, in Sepabeads or with Lipozyme RMIM, respectively. rROL in Lewatit was selected for subsequent studies, due to its higher mechanical resistance to magnetic stirring. The activity of rROL immobilized on Lewatit increased with its initial water activity (aw). The highest molar incorporation of 20. 5 %, was observed at an aw of 0. 95. Modeling and optimization of reaction conditions (temperature and MR) of acidolysis were performed by response surface methodology (RSM). The highest molar incorporation were obtained at lower temperatures and molar ratios (T= 58 ºC; MR= 2 : 1). The rROL showed to be a feasible biocatalyst to produce HMF...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Crystal Growth and the definitive published version is available at [URL] image processing algorithm previously used to analyse the crystallisation of a pure fat (<b>tripalmitin)</b> {{has been applied to}} the crystallisation of a multicomponent natural fat (palm oil). In contrast to <b>tripalmitin,</b> which produced circular crystals with a constant growth rate, palm oil produced speckled crystals caused by the inclusion of entrapped liquid, and growth rates gradually decreased with time. This {{can be explained by the}} depletion of crystallisable material in the liquid phase, whereas direct impingement of crystals (the basis of the Avrami equation) was less common. A theoretical analysis combining this depletion with assuming that the growth rate is proportional to the supersaturation of a crystallisable pseudo-component predicted a tanh function variation of radius with time. This was generally able to provide good fits to the growth curves. It was found that growth rate was a relatively mild function of temperature but also varied from crystal to crystal and even between different sides of the same crystal, which may be due to variations in composition within the liquid phase. Nucleation rates were confirmed to vary approximately exponentially with decreasing temperature, resulting in much greater numbers of crystals and a smaller final average crystal size at lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} (SLNs) {{loaded with}} ibuprofen (IBU) were prepared by solvent-free high-pressure homogenization (HPH). The produced SLNs consisted of stearic acid, triluarin or <b>tripalmitin</b> as lipid matrixes and various stabilizers. The produced empty and IBU-loaded SLNs were characterized for particle size stability over 8 months. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were implemented {{to characterize the}} IBU state of freeze-dried SLNs. IBU {{was found to be}} in both amorphous and crystalline form within the lipid matrix. The lyophilized powders showed increased dissolution rates for IBU depending on the lipid nature.

In this study, we prepared aqueous dispersions of lipid nanoparticles using a modified, pH-sensitive derivative of phosphatidylethanolamine. Methods: SLNs were prepared using polysorbate 80 as the surfactant and <b>tripalmitin</b> glyceride and N-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine as the lipid components. Particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential were examined by photon correlation spectroscopy. Morphological evaluation was performed using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Results: Photon correlation spectroscopy revealed a particle hydrodynamic diameter of 165. 8 nm and zeta potential of &ndash; 41. 6. 0 mV for the drug-loaded nanoparticles. Atomic force microscopy investigation showed the nanoparticles to be 50 &ndash; 600 nm {{in length and}} 66. 5 nm in height. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated {{that the majority of}} SLNs possessed less ordered arrangements of crystals compared with corresponding bulk lipids, which is favorable for improving drug-loading capacity. Drug-loading capacity and drug entrapment efficiency values for the SLNs were 25. 32 % and 94. 32 %, respectively. Conclusion: The SLNs prepared in this study were able to control the release of triamcinolone acetonide under acidic conditions.
