25|$|A merger {{between this}} company {{with several other}} small match {{companies}} in Sweden, the company AB Svenska Förenade Tändsticksfabriker was founded in 1913 with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager. Later, by merging with the largest match company in Sweden, AB Jönköping-Vulcan, Svenska Tändsticks AB (Swedish Match) was founded in 1917. Ivar had originally tried to convince AB Jönköping-Vulcan to merge in December 1912, but {{they had not been}} interested as Vulcan was the dominating match company in Sweden. Ivar then started to acquire all of the match companies as well as most of the raw material companies he could find in and around Sweden and then finally got AB Jönköping-Vulcan to accept the merger. He had been so persuasive in arguing for the merger that he managed <b>to</b> <b>overvalue</b> his side of the deal so that it was essentially the smaller organization taking over the larger one. It was his first big venture in inflating values, which became his prime tactic thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud {{said that this}} is an {{original}} state from which the individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part of}} normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend <b>to</b> <b>overvalue</b> the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E
2500|$|The problem {{continues}} {{to attract the}} attention of cognitive psychologists. The typical behavior of the majority, i.e., not switching, may be explained by phenomena known in the psychological literature as 1) the endowment effect (Kahneman et al., 1991), in which people tend <b>to</b> <b>overvalue</b> the winning probability of the already chosen – already [...] "owned" [...] – door; 2) the status quo bias (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988), in which people prefer to stick with the choice of door they have already made; and 3) the errors of omission vs. errors of commission effect (Gilovich et al., 1995), in which, ceteris paribus, people prefer any errors for which they are responsible to have occurred through 'omission' of taking action, rather than through having taken an explicit action that later becomes known to have been erroneous. Experimental evidence confirms that these are plausible explanations that do not depend on probability intuition (Kaivanto et al., 2014; Morone and Fiore, 2007).|$|E

First, due to financial market integration {{and the elimination of}} exchange rate risk, intra-Eurozone acquisitions do not earn any abnormal returns for bidders. Second, {{as a result of the}} euro debt crisis and the temporary misvaluation among European countries, acquisitions earn positive abnormal returns only for non-Eurozone companies acquiring Eurozone targets. These abnormal returns are driven by the depreciation of the euro and the use of low-cost capital available <b>to</b> <b>overvalued</b> acquirers...|$|R

And more robust and more dynamic agricultural growth could significantly boost sustainable economic growth and rural development in those countries. An appropriate avenue for improving agricultural growth is to expand agricultural exports in MENA countries with appreciable-to-large agricultural sectors and comparative advantage in cereal grains, agricultural raw materials, fruits and vegetables, and many categories of livestock and dairy products. But high levels of protection in many MENA countries, especially for manufactures and some food products, contribute <b>to</b> <b>overvalued</b> exchange rates and a significant bias against agriculture.

It seems essential to the cause that your Lordship should meet your friends with some settled plan either of action or inaction. Your friends will certainly require such a plan; and I am sure the state of affairs requires it, whether they call for it or not. As to the measure of a secession with reasons, after rolling the matter in my head a good deal, and turning it an hundred ways, I confess I still think it the most advisable, notwithstanding the serious objections that lie against it, and indeed the extreme uncertainty of all political measures, especially at this time. It provides for your honor. I know of nothing else that can so well do this. It is something, perhaps all, that can be done in our present situation. Some precaution, in this respect, is not without its motives. That very estimation for which you have sacrificed everything else is in some danger of suffering in the general wreck; and perhaps it is likely to suffer the more, because you have hitherto confided more than was quite prudent in the clearness of your intentions, and in the solidity of the popular judgment upon them.

However, such as it is, (and for one I do not think I am inclined <b>to</b> <b>overvalue</b> it,) both our interest and our duty make it necessary for us to attend to it very carefully, so long as we act a part in public.

6000|$|Before I proceed further, I have {{to remark}} that Dr. Price seems rather <b>to</b> <b>overvalue</b> the great {{acquisitions}} of light {{which he has}} obtained and diffused in this age. The last century appears to me to have been quite as much enlightened. It had, though in a different place, a triumph as memorable as that of Dr. Price; {{and some of the}} great preachers of that period partook of it as eagerly as he has done in the triumph of France. On the trial of the Reverend Hugh Peters for high treason, it was deposed, that, when King Charles was brought to London for his trial, the Apostle of Liberty in that day conducted the triumph. [...] "I saw," [...] says the witness, [...] "his Majesty in the coach with six horses, and Peters riding before the king triumphing." [...] Dr. Price, when he talks as if he had made a discovery, only follows a precedent; for, after the commencement of the king's trial, this precursor, the same Dr. Peters, concluding a long prayer at the royal chapel at Whitehall, (he had very triumphantly chosen his place,) said, [...] "I have prayed and preached these twenty years; and now I may say with old Simeon, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."[89] Peters had not the fruits of his prayer; for he neither departed so soon as he wished, nor in peace. He became (what I heartily hope none of his followers may be in this country) himself a sacrifice to the triumph which he led as pontiff. They dealt at the Restoration, perhaps, too hardly with this poor good man. But we owe it to his memory and his sufferings, that he had as much illumination and as much zeal, and had as effectually undermined all the superstition and error which might impede the great business he was engaged in, as any who follow and repeat after him in this age, which would assume to itself an exclusive title to the knowledge of the rights of men, and all the glorious consequences of that knowledge.|$|E

40|$|We examine IPO underpricing, valuation, {{and wealth}} {{allocation}} {{in relation to}} investor sentiment, information asymmetry, and underwriter reputation.

We find no evidence of systematic over or undervaluation of IPOs based on peer firm accounting ratios.

Better underwriter reputation leads to higher IPO valuation for all IPOs. Further, roughly 70 % of the wealth from overvaluing IPOs is retained by the issuers.

Specifically, a VC-backed firm is more likely <b>to</b> be <b>overvalued</b> in the bubble period if the lead VC invests more, and/or has a more independent organizational structure, and/or is more experienced.
