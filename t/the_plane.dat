5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Flynn and Troy take the controls of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
5|$|The {{makers of}} the film {{acknowledged}} the responsibility of portraying the story. One challenge faced was acquiring a real plane for shooting; director Ram Madhvani and Rucha Pathak decided to re-create <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> because {{a major part of}} the film required shooting against <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> back-drop. It took them 48 days to build <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> which closely resembled the original one.|$|E
5|$|A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
50|$|The complex metaphysics of the Channelled entity Michael {{includes}} {{a description of}} the universe in terms of seven <b>planes.</b> These are <b>the</b> Physical <b>plane,</b> <b>the</b> Astral <b>plane,</b> <b>the</b> Causal <b>plane,</b> <b>the</b> Akashic <b>plane,</b> <b>the</b> Mental <b>plane,</b> <b>the</b> Messianic <b>plane,</b> and <b>the</b> Buddhaic <b>plane.</b> Here <b>the</b> Causal <b>plane</b> is <b>the</b> third <b>plane</b> of creation, and its medium is concrete intellectual energy.

5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device {{consisting of a}} mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> on fire.|$|E
5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled off <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} and <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E
5|$|An anxious Charlie {{runs to the}} {{bathroom}}, {{where he}} locks himself to snort heroin. After <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> becomes shaky, Charlie is slammed against the bathroom ceiling, and decides to leave. After being nearly hit by a refreshment cart, Charlie rushes to a seat several rows back and straps himself in as <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> shakes.|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} {{conduction}} in a strongly anisotropic metal is considered. It is {{shown that a}} region of temperatures can exist such that in <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> (<b>the</b> easy direction) transport is of the usual Boltzmann type, whereas between <b>planes</b> (<b>the</b> hard direction) transport consists of a sequence of incoherent jumps. In this temperature region the product σ_∥;σ_ is independent of temperature (σ_∥; and σ_ are, respectively, conductivities in <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> and in <b>the</b> direction perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>planes)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Around 17 hours later, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> loses {{auxiliary}} power, and {{the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> in Karachi. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
50|$|The disease {{seems to}} be {{specific}} to <b>the</b> London <b>plane,</b> <b>the</b> Oriental <b>plane</b> and <b>the</b> Occidental <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> disease causes large lesions on the upper sides of branches associated with branch drop.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> control <b>plane</b> {{maintains}} {{information that}} can be used to change data used by <b>the</b> data <b>plane.</b> Maintaining this information requires handling complex signaling protocols. Implementing these protocols in <b>the</b> data <b>plane</b> would lead to poor forwarding performance. A common way to manage these protocols is to let <b>the</b> data <b>plane</b> detect incoming signaling packets and locally forward them to <b>the</b> control <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> control <b>plane</b> signaling protocols can update <b>the</b> data <b>plane</b> information and inject outgoing signaling packets into <b>the</b> data <b>plane.</b> This architecture works because signaling traffic is a very small part of the global traffic.|$|R
50|$|A {{longitudinal}} plane is any <b>plane</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> transverse <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> coronal <b>plane</b> and <b>the</b> sagittal <b>plane</b> {{are examples of}} {{longitudinal plane}}s.|$|R

5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> using only squares of a single size.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{served as}} a DH-4 bomber pilot with the United States Army Air Service during World War I.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Outer <b>Planes</b> were {{presented}} {{for the first}} time in Volume 1, Number 8 of The Dragon, released July 1977. In the article [...] "Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&D", Gary Gygax mentions that there are 16 Outer <b>Planes</b> and describes <b>the</b> Seven Heavens, the Twin Paradises, and Elysium as [...] "Typical higher planes", Nirvana as the [...] "plane of ultimate Law" [...] and Limbo as the [...] "plane of ultimate Chaos (entropy)", and the Nine Hells, Hades' three glooms, and the 666 layers of the Abyss as [...] "Typical lower planes". Other Outer Planes mentioned by name in the article include the Happy Hunting Grounds, Olympus, Gladsheim, Pandemonium, Tarterus, Gehenna, Acheron, and Arcadia. <b>The</b> Outer <b>Planes</b> {{were presented}} again in an appendix of <b>the</b> known <b>planes</b> of existence in the original (1st edition) AD&D Players Handbook, published in June 1978. This appendix included an abstract diagram of <b>the</b> <b>planes,</b> and mentioned <b>the</b> same 16 Outer Planes: The Seven Heavens of absolute lawful good, the Twin Paradises of neutral good lawfuls, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of Elysium of neutral good, the Happy Hunting Grounds of neutral good chaotics, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of Olympus of absolute good chaotics, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of Gladsheim (Asgard, Valhalla, Vanaheim, etc.) of chaotic good neutrals, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of Limbo of neutral (absolute) chaos (entropy), <b>the</b> <b>Planes</b> of Pandemonium of chaotic evil neutrals, the 666 layers of the Abyss of absolute chaotic evil, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of Tarterus of evil chaotic neutrals, Hades' [...] "Three Glooms" [...] of absolute (neutral) evil, the furnaces of Gehenna of lawful evil neutrals, the Nine Hells of absolute lawful evil, <b>the</b> nether <b>planes</b> of Acheron of lawful evil neutrals, Nirvana of absolute (neutral) lawfuls, and <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of Arcadia of neutral good lawfuls.|$|R
5000|$|This {{correlation}} in {{the case}} of [...] can be described geometrically using the model of <b>the</b> real projective <b>plane</b> which is a [...] "unit sphere with antipodes identified", or equivalently, the model of lines and <b>planes</b> through <b>the</b> origin of the vector space [...] Associate to any line through the origin <b>the</b> unique <b>plane</b> through <b>the</b> origin which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the line. When, in the model, these lines are considered to be the points and <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>the</b> lines of <b>the</b> projective <b>plane</b> , this association becomes a correlation (actually a polarity) of <b>the</b> projective <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> sphere model is obtained by intersecting <b>the</b> lines and <b>planes</b> through <b>the</b> origin with a unit sphere centered at the origin. The lines meet the sphere in antipodal points which must then be identified to obtain a point of <b>the</b> projective <b>plane,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> meet <b>the</b> sphere in great circles which are thus the lines of <b>the</b> projective <b>plane.</b>|$|R
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a remote area so authorities could re-screen <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> the passengers, and the baggage on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees.
