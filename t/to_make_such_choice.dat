Our experience demonstrates that there was a high mortality rate (57 %) in neuromuscular patients supported by mechanical ventilation before the age of 2 years. (J Child Neurol 1987; 2 : 30 - 32). Because of recent advances in technology,patients with neuromuscular disease fre-quently choose mechanical ventilation to prolong survival and improve quality of life. 1, 2 Portable ven-tilators allow patients to leave the hospital and to conduct productive lifestyles.

40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of point-to-point routing protocols {{is limited by}} a trade-off between routing state and routing stretch. A wireless sensor network (WSN) designer can choose from a whole spectrum of routing techniques that exploit this trade-off at varying granularity. We aim <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>choices</b> more informed; our contributions are twofold. First, we present the first point-to-point routing framework for WSNs that provides uniform implementations of four routing techniques that, from the state-stretch trade-off perspective, represent the entire spec-trum. Second, using the framework we conduct an unprecedented experimental comparison of the techniques in TOSSIM and on two testbeds. In particular, we show that most techniques with sub-linear state offer a small stretch in WSNs. These results can guide the initial choice of potential routing techniques for a given WSN; the framework can facilitate {{the choice of a}} particular technique by enabling experiments in one’s own settings.

However, social psychology and behavioural research {{suggest that there}} is a wide variety of approaches that individuals use <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>choices.</b> We explore this heterogeneity against the backdrop of so-called 'dual process models', analysing participants' responses in a survey of public beliefs about and preferences for climate change adaptation policies. We find that the postulate of two different types of decision-making, the systematic-analytical and the heuristic-holistic, does indeed help us to understand patterns in respondent behaviour that are, in turn, underpinned by respondents' motivation and ability to process information. Participants who were motivated and able to process the information provided were more likely to express preferences in line with their beliefs about adaptation policies, whereas those less motivated and more confused were more likely to use generalised rules-of-thumb that were not specific to the policy issue at hand. Depending on the theoretical framework of a study, such heterogeneity in response consistency and use of generic rules-of-thumb might have implications for the usefulness of survey outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings, and draw conclusions for survey-based environmental research.

30|$|Researchers often {{cite the}} metaphor {{in this example}} as a lens through which to {{investigate}} Mao’s thoughts about Chinese and Western cultures. Interestingly, advanced Western culture was analogous to raw material instead of edible food, suggesting that the culture abroad had to be transformed first, just as raw material must be cooked to be real food. This metaphor constructed pragmatism such that Western culture was classified into two parts, and only the part coherent with Chinese socialism culture was chosen. For instance, Western culture, which is “progressive” and “useful,” is defined and includes the cultures of the various capitalist countries in the Age of Enlightenment. Moreover, in the metaphor, the digestive process is divided into several steps. First, the process of accepting and taking in Western culture is compared with the activity of chewing in the mouth and swallowing food into stomach. Then, during the digestive process, the saliva and gastric juices break down the food into either nutriments or waste. The waste is then excreted and discarded, and the nutriments are absorbed. In fact, {{this is not a}} natural process of our body’s functions since it overstates the control our body has by emphasizing the classification, selection, and treatment of food inside the body, when the only chance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>choices</b> is when food stays in our mouths.|$|R

Three questionnaires posed one of the familiar screening scenarios without cost-effectiveness information, three posed one of the familiar scenarios with cost-effectiveness information, and three posed one of the unfamiliar scenarios with cost-effectiveness information. The cost-effectiveness information for familiar scenarios was drawn from the medical literature. The cost-effectiveness information for unfamiliar scenarios was fabricated to match that of a corresponding familiar scenario. In all questionnaires, physicians were asked what screening alternative they would recommend. A total of 560 physicians responded (65 %). For familiar scenarios, providing cost-effectiveness information had at most a small influence on physicians' screening recommendations; it reduced the proportion of physicians recommending annual Pap smears (p= 0. 003), but did not significantly alter the aggressiveness of colon cancer and breast cancer screening (both p'sDecision making Physician survey Cost-effectiveness USA...|$|R

40|$|School leaders play {{a central}} role in {{affecting}} the educational development of the young people for whom they have responsibility. This is especially the case where school leaders are operating in challenging low-income environments. This paper argues that a focus on Sen’s notions of individual agency and freedom are a necessary but not a sufficient factor in the conversion of capabilities into functionings for these school leaders. This is done through using the Capabilities Approach as a lens through which to carry out a retrospective analysis and evaluation of the activities of a group of primary school headteachers in Ghana involved in a UK Government-funded project focused on education quality. The paper argues that headteachers with the capability of initiating change in the education process in their schools are unlikely to act in this way unless they feel that they have permission to do so. It is also important that headteachers feel that they are working within a context and an environment where acting in ways which aim to improve pupil learning is seen as central to their role. This kind of supportive context for school leaders (and for other educational practitioners) cannot be divorced from a policy environment which sanctions such activities, and, hence, it is argued that such a context is crucial to policy developments which seek to establish and sustain the core capabilities which are at the heart of Nussbaum’s essentialist approach. The paper also brings to the foreground the tensions that exist between the notion of individuals being free <b>to</b> <b>make</b> choices about what they have reason to value, on the one hand, and the implications that these choices have for the freedoms of other individuals with whom they are connected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>choices.</b> Finally, it is argued in the paper that the action research approach used in the Leadership & Management Project in Ghana, allied to a positive policy context, provides both the sensitivity to context and a practice-oriented focus which can enable school leaders to bring about the conversion of their individual capabilities into functionings...|$|R

2500|$|Two famous {{statements}} in set theory are the {{axiom of choice}} and the continuum hypothesis. The axiom of choice, first stated by Zermelo (1904), was proved independent of ZF by Fraenkel (1922), but {{has come to be}} widely accepted by mathematicians. [...] It states that given a collection of nonempty sets there is a single set C that contains exactly one element from each set in the collection. The set C is said to [...] "choose" [...] one element from each set in the collection. While the ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> a <b>choice</b> is considered obvious by some, since each set in the collection is nonempty, the lack of a general, concrete rule by which the choice can be made renders the axiom nonconstructive. Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski (1924) showed that the axiom of choice can be used to decompose a solid ball into a finite number of pieces which can then be rearranged, with no scaling, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> two solid balls of the original size.

Social insects are thought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> optimal <b>choices</b> by collecting individuals' responses relating to an option's value (= a quality-graded response). However, this behaviour cannot explain the collective rationality of brains because neurons can make only 'yes/no' responses {{on the basis of}} the response threshold. Here, we elucidate the basic mechanism underlying the collective rationality of such simple units and show that an ant species uses this mechanism. A larger number of units respond 'yes' to the best option available to a collective decision-maker using only the yes/no mechanism; thus, the best option is always selected by majority decision. Colonies of the ant Myrmica kotokui preferred the better option in a binary choice experiment. The preference of a colony was demonstrated by the workers, which exhibited variable thresholds between two options' qualities.

When a domain is rife with conflicts of interest—as in the allocation context—soft-touch strategies fare poorly. Since our tax-incentivized retirement system has paternalistic roots, we should more readily consider direct regulation of investment options available to retirement accounts. The migration of American retirement savings from centralized, riskpooling structures (Social Security and pensions) toward individual retirement plans (401 (k) plans and other tax-favored, individually managed accounts) had collateral consequences. In particular, the responsibility for making complicated financial choices was redistributed to the individual saver—who typically lacks the knowledge and sophistication <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>choices.</b> The result has been that many savers make costly mistakes in investing their portfolios. In response, academics and policymakers, most formally through the Pension Protection Act of 2006, have turned to a variety of typical “soft” remedies, including nudges designed to improve investment decisions by allowing employers to automatically direct employee savings into certain default mutual funds. This Article argues that nudges have failed and will continue to fail in improving the allocation of retirement portfolios, because of problems that are common in many nudge programs. First, nudges rarely consider the ability of third parties to counter-nudge or to weaken nudge outcomes. Conflicts of interest are pervasive in the mutual fund and retirement industry, and those who accept the nudges are being pushed into a category of funds of dubious merit, and which appear to be worsening as institutions seek to exploit the default. Second, nudges are often loosely connected, or not connected at all, to the cognitive problems they seek to remedy. In the retirement allocation context, the nudge acts as a weak mandate for a substantive preference, rather than as a corrective for investors’ cognitive biases. Finally, nudging often asserts autonomy—taking an agent’s preferences seriously—as its central goal. But the claim that the retirement allocation nudges respect savers’ preferences is problematic as a descriptive matter, and illogical as a normative matter, in a domain that is already a government-sponsored, tax-advantaged, paternalistic means to encourage retirement savings...|$|R
