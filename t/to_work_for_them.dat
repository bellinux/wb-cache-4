Despite the story's controversial message, the critical success of Bob & Rose encouraged the channel to commission the series for broadcast.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ben Tillman, his mother, and his wounded brother James (who died in 1866) {{worked to}} rebuild Chester plantation. They signed the plantation's freedmen as workers. They were {{confronted with the}} {{circumstance}} of several men refusing <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> and legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several workers from the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton-planting belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida—after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.|$|E

5|$|The Vidiians' culture also shifts as {{a result}} of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an {{individual}} would hire a specialist, or a honatta, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or group meetings are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians out of fear of contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> as slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following Voyager encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.|$|E
5|$|To {{instruct}} new Pakistani {{students in}} the methods of archaeology, in early 1950 Wheeler ran a training excavation at Mohenjo-daro; there, he was joined by the British student Leslie Alcock, who spoke both Punjabi and Urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by Wheeler. This excavation {{proved to be the}} only one for which Wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report. Instead, he made reference to its findings in his book The Indus Civilization, published as part of the series The Cambridge History of India. His relationship with the Pakistani government had become strained, and so he declined to return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> for a third year.|$|E

After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on {{the corner of}} cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve {{at the foot of}} Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E

25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E

The officers said if Fenton agreed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> as an informer {{he would not be}} prosecuted, and he would be paid in addition.

25|$|Construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal {{began in}} 1766, and when its {{engineer}} James Brindley died in 1772, Henshall {{was given the}} post. Clowes worked as a contractor, as he advertised for labourers in 1775 {{to work on the}} project, and was probably involved in the construction of locks and of Harecastle Tunnel. He did not immediately take up engineering, even though the Chester Canal had asked him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> in 1776, but instead became a partner with Henshall in a canal carrying business, running boats on the Trent and Mersey Canal. The date of his second marriage to Margaret is not known, but is thought to be around this time.|$|E
25|$|When Roosevelt {{was wounded}} by an assassin, Wilson {{restricted}} his events to those already scheduled and limited his criticism {{to the regular}} Republicans. It was evident by this time that the Wilson movement would not be checked. The GOP split between Taft and Roosevelt enlarged Wilson's success in the electoral college. Wilson appealed to African Americans and promised <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> gaining some support among them in the North {{at the expense of}} the Republicans. But throughout the South, most African Americans had been disenfranchised by actions of state legislatures from 1890 to 1908, and were largely excluded from the political system. Wilson took 41.8% of the popular vote and won 435 electoral votes from 40 states. It is not clear if Roosevelt took more votes from fellow Republican Taft, or fellow progressive Wilson.|$|E

She also used the crystal to send the fallen into the future to be reborn on Earth, hoping to give them a second chance at peace.|$|E
