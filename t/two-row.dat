40|$|Under the {{irregular}} weather that characterises Mediterranean environments, to increase yield stability in cereal crops represents an important objective for agricultural progress. In this study, {{a series of}} ®eld experiments were conducted with twoand six-rowed barley cultivars under Mediterranean conditions (southern Spain) to determine their differences in yield stability and to identify the in¯uence that initiation and mortality of both the spikelet and tiller could exert on yield differences. Yield stability differed markedly in two- and six-rowed cultivars. The yield of <b>two-rowed</b> cultivars was more responsive to environmental changes {{than that of the}} six-rowed cultivars, which consistently showed more stable behaviour, outyielding the <b>two-rowed</b> barleys in the lowest yielding environments. <b>Two-rowed</b> cultivars had far more spikes per m 2 than did six-rowed cultivars, while the latter consistently had more grains per spike, with a lower average grain weight. Yield differences among environments, for both groups of cultivars, were more associated with changes in number of grains per unit of land area than to differences in individual grain weight. Six-rowed cultivars, as expected, produced virtually threefold more spikelets per spike than the <b>two-rowed</b> cultivars. Although there was a large difference between two- and six-rowed cultivars in spikelet abortion, the proportion of abortion was fairly stable across environments. <b>Two-rowed</b> cultivars consistently tillered at a higher rate (0. 11 tillers per day) than the six-rowed barleys (0. 07 tillers per day), though the magnitude of the difference in tillering was mor...|$|R

40|$|Mode of {{inheritance}} {{and genetic}} variance components for spike length, grain number per spike and grain weight per spike were evaluated in four parental genotypes and their F 1 and F 2 hybrids obtained through incomplete diallel crossing.

The six-rowed x six-rowed and <b>two-rowed</b> x <b>two-rowed</b> crossing combinations showed dominance of increased grain number per spike and increased grain weight per spike in the inheritance of grain number per spike and grain weight per spike, respectively, whereas the six-rowed x <b>two-rowed</b> cross was predominated by partial dominance.

DH lines were derived from the cross between <b>two-rowed</b> cultivar Maresi and six-rowed cultivar Pomo by the Hordeum bulbosum technique. The initial cultivars, their F 1, F 2 hybrids and DH lines (20 <b>two-rowed</b> and 18 six-rowed) were investigated in the field conditions conducted in the completely randomised block design with three replications. The following characters of the stem were analysed: length, external diameter, wall thickness and elasticity (YoungÃ¢Â€Â™s modulus). Lodging grade was estimated applying a 9 -grade scale (where 1 means no lodging and 9 -the highest degree of lodging). The stem elasticity was evaluated by the ultrasonic method. Analysis of variance was performed and contrasts between six-rowed and <b>two-rowed</b> genotypes were calculated. Genetic parameters related to with additive gene action [d], dominance [h] and nonallelic interaction of homozygous [i] and heterozygous [l] loci were estimated. The values of the [d] parameter were significant for all the studied traits. The effects of dominance were important only for the stem length and lodging grade.

25|$|Spikelets are {{arranged}} in triplets which alternate along the rachis. In wild barley (and other Old World species of Hordeum), only the central spikelet is fertile, while {{the other two are}} reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as <b>two-row</b> barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile lateral spikelets to produce six-row barleys. Recent genetic studies have revealed that a mutation in one gene, vrs1, is responsible for the transition from <b>two-row</b> to six-row barley.|$|E

The downside was a relatively large frontal area that had to be left open to provide enough airflow, which increased drag.

40|$|Grain yield {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and complex traits in cereal breeding and depends upon a combination of different plant traits. Therefore, an effective breeding program requires a proper understanding of the relationships between grain yield and agronomic traits. The objectives of this study were the evaluation of <b>two-rowed</b> winter malting barley genotypes and the perceiving of relationships among grain yield and their agronomic and quality traits. The trials with 19 <b>two-rowed</b> winter malting barley genotypes were conducted during three years.

40|$|Increased seed {{production}} {{has been a}} common goal during the domestication of cereal crops, and early cultivators of barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) selected a phenotype with a six-rowed spike that stably produced three times the usual grain number. This improved yield established barley as a founder crop for the Near Eastern Neolithic civilization. The barley spike has one central and two lateral spikelets at each rachis node. The wild-type progenitor (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) has a <b>two-rowed</b> phenotype, with additional, strictly rudimentary, lateral rows; this natural adaptation is advantageous for seed dispersal after shattering. Until recently, {{the origin of the}} six-rowed phenotype remained unknown. In the present study, we isolated vrs 1 (six-rowed spike 1), the gene responsible for the six-rowed spike in barley, by means of positional cloning. The wild-type Vrs 1 allele (for <b>two-rowed</b> barley) encodes a transcription factor that includes a homeodomain with a closely linked leucine zipper motif. Expression of Vrs 1 was strictly localized in the lateral-spikelet primordia of immature spikes, suggesting that the VRS 1 protein suppresses development of the lateral rows. Loss of function of Vrs 1 resulted in complete conversion of the rudimentary lateral spikelets in <b>two-rowed</b> barley into fully developed fertile spikelets in the six-rowed phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the six-rowed phenotype originated repeatedly, at different times and in different regions, through independent mutations of Vrs 1...|$|R
