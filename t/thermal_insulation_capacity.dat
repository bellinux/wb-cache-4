40|$|Since ancient times, the {{enhancement}} of properties of fired clay products was solved by adding different materials to the clay mixtures. The role of added materials, such as sand or vegetal materials (mainly straw) was to reduce the plasticity of mixtures — slenderizing — for shaping. But the non-plastic components introduced also inhibited the shrinkage of products, by two mechanisms. Frequently, excessive plasticity of raw clays was treated {{by the addition of}} vegetal materials, usually straw. The same technique was applied when an increase in the dry mechanical resistance was desired. By the increasing energy demand of heating of buildings for human living, the attention of brick producers was directed towards the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> of building materials. In the case of traditional clay brick, the solution for increasing the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> is the artificial increase of porosity. Beyond the primary porosity of fired clay material, caused by the decomposition of carbonates, contraction of clay minerals and organic matter combustion, the introduction of pore-forming additives contributes to the increase of porosity of bricks...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find a feasible way to reuse mud cuttings from ornamental stone, such as trachyte and basalt, normally disposed of in landfills, using it in the production of full and/or aerated bricks for civil purposes. The study examined the characteristics of full bricks produced with mud cuttings from ornamental stone including, resistance to uniaxial compression, water absorption and apparent density of mud alone or when mixed with two types of clay at different firing temperatures. As temperature rose, the strength and density of the samples increased, while absorption decreased. The use of clay improved the sintering process during firing, giving a less porous and mechanically stronger material that normally used to produce full bricks for civil constructions. For the second type of product, aerated bricks, the study investigated porosity, density, resistance to uniaxial compression and the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> of bricks made by adding lime and aluminium powder to trachyte mud at different sintering temperatures, ranging between 980 and 1040 °C. As temperature increased, it was observed that an increase in the resistance and density of the samples was accompanied by a reduction in the heat-insulating capacity. When compared with commercial aerated bricks, it was found that aerated bricks obtained from trachyte sludge cuttings and fired at temperatures below 1030 °C, have a greater <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> but a lower mechanical resistance, restricting their use to non-load-bearing masonry applications...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In a cold, wet, or windy environment, cold {{exposure}} can {{be considerable}} for an injured or ill person. The subsequent autonomous stress response initially will increase circulatory and respiratory demands, and as {{body core temperature}} declines, the patient's condition might deteriorate. Therefore, the application of adequate insulation to reduce cold exposure and prevent body core cooling {{is an important part}} of prehospital primary care, but recommendations for what should be used in the field mostly depend on tradition and experience, not on scientific evidence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> properties in different wind conditions of 12 different blankets and rescue bags commonly used by prehospital rescue and ambulance services. METHODS: The thermal manikin and the selected insulation ensembles were setup inside a climatic chamber in accordance to the modified European Standard for assessing requirements of sleeping bags. Fans were adjusted to provide low (< 0. 5 m/s), moderate (2 - 3 m/s) and high (8 - 9 m/s) wind conditions. During steady state thermal transfer, the total resultant insulation value, Itr (m 2 C/Wclo; where C = degrees Celcius, and W = watts), was calculated from ambient air temperature (C), manikin surface temperature (C), and heat flux (W/m 2). RESULTS: In the low wind condition, <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> of the evaluated ensembles correlated to thickness of the ensembles, ranging from 2. 0 to 6. 0 clo (1 clo = 0. 155 m 2 C/W), except for the reflective metallic foil blankets that had higher values than expected. In moderate and high wind conditions, <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> was best preserved for ensembles that were windproof and resistant to the compressive effect of the wind, with insulation reductions down to about 60 - 80 % of the original <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity,</b> whereas wind permeable and/or lighter materials were reduced down to about 30 - 50 % of original <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated insulation ensembles might all be used for prehospital protection against cold, either as single blankets or in multiple layer combinations, depending on ambient temperatures. However, with extended outdoor, on-scene durations, such as during prolonged extrications or in multiple casualty situations, the results of this study emphasize the importance of using a windproof and compression resistant outer ensemble to maintain adequate <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The thermal {{conductivity}} of three mixtures of nitrogen and cyclopentane is measured using a transient hot wire method, at temperatures between 315. 14 and 395. 89 K, and pressures up to 0. 53 MPa. These mixtures {{are important in}} the evaluation of the evolution of the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> of closed-cell polyurethane foams considering their aging during the respective applications ’ total life time. The experimental {{thermal conductivity}} data are correlated with the Wassiljewa mixing rules as modified by Mason and Saxena, and predicted using extended corresponding states theory (ECST), with an average absolute deviation of 1. 1 and 8. 9 %, respectively. The increase of the nitrogen fraction in cyclopentane–nitrogen mixtures leads to higher thermal conductivity values than has been predicted by ECST using only pure component thermal conductivity data for all measurements.

This experiment confirms that lower overall temperatures are found {{on the surface of the}} comfort layer of the specimen with SAF than on the specimen without SAF, even when the thicknesses of the thermal liner layers are similar. The maximum temperature difference was about 20 °C. The thermal protective performance of FPC with SAF increased with increasing SAF thickness, but the increase became very minor when the SAF thickness exceeded 6 mm. Additionally, the thermal stability of silica aerogel is significantly better than that of commercial thermal liner material, reducing the risk of thermal decomposition at high temperatures.

This situation is obvious in case of old, historical building, subjected to this aggression {{for a long period}} of time, but new buildings are also affected. Moisture in building materials causes not only structural damage, but also reduces the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> of building components. Materials like plasters or paints have been used historically {{for a long period of}} time, fulfilling two basics functions: Decoration and Protection. The most acute demands are made on exterior plasters, as they, besides being an important decorative element for the facade, must perform two different functions simultaneously: protect the substrate against weathering and moisture without sealing, providing it a certain ability to “breathe” (Heilen, 2005). In order to accomplish this aim, the first step is to understand the hygrothermal behavior of coating and substrate and define the fundamental principles of moisture transfer; According to Künzel’s Facade Protection Theory, two material properties play the most important role: Water absorption and Vapor permeability.

30|$|Due to many {{well-known}} advantageous aspects, {{researchers have}} investigated the possibility of light weight concrete (LWC) {{as a replacement for}} normal weight concrete (NWC) for structural components. A comparative study on the fracture properties of high-strength concrete with normal aggregate and lightweight aggregate was conducted (Tang et al. 2008). Through the study, the critical stress intensity factor and critical crack tip opening displacement for the double-parameters model and the fracture energy for a fictitious crack model were examined. Since LWC possesses <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity,</b> it can enhance energy consumption efficiency for commercial and residential heating and cooling systems (Chandra and Berntsson 2003; Kayali 2008). For example, using LWC as a structural material may reduce the overall energy consumption of buildings (Yang 2010). Consequently, LWC has been gathering attention as a potential construction material to minimize long-term carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. On one hand, LWC has shown disadvantages in structural performance due to its relatively low Young’s modulus and tensile resistance capacity causing larger deformations and crack width in concrete. By the way, prestressing is highly effective in minimizing cracks and controlling deflections of concrete flexural members (Collins and Mitchell 1991). Introducing a prestressing force to the LWC flexural members can compensate for the reduced serviceability of the members, producing considerable synergistic advantages in structural and environmental aspects. Therefore, a prestressed concrete system with LWC is recognized as a decent solution for creating a suitable structure that can decrease the consumption of the natural resources and reduction in the enormous amount of CO 2 emitted from construction and residual environments (Chandra and Berntsson 2003; Oh and Choi 2004).|$|E

Recently, different types of sandwich components using composite materials have been developed with the purpose of combining the effect of reinforced face-sheets with low weight core materials, such as honeycombs and foams. However, these materials must combine damage tolerance characteristics with high resistance under both static and dynamic loads. Cork composites can be considered as an alternative material for sandwich components since cork is a natural material with some remarkable properties, such as high damage tolerance to impact loads, good <b>thermal</b> and acoustic <b>insulation</b> <b>capacities</b> and excellent damping characteristics for the suppression of vibrations. The experiments carried out in this investigation were oriented in order to optimize the specific strength of cork based composites for sandwich components. Static bending tests were performed in order to characterize the mechanical strength of different types of cork agglomerates which were obtained considering distinct production variables. The ability to withstand dynamic loads was also evaluated from a set of impact tests using carbon-cork sandwich specimens. The results from experimental tests showed that cork agglomerates performance depends on the cork granulate size, the type of reinforcing elements and the bonding procedure used for the cohesion with the matrix material...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> {{of external}} walls is of significant {{importance in the}} context of energy efficient building. This involves not only the thermalinsulation of large-sized building components like wall and ceiling surfaces but also the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> of window reveals. Especially here, however, adequate space for an internal <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> of usual thickness is frequently not available due to the geometrical dependencies. Computational investigations show the dependencies of the window installation position and the thickness of the internal <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> in the reveal on the transmission heat loss and on the surface temperature of the internal corner. Consequently, recommendations are made with regard to a secured hygrothermal implementation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> of the reveals...|$|R
