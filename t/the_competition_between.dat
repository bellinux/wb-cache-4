5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> {{orientation}} {{produced by}} surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider {{the case in}} which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel {{to the surface and}} an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

In autumn 1995 Westwood had released Command & Conquer, and <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> these two games popularized the RTS genre and defined the genre. Blizzard's new game's enhancements included: naval and air units, supported by new buildings and a new resource, oil; higher-resolution artwork rendered in SVGA graphics; improved sound, including additional responses from units; a much better AI; and new mechanisms such as patroling (moving continuously along a route for surveillance or defense). A further generation of the Warcraft: Orcs & Humans lineage, called , was released in July 2002, and gained instant and enduring acclaim with both critics and players.|$|E

5|$|The year 969 was {{a crucial}} one in Syrian history, as it marked {{the climax of the}} Byzantine advance. In October, the generals Michael Bourtzes and Peter {{captured}} Antioch, securing their control over the north Syrian littoral. Soon after, the Byzantines marched against Aleppo itself and forced Qarquya to sign a treaty (December 969 or January 970) making Aleppo a tributary Byzantine protectorate with Qarquya as emir and his deputy, Bakjur, as his designated successor. At the same time, in Egypt, the Fatimids defeated the Ikhshidids and gained control of the country, from where they advanced into southern Syria. <b>The</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> these two powers, Byzantium and the Fatimids, would shape the history of Syria and of Aleppo for the next fifty years.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) fought Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) in an Elimination Last Team Standing {{match in}} the next encounter. Though the match was billed as a Last Team Standing match, it was held under Texas Death match rules. A Texas Death match {{is similar to a}} Last Team Standing match, however, the {{competitor}} must pin or make his opponent submit before the referee begins his count. Daniels pinned Storm following hitting him in the knee with a steel chair to begin the ten count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach the ten count after being pinned following a top rope legdrop by Harris. With the outcome of the match down to <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair. Harris then pinned Skipper to begin the ten count; Skipper did not get to his feet, giving the win to AMW.|$|E

Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro.|$|E
5|$|The vicegerency {{brought the}} pace of reforms {{under the control of}} the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at {{defining}} the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. <b>The</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} against Russia, a {{commission}} {{was assigned to}} identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, {{it came to the}} conclusion that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded and that a strong coastal navy should be built. The artillery officer Augustin Ehrensvärd was the driving force behind these changes and many of the conclusions and decisions of the committee were based on his ideas for improvements. In 1756, a dedicated archipelago fleet was founded and put under the command of Krigskollegium, the army department, with Ehrensvärd as highest commander and the official name arméns flotta ("the fleet of the army"). Over two decades the archipelago fleet went through several changes caused by <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political fractions at the time, and because of rivalries between army and navy. With the parliamentary victory of the Hats in the riksdag of 1769–70 and the coup d'état by Gustav III in 1772, the archipelago fleet's status as an independent organization within the army was secured. From 1770, it was given the Finnish squadron (Finska eskadern) based in Sveaborg and in 1777 the galley fleet based in Stockholm was included in the archipelago fleet as the Swedish squadron (Svenska eskadern). The Swedish military invested considerable resources into the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. The archipelago fleet attracted the social and cultural elite that enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III who had strengthened his authority as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup.|$|E
