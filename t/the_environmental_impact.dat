40|$|Part 2 : Assessment ApproachesInternational audienceLife cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{can help}} enterprises evaluate their productâ€™s <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> through <b>the</b> entire {{product life cycle}} (PLC). On {{the basis of the}} evaluation result, phases which need to take activities to reduce <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> can be found out. However, the activities taken in a phase may influence <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> in other phases, so the effect of the activities should be re-evaluated. Under the pressure from the market, enterprises need to assess the effect of these activities quickly. Nevertheless, re-evaluate by using conventional LCA is a time-consuming work. This paper proposes a novel approach to re-evaluate <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of product based on LCA and Pareto rule which can reduce the time of assessment.

5|$|In 1995, a U.S. Border Patrol {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address {{the high rate of}} accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> report as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys.

5|$|Lillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{rejected}} the location because of <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> These institutions instead {{proposed that the}} track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking {{at the possibility of}} constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of a Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution.

Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. <b>The</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
