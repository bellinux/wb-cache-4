The cast and crew were well received by the locals, as was the director who, along with the cast, was invited by Arvind Singh Mewar, the Maharaja of Udaipur, to attend his lavish Diwali celebrations and firework display, as well as attend a royal wedding held at the Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur. Chris Gill was the editor of the picture.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre {{typically}} focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> a player's sense of rhythm. The genre {{includes}} dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> the co-authorship idea is {{that the}} basic theory of co-authorship was originally hypothesised in the 18th and 19th centuries due to a distaste for the treatment of Joan. Critics were uncomfortable attributing such a harsh depiction to Shakespeare, so they embraced the co-authorship theory to 'clear his name', suggesting that he could not have been responsible for the merciless characterization.|$|E

25|$|Before the Supreme Court, Reynolds {{argued that}} his {{conviction}} for bigamy should be overturned on four issues: {{that it was}} his religious duty to marry multiple times and the First Amendment protected his practice of his religion; that his grand jury had not been legally constituted; <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> of certain jurors were improperly overruled; that testimony was not admissible as it was under another indictment.|$|E
25|$|Savage {{observed}} that industrial unionists criticized craft unionism {{not only for}} the ineffectiveness in dealing with a single employer, but also against larger corporate conglomerates. A union <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> such a combination is most effective if its own structure reflects that of the company. Industrial unions likewise do not normally assess prohibitive dues rates common with craft unions, which serve to keep out many workers. Thus, the entire group of workers finds solidarity more elusive.|$|E
25|$|In several papers, Alan Scott Rau of the University of Texas {{law school}} {{has gone to}} a greater extent than Fortas did in {{grounding}} Prima Paint and the separability doctrine. He notes <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> to the arbitration clause are often inseparable from the underlying claim, and that some public policy objectives may be better served by allowing the case to be heard by an arbitrator first. Conversely, he also notes that some challenges to a contract's formation necessarily include a challenge to the arbitration clause in any event, contrary to some recent lower-court decisions.|$|E

25|$|A puzzle is {{a problem}} or enigma <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> ingenuity. Solutions to puzzle may require {{recognizing}} patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based {{on the process of}} inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good deduction skills. A popular puzzle toy is the Rubik's Cube, invented by Hungarian Ern≈ë Rubik in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{has been}} found <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> the {{accepted}} date of the Dyke's construction. In December 1999, Shropshire County Council archaeologists uncovered {{the remains of a}} hearth or fire on the original ground surface beneath Wat's Dyke near Oswestry, England. Carbon dating analysis of the burnt charcoal and burnt clay in situ showed it was covered by earth on or around AD 446. Archaeologists concluded that this part of Wat's Dyke, so long thought of as Anglo-Saxon and a mid-8th-century contemporary of Offa's Dyke, must have been built 300 years earlier in the post-Roman period.|$|E
25|$|Another work {{in which}} Davis depicts {{the power of}} a female figure is Life in the Iron Mills. The Korl Woman, sculpted by Hugh Wolfe, {{represents}} an all-encompassing sublime image of laboring class womanhood. The intensity with which this figure is received, and the humanistic quality of its structure relay a message intended to reveal the true image of not only laborers, but female beauty as well. The Korl woman serves as a symbol <b>that</b> <b>challenges</b> nineteenth-century standards of femininity. Thus, Davis utilizes the Korl Woman to depict the realistic effects of the iron mills, while simultaneously questioning female societal restrictions as a whole.|$|E
