500|$|Walker {{also sought}} to improve the state of student life and alumni {{relations}} by supporting {{the creation of a}} gymnasium, dormitories, and the <b>Technology</b> <b>Club,</b> which served to foster a stronger identity and loyalty among the largely commuter student body. He also won considerable praise from the student body by reducing the required time spent for recitation and preparation, limiting the faculty to examinations lasting no longer than three hours, expanding entrance examinations to other cities, starting a summer curriculum, and launching masters and doctoral graduate degree programs. These reforms were largely a response to Walker's on-going defense of the Institute and its curriculum from outside accusations of overwork, poor writing, inapplicable skills, and status as a [...] "mere" [...] trade school. Between 1881 and 1897, enrollments quadrupled from 302 to 1,198 students, annual degrees granted increased from 28 to 179, faculty appointments quadrupled from 38 to 156, and the endowment grew thirteenfold from $137,000 to $1,798,000 ($ to $ in 2016 dollars).|$|E

The empirical analysis indicates the existence of three <b>technology</b> <b>clubs</b> with markedly different levels of technological development: advanced, followers and marginalized countries. The <b>technology</b> <b>clubs</b> also differ {{with respect to their}} dynamics over the 1990 s. While the club of followers is characterized by a process of gradual convergence towards the technological frontier, the group of marginalized has experienced an increase in its gap in terms of innovative capabilities.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} forces driving output {{change in a}} panel of EU {{manufacturing}} industries. A flexible modeling strategy is adopted that accounts for (i) inefficient use of resources, and (ii) differences in the production technology across industries. With our model {{we are able to}} identify technical, efficiency, and input growth for endogenously determined <b>technology</b> <b>clubs.</b> Both the <b>technology</b> <b>clubs</b> and the parameters within each club are modeled as a function of R&D intensity. This framework allows us to explore the components of output growth in each <b>club,</b> potential <b>technology</b> spillovers and catch-up issues across industries and countries. growth, efficiency, R&D, stochastic frontier analysis, latent class...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{convergence}} clubs literature from a Schumpeterian perspective, and it follows the idea that cross-country differences {{in the ability to}} innovate and to imitate foreign technologies determine the existence of clustering, polarization and convergence clubs. The study investigates the characteristics of different <b>technology</b> <b>clubs</b> and the growth trajectories that they have followed over time. The cross-country empirical analysis first explores the existence of multiple regimes in the data by means of cluster analysis techniques. It then estimates a technology-gap growth equation in a dynamic panel model specification. The empirical results identify three distinct <b>technology</b> <b>clubs,</b> and show that these are characterized by remarkably different technological characteristics and growth behavior. ...|$|R

A simple screening model is proposed to study the ways in which a university might sell its research to the private sector. It demonstrates that `technology clubs`, where firms pay a fixed fee to join and a relatively low marginal cost for each piece of research, would increase the amount of research commercially developed and would be beneficial to all parties. business-university collaboration, screening, <b>technology</b> <b>clubs...</b>|$|R
