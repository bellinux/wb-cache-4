40|$|This thesis invites geographers to {{pay more}} {{attention}} to public policy research by addressing the need to rethink fiscal decentralization policies in Ghana. By applying “Simandan’s wise stance in human geography” and “Grix’s building blocks of social research design”, I developed a conceptual framework that unites two incommensurable ontological and epistemological research positions in geography—the positive and normative positions. I used the framework to investigate two key research questions. First, does fiscal decentralization actually work in Ghana? Through quantitative analysis of empirical revenue and expenditure data (1994 - 2011) of local governments in Ghana, this study reveals significant issues of inefficiency, inequity, and unaccountability. Local governments generate less revenue, and therefore depend largely on central government transfers for developing their jurisdictions. Worse yet, these transfers are highly unpredictable in terms of amount and timing. Even though a multivariate regression analysis revealed that these transfers are apolitical, the actual disbursement formula tends to focus on equality instead of equity. Additionally, the unclear expenditure assignments in each locality make accountability difficult. In view of these problems, I addressed the question: why is fiscal decentralization held out as a good thing in Ghana? By drawing lessons from Foucault’s and Escobar’s critical discourse analysis, I traced a genealogy of Ghana’s fiscal decentralization. I found that the policy is held out as a good thing in Ghana because of the <b>triangular</b> <b>operation</b> of multiplicities of power, knowledge, and truth regimes at the local, national and international scale. I concluded that although nation-states remains a necessary causal link in fiscal decentralization policy process in Ghana, direct and indirect international involvement have profound effect on these policies. Therefore, rethinking fiscal decentralization involves acknowledging the complex intermingling effects that global, national, and local territories produce...|$|E

40|$|Swaps, barters, and nonmonetary exchanges {{have long}} been frowned upon and decried by purist economists. Not that their {{opinions}} count in the thriving world of local exchange trading systems and international barter networks. In the small bustling market town of Nditam, 250 km north of Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, the activities of women producers show just how deeply rooted modern trade is in ancient practices. Grouped together in the 'Beyii Ndeng' association, which means 'Women, to the Fields' in the Tikar language, they help each other clear land, and sow and harvest their crops. Their complex system of mutual support goes further: to respect fallow patterns, they do not all cultivate the same food crops. This year, those growing sweet potatoes will give part of their crop to those growing macabo or taro. Such exchange is an old tradition with the Tikar people; they have, since ages, traded with the Bedjang pygmies, their neighbours in this central region of Cameroon, without ever using money. What they barter has changed with modernity. Nowadays, one party will give old clothes, salt, soap, lamp oil, and local alcohol, and receive bamboo furniture, game, and muscle power for working on plantations. Lots of LETS [...] . Some people in modern societies yearn for this form of fair trade from the good old years. Since 1993, dozens of LETS (Local Exchange Trading System) projects have been launched in Europe. They started in Canada in 1983 and have spread far and wide throughout the West. They cover a multitude of barters between individuals or communities, and {{for all sorts of}} goods or services: lessons, food, do-it-yourself handiwork, use of computer equipment, helping hands, baby sitting, and many others. The Belgian daily Le Matin runs a swap shop section of small advertisements. In France, the traditional bric-a-brac traders have been joined by a new wave of LETS fairs where nonmonetary exchanges are traded. And LETS services have set up shop in cyberspace with such French-language websites as www. selidaire. org or www. troc-en-france. com. English-speaking services include the International Barter Corporation, with its website www. ubarter. com. In Havana, Cuba, swap traders known as permutas have set up another type of web, where people can exchange apartments as their family situations change through deaths and births. It is hard to quantify these transactions at macroeconomic level, in part because national borders-especially those of ACP countries-are porous, much to the profit of smugglers. But in the case of Russia, the IMF has estimated that one-half of all trade exchanges are through barter. A general estimate is that such transactions represent 10 - 12 % of the volume of all world trade, with all that this means in terms of lost statistics and lost tax revenue. Barter trade took off in its present form in the 1950 s in exchanges between Eastern Bloc countries. In the 1970 s and 1980 s they were built into industrial exchanges and technology transfers, adding a new element to North-South relationships. More recently, in the 1980 s and 1990 s, they have taken on the form of financial compensation through debt conversions and swaps. One such method, known as ÒswitchÓ, is a <b>triangular</b> <b>operation</b> in which two of the three parties set up an agreement for payment. The value of goods exchanged is recorded by the central banks of the countries concerned, and only the outstanding balance is paid in hard currency. As for debt swaps, the debtor country hands over part of its debt liabilities at a discount, in exchange for inward investment or purchase of exports from the country. Since it became a command economy in the 1960 s, Cuba has been, and still is, a past master at barter. It has bartered its sugar production for Soviet and now Russian petrol (in 1997, it swapped 3. 25 million t of sugar for 9. 75 million t of crude oil). In 1995, Fidel Castro's country set up sugar swap deals with France (for wheat), with a British trader, and Iran (for fertilisers). During the 1980 s, some African countries such as Tanzania swapped products like tea for tractors. Nigeria is well known as the most adept barterer on the African continent, swapping its oil for small parts. Smuggling and laundering [...] . The value of bartering is emphasised by the French organisation ADEPTA 1, the association for international exchange of agricultural and food products and technology. It holds that nonmonetary compensation, or countertrade, is an important asset for agricultural development in Southern countries. Similarly, ACECO 2, a French body for countertrade, seeks to maintain a certain ethical code of conduct in nonmonetary exchanges and to 'protect' businesses involved in such trade. Nonetheless, countertrade is an area rife with blows below the belt. It is well known {{as a way to get}} products for a price below their market value. It is also a way for some operators to offload surplus production. And countertrade does not go unchallenged either. The famous swap between France and China involving Airbus planes and textiles and clothes has had a drastic effect on the French textile sector. In the early 1990 s, Rwanda swapped a good part of its bean crop for weapons; the result was the terrible massacre of the ethnic groups. Similarly, the ongoing armed conflicts in Angola, Sierra Leone, and ex-Zaire are fed by barters of arms for precious stones. The Russian mafia operates in these countries as well to launder its dirty money. But the consequences of countertrade are not always so dire. In Cameroon caps of beer bottles marked by the breweries with a winning symbol can be swapped at any beer outlet for a free beer. The winning caps are sometimes accepted as a ticket to ride [...] . by taxi drivers. 1. The ADEPTA association was set up in 1997 by the French Ministry of Agriculture. It brings together 210 businesses in sectors ranging from agricultural development to food processing. Its mission is to assist its members in identifying business partners and to promote contacts through trade missions, exhibitions, and fairs. 2. ACECO is a private French body, specialised in partnership and advisory services for commercial negotiation and export finance for countertrade. It organises training courses and information services by sector and assists its member businesses for projects, financial engineering, and seeking opportunities in countertrade.

We will discuss the link between such kind of functions and the generators, and their pseudoinverse, of continuous Archimedean triangular subnorms...|$|R
40|$|If {{financial}} markets displayed the informational efficiency postulated in the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), arbitrage operations would be self-extinguishing. The present paper considers arbitrage sequences in foreign exchange (FX) markets, in which trading platforms and information are fragmented. In Kozyakin et al. (2010) and Cross et al. (2012) {{it was shown}} that sequences of <b>triangular</b> arbitrage <b>operations</b> in FX markets containing 4 currencies and trader-arbitrageurs tend to display periodicity or grow exponentially rather than being self-extinguishing. This paper extends the analysis to 5 or higher-order currency worlds. The key findings are that in a 5 -currency world arbitrage sequences may also follow an exponential law as well as display periodicity, but that in higher-order currency worlds a double exponential law may additionally apply. There is an "inheritance of instability" in the higher-order currency worlds. Profitable arbitrage operations are thus endemic rather that displaying the self-extinguishing properties implied by the EMH.

40|$|Graph is {{a useful}} tool to model {{complicated}} data structures. One important task in graph analysis is assessing node proximity based on graph topology. Recently, Random Walk with Restart (RWR) tends to pop up as a promising measure of node proximity, due to its proliferative applications in e. g. recommender systems, and image segmentation. However, the best-known algorithm for computing RWR resorts to a large LU matrix factorization on an entire graph, which is cost-inhibitive. In this paper, we propose hybrid techniques to efficiently compute RWR. First, a novel divide-and-conquer paradigm is designed, aiming to convert the large LU decomposition into small <b>triangular</b> matrix <b>operations</b> recursively on several partitioned subgraphs. Then, on every subgraph, a “sparse accelerator” is devised to further reduce the time of RWR without any sacrifice in accuracy. Our experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that our approach outperforms the baseline algorithms {{by at least one}} constant factor without loss of exactness...|$|R

The labeling enables the implementation of the quadtrees corresponding to the individual triangle faces of the icosahedron as linear quadtrees (i. e., pointer-less quadtrees).

Triangular fuzzy numbers are introduced to express the train’s activity times and {{to aid in the}} modelling using workflow nets of the running processes of high-speed trains. A workflow net links all the activities of a train’s running processes into a sequence called a train running workflow net for high-speed trains. The main job of a triangular fuzzy number workflow net is <b>triangular</b> fuzzy number <b>operation.</b> The principles of this operation are discussed in this paper. The connotations of the two modes of operation of train running workflow nets—sequential mode and alternative mode—are also analysed.
