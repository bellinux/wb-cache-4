25|$|With {{the onset}} of World War I, the British {{stiffened}} censorship and restrictions on political activity. Azad's Al-Hilal was consequently banned in 1914 under the Press Act. Azad started a new journal, the Al-Balagh, which increased its active support for nationalist causes and communal unity. In this period Azad also became active in {{his support for the}} Khilafat agitation to protect the position of the Sultan of Ottoman Turkey, who was considered the Caliph or Khalifa for Muslims worldwide. The Sultan had sided against the British in the war and the continuity of his rule came under serious threat, causing distress amongst Muslim conservatives. Azad saw an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>energise</b> Indian Muslims and achieve major political and social reform through the struggle. With his popularity increasing across India, the government outlawed Azad's second publication under the Defence of India Regulations Act and arrested him. The governments of the Bombay Presidency, United Provinces, Punjab and Delhi prohibited his entry into the provinces and Azad was moved to a jail in Ranchi, where he was incarcerated until 1 January 1920.|$|E

The crane-like device was built almost entirely using Meccano parts, and powered by a single electric motor. [...] Five axes of movement were possible, including grab and grab rotation. Automation was achieved using punched paper tape <b>to</b> <b>energise</b> solenoids, which would facilitate {{the movement of the}} crane's control levers. The robot could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot's single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.|$|E

His books on meditation include: Happy to Burn: Meditation <b>to</b> <b>Energise</b> Your Spirit (Lothian 1997) and Love & Imagination. His first novel, Levin's God (2004), was published by Fremantle Arts Centre Press. The Sydney Morning Heralds reviewer, Juliette Hughes, felt the book was [...] "like the reminiscences of an old rock-dog" [...] and his writing was [...] "prolific and specific and sometimes tells more than some {{of us want to}} know, but keeps us turning those hundreds of pages just to find out what happens to everyone". John Taylor became a film maker and graphics designer. He won an AFI award for The Huge Adventures of Trevor, a Cat in the category of Best Short Animation in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Although Vivekananda did {{not write}} any commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, his works {{contained}} numerous references to the Gita, such as his lectures on the four yogas – Bhakti, Gyaana, Karma, and Raja. Through {{the message of the}} Gita, Vivekananda sought <b>to</b> <b>energise</b> the people of India to claim their own dormant but strong identity. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay thought that the answer to the problems that beset Hindu society was a revival of Hinduism in its purity, which lay in the reinterpretation of Bhagavad Gita for a new India. Aurobindo saw Bhagavad Gita as a [...] "scripture of the future religion" [...] and suggested that Hinduism had acquired a much wider relevance through the Gita. Sivananda called Bhagavad Gita [...] "the most precious jewel of Hindu literature" [...] and suggested its introduction into the curriculum of Indian schools and colleges. In the lectures Chinmayananda gave, on tours undertaken to revive of moral and spiritual values of the Hindus, he borrowed the concept of Gyaana yajna, or the worship to invoke divine wisdom, from the Gita. He viewed the Gita as a universal scripture to turn a person from a state of agitation and confusion to a state of complete vision, inner contentment, and dynamic action. Teachings of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organisation which spread rapidly in North America in the 1970s and 1980s, are based on a translation of the Gita called Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.|$|E

The Cape Flats has generally been represented as a place of poverty, crime and hopelessness and existing on the 'fringe' of the city. This article seeks to complicate our understandings and imaginings of the Cape Flats by focusing on Rylands. In its focus on the middle class, it argues that they transformed their physical surroundings. Spaces in Rylands, built by Indian capital, also offered the Cape Flats useful resources. As an apartheid-designated space, Rylands had {{a significant role in the}} entrenching of Indianness leading <b>to</b> <b>energised</b> cultural and religious activity with temples and mosques becoming the centre for residents.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of new fibre optic based sensors for liquid level and temperature measurement. For the measurement of fluid level an intrinsic sensor has been developed whereby the fibre itself forms the sensing medium. This fibre is made from a plastic, doped with a dye that fluoresces when illuminated by ultra-violet light. The sensing fibre is continuously illuminated but the fluid around it absorbs the light and hence the fluid level controls the intensity of light generated within the fluorescing fibre. The measurement of temperature forms the bulk of this thesis with liquid crystals being used as the transducing medium. Many different schemes have been investigated and characterised using their thermo chromic, light scattering, and electro-optic properties. The latter necessitated the production of miniature photovoltaic devices which, apart from being a novel way of generating quasi-regulated electrical power, provide an alternative approach <b>to</b> <b>energising</b> many other types of hybrid sensor systems that at present are forced to use more complex techniques. Finally a simple theory has been developed to describe the behaviour of the liquid crystal based systems. The theory has been solved numerically and is in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Mn 2 + {{alters the}} balance between the {{simultaneous}} uptake and release of Ca 2 + across the mitochondrial inner membrane toward a lower external level. Addition of as little as 0. 5 microM Mn 2 + <b>to</b> <b>energised</b> mitochondria from rat liver, rat heart or guinea-pig brain changed {{the level at which}} they buffered Ca 2 + in the medium. That extramitochondrial Mn 2 + was responsible was suggested by a partial decay in the shift in Ca 2 + steady state at a rate similar to the rate at which Mn 2 + was accumulated by the mitochondria. The alteration of transmembrane Ca 2 + distribution by Mn 2 + required that both Mg 2 + and Pi be present, and was almost maximal at Mg 2 + and Pi levels in the physiological range. Substitution of spermine or Ni 2 + for Mg 2 +, or acetate for Pi, abolished the effect. In contrast to Sr 2 +, Mn 2 + did not inhibit either EGTA- or Ruthenium red-induced release of Ca 2 + from the mitochondria. However, when flux through the uniporter was rate-limiting, Mn 2 + accelerated Ca 2 + uptake. The stimulation showed hyperbolic kinetics, with an element of competition discernible in the Mn 2 +-Mg 2 + interaction. Thus, extramitochondrial Mn 2 + at levels occurring in vivo can alter the mitochondrial 'set-point' by stimulating Ca 2 + influx through the uniporter...|$|R

25|$|Acceleration of auroral charged {{particles}} invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which {{is believed to}} predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle {{in the direction of}} the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution <b>to</b> the <b>energising</b> processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|Originally, {{track circuit}} interrupters were {{directly}} connected to the rail, both physically and electrically. One of the track circuit tail cables would {{be connected to the}} interrupter, it being connected to the rail. If the interrupter was broken, it was possible that the broken part, with cable still attached, could drop onto the rail and allow the track circuit <b>to</b> remain <b>energised</b> and show 'clear'. To overcome this, it is now practice for track circuit interrupters to be insulated from the rail to which they are attached. A track circuit cable is taken via the interrupter, with one end connected to the upper part of it and another end to the lower part. The cable is at opposite polarity to the rail, therefore should the broken part of the interrupter drop onto the rail, the track circuit will be short circuited and show 'occupied'.|$|R
