25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the Fourier transform, in <b>time-frequency</b> <b>analysis,</b> one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals {{in a form that}} has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the short-time Fourier transform or fractional Fourier transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous wavelet transform.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{complete}} set of Hermite functions provides {{a resolution of the}} identity, the Fourier transform can be represented by such a sum of terms weighted by the above eigenvalues, and these sums can be explicitly summed. This approach to define the Fourier transform was first done by Norbert Wiener. Among other properties, Hermite functions decrease exponentially fast in both frequency and time domains, and they are thus used to define a generalization of the Fourier transform, namely the fractional Fourier transform used in <b>time-frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b> In physics, this transform was introduced by Edward Condon.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{are observed}} throughout {{the central nervous}} system at all levels, and include spike trains, local field potentials and large-scale oscillations which can be measured by electroencephalography (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using <b>time-frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b> In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a neural ensemble, also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory.|$|E

Real-time fault diagnosis has grabbed attention of researchers in looking for a better approach to overcome current limitation. The parameters of health condition in machinery could be monitored thus faults could be detected and diagnosed by using signal analysis approach. Since some fault signals are non-stationary or time dependent in nature, therefore <b>time-frequency</b> signal <b>analysis</b> is crucial for machinery fault diagnosis. Common <b>time-frequency</b> signal <b>analysis</b> methods are such as short time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelets analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), etc. This review provides {{a summary of the}} basic principle of signal analysis, the most recent researches, and some advantages and limitations associated to each types of time frequency signal analysis method...|$|R

25|$|Next to evoked {{activity}}, neural activity {{related to}} stimulus processing {{may result in}} induced activity. Induced activity refers to modulation in ongoing brain activity induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced activity is amplitude change in oscillatory activity. For instance, gamma activity often increases during increased mental activity such as during object representation. Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using <b>time-frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b> Induced activity generally reflects the activity of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory activity are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural activity, for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory activity are therefore {{often referred to as}} event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization.|$|E

This work has investigated in detail the application of several Cohen class time frequency distributions to Heart Rate Variability Signals. The clinical application of these tools to these physiological signals has been limited. Using simulated nonstationary and stationary HRV signals, {{it has been shown}} that the time-frequency spectral estimators such as smoothed pseudo-Wigner and the exponential distribution offer better performance over the Short Time Fourier Transform in terms of resolution and ability to track the nonstationary behavior or instantaneous frequency if the parameters used in the distributions are carefully chosen. These <b>time-frequency</b> spectral <b>analysis</b> tools have been used as a means to quantify the autonomic tone for seven adults under the effects of right unilateral stellate blockade. The mean peak amplitudes under the predefined low frequency (LF) band (0. 05 - 0. 15 Hz) and high frequency band (0. 15 - 0. 45 Hz) were computed for pre and post blockade conditions in the supine and standing positions. These results have demonstrated the partial stellate blockade decreased the LF areas by 33 % when standing and underlines the importance of efferents from the contralateral and higher cervical ganglia in the control of heart rate.

30|$|Time-frequency signal {{processing}} arose {{due to the}} need for accurate representation and efficient analysis and processing of nonstationary signals[17]. Nonstationary signals are very common natural phenomena. They are characterised by their time-varying frequency content which make them unsuitable for analysis by traditional methods, such as Fourier transform, that assume stationarity. <b>Time-frequency</b> signal <b>analysis</b> uses TFDs to represent signals in the joint time-frequency domain and is, therefore, capable of tracking signals’ spectral change over time.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are various}} {{alternatives}} to the DFT for various applications, prominent among which are wavelets. The analog of the DFT is the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). From {{the point of view}} of <b>time–frequency</b> <b>analysis,</b> a key limitation of the Fourier transform is that it does not include location information, only frequency information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients. As wavelets have location as well as frequency, they are better able to represent location, at the expense of greater difficulty representing frequency. For details, see comparison of the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete Fourier transform.|$|E
2500|$|This {{fourfold}} periodicity of the Fourier transform {{is similar}} to a rotation of the plane by 90°, particularly as the two-fold iteration yields a reversal, and in fact this analogy can be made precise. While the Fourier transform can simply be interpreted as switching the time domain and the frequency domain, with the inverse Fourier transform switching them back, more geometrically it can be interpreted as a rotation by 90° in the time–frequency domain (considering time as the -axis and frequency as the -axis), and the Fourier transform can be generalized to the fractional Fourier transform, which involves rotations by other angles. This can be further generalized to linear canonical transformations, which can be visualized as the action of the special linear group [...] on the time–frequency plane, with the preserved symplectic form corresponding to the uncertainty principle, below. This approach is particularly studied in signal processing, under <b>time–frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Human speech {{signals are}} {{inherently}} multi-component non-stationary signals. Recognition schemes for classification of non-stationary signals generally require {{some kind of}} temporal alignment to be performed. Examples of techniques used for temporal alignment include hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping. Attempts to incorporate temporal alignment into artificial neural networks {{have resulted in the}} construction of time-delay neural networks. The nonstationary nature of speech requires a signal representation that is dependent on time. <b>Time-frequency</b> signal <b>analysis</b> is an extension of conventional time-domain and frequency-domain analysis methods. Researchers have reported on the effectiveness of time-frequency representations to reveal the time-varying nature of speech. In this thesis, a recognition scheme is developed for temporal-spectral alignment of nonstationary signals by performing preprocessing on the time-frequency distributions of the speech phonemes. The resulting representation is independent of any amount of time-frequency shift and is time-frequency shift-tolerant (TFST). The proposed scheme does not require time alignment of the signals and has the additional merit of providing spectral alignment, which may have importance in recognition of speech from different speakers. A modification to the counterpropagation network is proposed that is suitable for phoneme recognition. The modified network maintains the simplicity and competitive mechanism of the counterpropagation network and has additional benefits of fast learning and good modelling accuracy. The temporal-spectral alignment recognition scheme and modified counterpropagation network are applied to the recognition task of speech phonemes. Simulations show that the proposed scheme has potential in the classification of speech phonemes which have not been aligned in time.
