Robinson finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship standings, making her the first woman to finish within the top-six final standings in an American national oval <b>track</b> <b>motor</b> sports series. In 2001, Robinson returned to NASCAR to drive the No. 99 Michael Waltrip Racing car for three races in the Busch Series with the objective of obtaining a season-long drive in 2002. The seat materialized when she met Tim Butler and Ken Butler of Aaron's at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the fall of 2000. She later {{received a phone call from}} team owner/driver Michael Waltrip who arranged a three-race agreement, but did not reply being under contact with Kranefuss. Bobby Kennedy acted as Robinson's crew chief. In her three races, she achieved one top-20 finish but did not finish the first two events having been involved in crashes. She continued a strong run in ARCA Series with two top-ten finishes in the season's first two races.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new method for tracking features in video. This method estimates {{the displacement of}} a feature between two successive frames by minimizing an error function {{defined in terms of}} the feature intensities at these frames. Feature tracking relies on a rigid motion model, which allows for translation, rotation and uniform scaling of the feature tracked from one frame to the next. The proposed feature tracking method is used to extract motor activity signals from video recordings of neonatal seizures.
