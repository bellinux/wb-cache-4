It may be the core of an indoor positioning system which can rely on ultrasound alone, as no radio, no infrared channel nor any tether is required. The main hardware components are a <b>tag</b> (<b>transmitter)</b> and a detector (receiver). The detector uses digital signal processing {{to cope with the}} acoustic environment and its noise, reverberations and Doppler shift. The attainable range is 10 - 20 meters and by making a comparison with the range for speech and for the Silbo whistling language, we find that the range can be predicted well. The channel efficiency of the system is found to approach 0. 025 bits per second per Hz. This is somewhat less than speech which also has to deal with a similar environment. This comparison is done by using the Shannon channel capacity theorem. It indicates that there is a potential for improvement which will impact capacity in a positioning system as the channel is time-shared among the transmitters. The output energy of the system is compared to currently accepted exposure limits and found to be safe. I...|$|E

Between March 2005 and September 2006, 15 subadult prickly sharks (170 to 270 cm total length) were <b>tagged</b> with {{acoustic}} <b>transmitters</b> and tracked to determine their site fidelity, home range, habitat use, rates of movement, and diel activity. An array of moored receivers extending 3. 5 km offshore from {{the apex of the}} Monterey Canyon recorded the occurrence of 8 sharks <b>tagged</b> with coded <b>transmitters</b> for 400 to 561 d. Four sharks were <b>tagged</b> with continuous <b>transmitters</b> and monitored by a moored receiver that recorded date, time, and depth for 123 to 212 d.

40|$|Jellyfish {{have become}} a topic of {{interest}} of many marine scientists and managers alike due to their conspicuous socio-economic and environmental impacts. However, our knowledge about their "everyday life" remains limited. While electronic <b>tags</b> (<b>transmitters</b> and loggers) have been extensively used to study marine vertebrates for the past 50 years, tagging {{is still in its}} infancy for marine invertebrates and jellyfish in particular. Progress has been hampered by the difficulty and limited knowledge of attaching tags to soft-bodied animals. We argue that there is huge potential to use tagging to gather basic information on the ecology and behaviour of these species. Here, we give an overview of what has been learned so far by deploying tags on jellyfish, and why tagging is an appropriate method to study their behaviour and ecology. We then describe different tagging techniques, their advantages, disadvantages and challenges, and the steps to ensure future successful jellyfish tagging studies...|$|R

40|$|We tested {{if it is}} {{technically}} feasible to monitor fish in real-time in full-scale commercial fish farms using acoustic telemetry. 31 Atlantic salmon were equipped with acoustic <b>transmitter</b> <b>tags</b> containing depth sensors. Tagged fish were monitored for three months in two industrial scale sea-cages containing 180000 and 150000 fish, respectively. Each cage was fitted with two prototype acoustic receiver units designed to collect, interpret and store the information transmitted by the acoustic <b>transmitter</b> <b>tags.</b> Ten in each cage were also equipped with Data Storage Tags (DSTs) containing depth sensors to record individual-based datasets for comparison with the acoustically transmitted datasets. After compensation for sample loss caused by expected acoustic interference between the <b>transmitter</b> <b>tags,</b> the resulting dataset revealed that the receiver units collected 90 – 95 % of the signals in both cages. Acoustic communication conditions in the sea-cages were not strongly impaired by factors such as fish density and local noise. Further, the dataset from the acoustic transmitters had comparable resolution and quality to that produced by the DSTs. However, acoustic tags provide data in real time and enable farmers {{to respond to the}} received information with farm management measures, whereas archival tags such as DSTs need to be retrieved and downloaded and hence have no real-time applications. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is feasible as a method to monitor the depth of fish in real-time commercial aquaculture...|$|R

40|$|Radio {{transmitters}} provide {{data that}} enhance understanding of raptor biology (Walls and Kenward 2007) {{and are now}} used to answer a multitude of research questions (Meyburg and Fuller 2007). However, transmitters affect the birds that carry them (Barron et al. 2010), {{and it is important}} to document and evaluate such effects (Casper 2009). For example, decreased survival has been documented in Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus; Steenhof et al. 2006), Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis; Reynolds et al. 2004), and Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis; Paton et al. 1991) <b>tagged</b> with radio <b>transmitters.</b> However, no such effects were reported for Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus; Fuller et al. 1998, McGrady et al. 2002) {{and a number of other}} species (Kenward 2001). White and Garrott (1990) noted that in general, animals <b>tagged</b> with radio <b>transmitters</b> often altered their behaviors for 1 – 14 d after release during an adjustment period that included increased preening and grooming frequencies. Although more than 90 Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) have been <b>tagged</b> with radio <b>transmitters</b> (e. g., Burnham 2007, McIntyre et al. 2009, T. Booms unpubl. data), the effects of transmitters on this species are not well documented. Anecdotal information suggests some Gyrfalcons might be negatively affected by radio-tagging (Booms et al. 2008). As part of a study investigating Gyrfalcon breeding biology, we conducted opportunistic, focused observations on two radio-tagged adult female Gyrfalcons and their unmarked mates.

50|$|The {{operator}} attaches a transmitter to {{an animal}} that gives off unique electromagnetic radio signals, which allows the animal to be located. Transmitters are available {{in a variety of}} forms and consist of an antenna, a power source, and the electronics required to produce a signal. Transmitters are chosen based on the behavior, size, and life history of the specific species being studied. In order to reduce the impact of the transmitter on the animal's behavior and quality of life, transmitters typically weigh no more than five percent of the animal's body weight. Unfortunately, the smaller the transmitter, the weaker and shorter-lived it is. Transmitters are often designed to fall off the animal {{at the conclusion of the}} study due to the unlikelihood of recapturing the tagged animals. Large animals require transmitters in the form of collars, which leave room for the animal to grow without falling off. Ear <b>tag</b> <b>transmitters</b> are commonly attached to the ear of large animals that have changing neck sizes. Lightweight, adhesive transmitters are glued to the backs of smaller animals, such as bats. Necklace packs are transmitters that fit around the neck of upland game birds. Subcutaneous transmitters are applied to aquatic animals, which allows them to freely navigate underwater. Whip antennas are an omni-directional transmitter design that produces more signal over a greater distance. A harness loop antenna design, implemented for small birds, involves a transmitter being wrapped around the body.|$|R

40|$|Context. Wild pigs are an {{invasive}} species linked to numerous negative impacts on natural and anthropogenic ecosystems {{in many regions}} of the world. Robust estimates of juvenile wild pig survival are needed to improve population dynamics models to facilitate management of this economically and ecologically important {{invasive species}}. Despite this critical knowledge gap, to date no successful known-fate study of wild piglet survival (3 ̆c 5 months of age) has been conducted, {{due to a lack}} of appropriate method for this species. Aims. To aid in locating and tagging neonates, we piloted the use of vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) in adult wild pigs and evaluated average retention times of stud ear-tag transmitters, clip ear-tag transmitters, sutured and epoxied transmitters, harness transmitters, and surgically implanted transmitters to monitor known-fate survival of piglets. Methods. We captured pregnant female pigs and implanted them with VITs. We tagged subsequently located neonates and piglets captured in traps with the aforementioned transmitters and monitored them to determine retention times and feasibility of each method. Key results. VITs were effectively used to determine the location and time of wild pig parturition, allowing counting and tagging of neonate wild pigs. Stud ear-tag and abdominal implant transmitters were well retained by piglets weighing ≥ 3 kg, in contrast to the other tested transmitters. Conclusions. Stud ear-tag and abdominal implant transmitters allowed known-fate monitoring of juvenile wild pigs, although, of these, stud ear-tag transmitters may be more practical as they do not require field surgery on piglets. Due to their relatively large size, the stud ear <b>tag</b> <b>transmitters</b> were infeasible for monitoring of true neonates (1 kg); however, this application method may be suitable for neonates upon development of lighter-weight transmitters. The other transmitter attachment methods we tested were ineffective for monitoring of piglet survival, due to poor retention of transmitters. Implications. The techniques piloted in this study will facilitate research into the reproductive ecology of wild pigs and known-fate studies of piglet mortality to aid in population modelling and evaluation of cause-specific mortality and factors affecting survival of these often-invasive animals...|$|R
