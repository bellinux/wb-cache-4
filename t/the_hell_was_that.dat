40|$|This exegesis will outline genre and {{development}} within {{the draft of}} the novel; The Annihilation Enigma. This novel has developed and evolved over ten months, influenced by novels, comic books, television shows and roleplaying games, in addition to taking feedback and guidance from a mentor. The novel sits with the dark fantasy and sword and sorcery subgenres of fantasy, illustrating the journey of multiple protagonists all trying to survive. All of these protagonists struggle through <b>the</b> metaphorical <b>hell</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> presented to them, mostly through combat and self-discovery. 	The exegesis discusses the purpose of features within the genre {{in relation to the}} novel and the characters involved. These elements of genre include the high amount of combat and violence, and the extensive existence of magic. The novel was written similarly to the way a dungeons and dragons campaign is formed, as an organic and reactionary story with more of an outline and less of a plan. The aim of the novel is to provide a cathartic journey back from a metaphorical underworld, and subsequently and hopefully provide a similar catharsis to those who need a fight to win...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{argument}} against <b>the</b> justice of <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> humans <b>are</b> not culpable for their sins, since sinning is unavoidable to them. For all have sinned, and come {{short of the}} glory of God; (Epistle to the Romans, 3:23) However, the statement [...] "all have sinned" [...] does not necessarily indicate <b>that</b> sin <b>is</b> unavoidable (Hebrews 4:15) Also, if God is omniscient/prescient, he {{is aware of the}} outcome before anyone enters into Heaven or <b>Hell.</b> From <b>the</b> reasoning that God created them in the first place, some {{go so far as to}} ascribe to Him the culpability for a person's eternal fate. The question is all the more burning if one states exactly this (positive reprobation, Calvinism). However, the (theoretically distinct) doctrine of negative reprobation without consideration of future demerits (Domingo Báñez) — God elects some, the others fall into sin on their own, but of necessity, and are then judged for their sins—will be felt not so much distinct [...] "in practice". If the angels and the blessed without inconvenience to their free will partake of an irresistible grace (which is thus shown possible), even who holds an at least conditional election of every human being (Molinism and, despite notable academic success of Thomist grace theology within the Catholic pale, in practice the stand of Catholics) needs to say that God could have rescued some and did not. Here, again, the discussion shades into that on the problem of evil.|$|R

[...] He told me to play it again, but I failed to play the lick the same as I had just done moments before and he kept badgering me to re-discover the lick. I didn't. But after recording some other songs, I again went to tune up my Gibson and the lick burst forth again. Rob Grange yelled 'That's it! That's it!' So I played it a few times, showed the guys where I wanted to stop and start it up again, turned on the tape machine and recorded it in one fell swoop, making up the lyrics as I went along, articulating {{to the best of my}} ability my take on the great Indian legend of the spiritual beast of yore.
