5|$|Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} a {{concession}} on a route from Norway to New York on 27 March 1950. This would allow the airline to connect <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> the Hong Kong-flights, giving one continual service. The proposal would involve the purchase of Douglas DC-6B or Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} government on 19 April. The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was granted, and on 14 January 1953 for an extension of the concession for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected the concession application, stating that Norway was bound to grant the concession to SAS {{on the basis of the}} merger agreement.|$|E

The website includes articles by archivists, historians and scholars; maps; document examples; name lists for about a dozen towns; {{as well as other}} reference material. Much of this information now available online was originally published in two books by <b>the</b> <b>Routes</b> <b>to</b> Roots Foundation, although the books include additional detailed content and images. As part of the activities of <b>the</b> <b>Routes</b> <b>to</b> Roots Foundation, Weiner donated copies of the books to the individual archives in Poland, Ukraine, and Moldova in appreciation of their assistance and as a way to improve the discoverability of their holdings relating to Jewish genealogical sources. Weiner also donated copies of the books to Jewish genealogical organizations.|$|R

5|$|Studies and {{environmental}} assessments into various extensions began {{almost immediately after}} the completion of <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> Newmarket in 1989; it would take over a decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion of <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening of the route that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen Green Lane – at that time an unpaved rural route – into a bypass of the town.|$|E

5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> the exit.|$|E
5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate.

Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>to</b> the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method.
