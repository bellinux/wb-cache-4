5|$|At Boyd's suggestion, the Beatles {{attended}} the Maharishi's lecture at the London Hilton on Park Lane on 24 August 1967. The Maharishi had announced {{his intention to}} retire, so this {{was expected to be}} his last public lecture in the West. Some band members had seen him on a Granada <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> years earlier. The Beatles were given front row seats and were invited to meet the Maharishi in his hotel suite after the lecture. During the ninety-minute meeting, he invited them to be his guests at a training retreat in Wales.|$|E

On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety <b>TV</b> <b>program,</b> The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show.

5|$|Iftah Ya Simsim was {{the first}} children's {{educational}} <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> {{of its kind in}} the Arab world and the first Sesame Street co-production in the region. It {{was the first}} co-production to use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its development was similar to that of the American version of Sesame Street in the late 1960s. The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E

5|$|During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed {{a lawsuit}} against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the {{previous}} week. Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled First Contact. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions. The <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published Contact and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.|$|E

30|$|For the Serbian digital {{terrestrial}} broadcasting project, the estimated number of <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> for defined coverage zone (n) is 33 and, by using diagram in Figure 3 and Equation (16), we calculated {{the number of}} <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> per one multiplex in DVB-T -j 1 = 9, the number of <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> per one multiplex in DVB-T 2 - j 2 = 16, k = 4 number of multiplexes and RF channels and a = 28 number of <b>TV</b> <b>programs.</b> The simulation results from profit/loss analysis we have carried out by applying the model to the Serbian market are presentedon the four following diagrams. Except two input variables (P and m), all others are kept constant as defined in this section. The commercial parameter P and market parameter m are taken with two different values each.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his <b>TV</b> <b>program,</b> and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
