25|$|In tumour cells, whose {{controls}} on replication are damaged, microsatellites may be gained or lost at an especially high frequency during each round of mitosis. Hence a tumour cell line might show a different genetic fingerprint {{from that of}} the host tissue, and, especially in colorectal cancer, might present with loss of heterozygosity. Microsatellites have therefore been routinely used in cancer diagnosis to assess <b>tumour</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E
25|$|DCC {{would fall}} into the {{chromosomal}} instability category. The chromosomal region of 18q has shown consistent LOH for nearly twenty years. Approximately 70% of primary colorectal cancers display LOH in this region, and the percentage increases when comparing early to advanced cancers. This increase in DCC loss in advanced cancer may indicate that DCC loss {{is more important to}} <b>tumour</b> <b>progression</b> than tumour formation. However, region 18q is not the location of DCC alone, and many studies are in conflict when reporting whether 18q LOH is attributable to DCC or other tumour suppressor candidates in the neighbouring areas. Many reviews refuse to comment on DCC due to its history of conflicting information, stating that more study is required.|$|E

Echinacea will increase mononuclear cell granzyme expression. Granzyme {{is able to}} induce apoptosis that will influence <b>tumour</b> mass <b>progression.</b> Objectives : To prove the influence of Echinacea on mononuklear cell granzyme expression and tumour mass in C 3 H mice with breast carcinoma and stress. Methods: Pre and post test control group design experiment in C 3 H mice. Control group: standard C 3 H mice, group 1 : C 3 H mice with stress aroused by applying electric shock, group 2 : C 3 H mice with stress aroused by applying electric shock and treated with Echinacea. After tumor inoculation, the subjects are treated accordingly, and afterwards mononuclear cell granzyme expression and <b>tumour</b> mass <b>progression</b> were measured. One way Anova test and difference test were applied for each group by using Post Hoc Bonferoni Test. Pearson correlation used as statistical analysis of granzyme expression and <b>tumour</b> mass <b>progression</b> Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in granzyme expression (p< 0, 001) between control group and group- 1 and between group- 1 and group- 2, but no significant difference (p= 0, 363) between control group and group- 2.

40|$|BRAF is a main {{oncogene}} {{in human}} thyroid cancer. Here, {{we show that}} BRAF depletion by siRNA or inhibition of its activity by treatment with BRAF inhibitor PLX 4720 decreases migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells expressing oncogenic V 600 EBRAF through a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism, since treatment with the MEK inhibitor U 0126 exerts the same effect. Moreover, over-expression of V 600 EBRAF increases migration and invasion of wild-type BRAF thyroid cells. Using the same strategies, we demonstrate that these effects are mediated by upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Snail with a concomitant decrease of its target E-cadherin, both hallmarks of EMT. These results reveal a novel V 600 EBRAF-induced mechanism in thyroid <b>tumours</b> <b>progression</b> and provides a rationale for using the PLX 4720 inhibitor to target V 600 EBRAF signalling to effectively control progression of thyroid cancer.

25|$|Differences in {{response}} to treatment between HPV-OPC and HPV+OPC may include differences in the extent and manner in which cellular growth-regulatory pathways are altered in the two forms of OPC. For instance in HPV+OPC the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes merely render the p53 and pRb pathways dormant, leaving open the possibility of reactivation of these pathways by down-regulating (reducing) expression of the oncogenes. This {{is in contrast to}} the mutant form of p53 found in HPV-OPC that is associated with treatment resistance. Furthermore, it is suggested that the effects of E6 and E7 on these pathways renders the tumour more radiosensitive, possibly by interference with mechanisms such as DNA repair, repopulation signalling, and cell-cycle redistribution. The microenvironment is also important, with radiation increasing host immune response to viral antigens expressed on the tumour. Also, there is an association between an increase in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and in circulating white blood cells in HPV+OPC patients and better prognosis. This implies a role for an adaptive immune system in suppressing <b>tumour</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{by which}} mechanism neural {{cell adhesion molecule}} (N-CAM) limits beta tumour cell disaggregation and dissemination, we searched for potential downstream genes of N-CAM during beta <b>tumour</b> cell <b>progression</b> by gene expression profiling. Here, we show that N-CAM-deficient beta-cell tumorigenesis is associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics, biological processes known to affect the invasive and metastatic behaviour of tumour cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules emerged as the primary target, i. e. N-CAM deficiency resulted in down-regulated mRNA expression of {{a broad range of}} ECM molecules. Consistent with this result, deficient deposition of major ECM stromal components, such as fibronectin, laminin 1 and collagen IV, was observed. Moreover, N-CAM-deficient tumour cells displayed defective matrix adhesion. These results offer a potential mechanism for tumour cell disaggregation during N-CAM-deficient beta <b>tumour</b> cell <b>progression.</b> Prospective consequences of these findings for the role of N-CAM in beta tumour cell dissemination are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} a tumour in a duct is {{examined}} in order to model ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, the earliest known stage of breast cancer. Interactions between the expansive forces created by tumour cell proliferation and the stresses that develop in the compliant basement membrane are studied using numerical and analytical techniques. Particular attention focuses on the impact that proteolytic enzymes have on the <b>tumour's</b> <b>progression.</b> As the <b>tumour</b> expands and the duct wall deforms, the tumour cells are subjected to mechanical and nutritional stresses caused by high pressures and oxygen deprivation. Such stresses may stimulate the cells to produce proteolytic enzymes that degrade the duct wall, making it more compliant and prone to penetration by the tumour cells. We use our model to compare these two hypotheses for enzyme production and find that mechanical stress is likely the dominant mechanism, with the wall deforming most at {{the centre of the}} duct. We then discuss the biological implications of our theoretical results and suggest possible directions for future work...|$|R

40|$|Bladder {{cancer is}} the fifth most common cancer in Western society, with the global burden {{predicted}} to increase significantly in the foreseeable future. Over 90 % of these bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas of urothelial origin (urothelial carcinomas or UCs) and at presentation, over 70 % will be non‚Äìmuscle-invasive or stage Ta/T 1 tumours, with the remainder being muscle-invasive or stages T 2 - 4. Bladder UC is a highly heterogeneous disease: for the 50 ‚Äì 55 % of bladder cancer patients presenting with Ta tumours, recurrence is the main issue, but for the 20 ‚Äì 25 % of patients presenting with T 1 <b>tumours,</b> <b>progression</b> is the main issue. Progression to, or presentation with, muscle-invasive disease represents the critical step for patients, necessitating more aggressive therapies and carrying significantly worse survival rates. We therefore urgently require detailed molecular insights into the pathogenesis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer so that the disease can be more adequately and appropriately treated at presentation, so that progression from stages Ta/T 1 can be abrogated, and so {{that the risk of}} recurrence following treatment can be minimised. The recently identified bladder cancer stem cells are considered to be mediators of resistance to current therapies and therefore represent strong candidate biological targets.

40|$|Meningiomas {{are mostly}} benign tumours that {{originate}} from the coverings of brain and spinal cord. Only {{a minority of}} cases show progression to an anaplastic tumour (WHO grades II and III). Multiple and familial cases are rare and mostly associated with (hereditary) neurofibromatosis 2 (NF 2). Meningiomas show an unexpectedly high recurrence rate. Also, completely removed low-grade tumours can recur. On a cytogenetic level, meningiomas are the best-studied tumours in humans. The majority of high-grade but {{only a minority of}} low-grade meningiomas show loss of merlin, a cytoskeleton-cytoplasm-linker protein. Merlin is the product of the NF 2 gene located on chromosome 22. A second tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 22 on 22 q 12. 3 is the gene for the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP 3), which appears to be involved in meningioma progression and a high-grade meningioma phenotype. In contrast to other solid <b>tumours,</b> <b>progression</b> of meningiomas is correlated with increasing hypodiploidy, showing characteristic clonal evolutions that mostly include chromosomes 14, 18, and 19 and, more rarely, 6 and 10. Structural aberrations are rare, except for the loss of the short arm of one chromosome 1, which appears to be the decisive step for anaplastic growth. A biostatistical approach has been proposed, using an oncogenetic tree model that estimates the most likely cytogenetic pathways of meningioma patients in terms of accumulation of chromosome changes in tumour cells. The genetic progression score (GPS) estimates the genetic status of a <b>tumour</b> as <b>progression</b> in the corresponding tumour cells along this model. High GPS values are highly correlated with early recurrence of meningiomas (p 10 ¬ñ 4). This correlation holds true even when patients are stratified by WHO grade. Tumour location also has an impact on genetic progression. Clinical relevance of the GPS is demonstrated with respect to origin, WHO grade, and recurrence of the tumour. As a quantitative measure, the GPS allows a more precise assessment of the prognosis of meningiomas than categorical cytogenetic markers based on single chromosomal aberrations. Comparative histochemical and molecular cytogenetic studies point to the alkaline phosphatase gene (ALPL, liver-bone-kidney type) located on 1 p 36. 1 ¬ñp 34 as a candidate tumour suppressor gen...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{growth hormone}} (GH) - and {{prolactin}} (PRL) -secreting pituitary adenomas are considered benign, in many patients, tumour growth and/or invasion constitute a particular challenge. In other <b>tumours,</b> <b>progression</b> relies {{in part on}} dysfunction of intercellular adhesion mediated by the large family of cadherins. In the present study, we have explored the contribution of cadherins in GH and PRL adenoma pathogenesis, and evaluated whether this class of adherence molecules was related to tumour invasiveness. We have first established, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, the expression profile of classical cadherins in the normal human pituitary gland. We show that the cadherin repertoire is restricted and cell-type specific. Somatotrophs and lactotrophs express mainly E-cadherin and cadherin 18, whereas N-cadherin {{is present in the}} other endocrine cell types. This repertoire undergoes major differential modification in GH and PRL tumours: E-cadherin is significantly reduced in invasive GH adenomas, and this loss is associated with a cytoplasmic relocalisation of cadherin 18 and catenins. In invasive prolactinomas, E-cadherin distribution is altered and is accompanied by a mislocalisation of cadherin 18, Œ≤-catenin and p 120 catenin. Strikingly, de novo expression of N-cadherin is present in a subset of adenomas and cells exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype exclusively in invasive tumours. Binary tree analysis, performed by combining the cadherin repertoire with the expression of a subset of known molecular markers, shows that cadherin/catenin complexes {{play a significant role in}} discrimination of tumour invasion...|$|R
