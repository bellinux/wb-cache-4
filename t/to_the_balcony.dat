5|$|Back in San Francisco, Pflueger {{designed}} the Nasser Brothers' 1,830-seat El Rey Theatre (1931) at 1970 Ocean Avenue in pure Moderne style, including a sleek tower topped by an aircraft warning beacon. A mirrored foyer {{in black and}} gold held floral and geometric accents, and twin curved stairways <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> flanked the foyer.|$|E
5|$|The statue was {{administered}} by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 {{and then by the}} Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service. Public access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> around the torch has been barred for safety since 1916.|$|E
25|$|After 1868 <b>the</b> {{building}} continued <b>to</b> evolve, stucco {{was added}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stone {{walls in the}} 1880s and seventy years later wrought iron grill work was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> and porches. Galena Avenue was widened in 1965 forcing {{the removal of the}} original front stairs which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lobby porch.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral in Cologne, Germany: der Kölner Dom. The main {{instrument}} was finished in 1998 and although enormous, {{it is almost}} dwarfed inside the colossal gothic church as it clings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> Klais also restored other organs in the cathedral and added a detached console that operates all of them at once.|$|R
50|$|In The Grand Salon one may {{walk through}} doors leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} <b>balconies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balconies</b> overlook <b>the</b> {{water in the}} New Orleans area of the park. The shows often put on there are also very visible from <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Cabildo {{accepted}} the document and moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> to submit it {{directly to the}} people for ratification. But, because of the late hour and the weather, {{the number of people}} in the plaza had declined. Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to speak on behalf of the people. This wore the patience of the few who were still in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} is eight minutes long. Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video {{features}} a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video {{opens with a}} shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him. Her struggles nevertheless remain futile even when she punches him, and in a final frantic attempt at defense, she smashes a nearby bottle of liquor into his face. The enraged boyfriend throws her over the balcony. Gaga lies {{on the ground in}} her own blood as the photographers continue take pictures of her bloody body and tabloid headlines proclaim that her career is over. According to Rolling Stone this scene pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo.|$|E

50|$|Chérubin {{stands outside}} L'Ensoleillad's balcony, which is next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> of <b>the</b> Countess and the Baroness, and serenades her. Each {{of the three}} women thinks that Chérubin's song is really {{addressed}} to her, and each drops him a keepsake. The Duke, the Count, and the Baron discover that Chérubin is pursuing their wives, and become furious. They come out of hiding and challenge Chérubin to give them satisfaction. Chérubin flees.|$|R
50|$|During {{remodeling}} in 1970s, {{the organ}} and choir were moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>balcony</b> and most chancel furniture removed.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|The story flashes {{forward to}} the first Christmas after the spell is broken. The Prince and Belle give Chip, Mrs. Potts' son, a book to read, which he loves. As the Prince and Belle come out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> he gives her something: a rose.|$|E
25|$|The zombie-romantic comedy film Warm Bodies (2013) and Isaac Marion's 2010 novel {{on which}} it is based draw {{numerous}} parallels to Romeo and Juliette, from the characters' names, relationships, and professions , <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> scene, to the to-the-death feud that is ultimately healed by {{the threat to the}} star-crossed lovers' lives.|$|E

50|$|The Chase Fine Arts Center {{houses the}} Tippets Exhibit Hall, which is {{adjacent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tippets <b>Balcony.</b> <b>The</b> Exhibit Hall is a 4500 sq ft. gallery which often displays {{work done by}} USU students and faculty.|$|R
50|$|The book's cover photo (see illustration), {{depicting}} part of Kerin's {{rescue of}} Nogiri, {{is a clear}} allusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> famous <b>balcony</b> scene in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet - with magic elements added.|$|R
25|$|At the time, Abernathy {{heard the}} shot {{from inside the}} motel room and ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> to find King on the deck, {{bleeding}} profusely from the wound in his cheek. Andrew Young, a colleague from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, first believed King was dead, but found {{he still had a}} pulse.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the pews}} are {{arranged}} with a center aisle {{leading to the}} raised pulpit, flanked by a pipe organ and backed by a decorative entablature with flanking pilasters. A wooden stairway leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> supported by round wooden Doric columns with a frieze around the balcony's edge. The ceiling is embossed tin. Many of these finishes are original.|$|E
25|$|On the inside, {{the ground}} level is of {{stripped}} maple with sheet-iron {{walls and ceiling}} supported by two rows of cast iron columns. A large metal vault is located under the main stairs, which lead to the auditorium. That takes up two stories leading up to an exposed wooden truss ceiling. The three dormers provide light <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> level behind them.|$|E
500|$|However, it was {{ultimately}} determined that poor construction was to blame. In 1998, a permit was issued to owner LG Properties to install furnaces, air conditioners and water heaters in the building, but not <b>to</b> build <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balcony</b> jutted out eleven {{feet from the}} building, one foot further than permitted by city codes, and had an area of , [...] larger than permitted. <b>The</b> <b>balcony</b> also had inadequate supports, was floored with undersized lengths of wood, and was attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls with screws that were too short.|$|R
50|$|During segregation, the {{railroad}} tracks served as a racial divide, with African Americans living <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast of the tracks and <b>the</b> whites <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest. There were few common public events. When a movie theater was erected in the 1930s, blacks were allowed <b>to</b> access <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> from a separate entrance. Whites sat on the main floor.|$|R
25|$|Returning <b>to</b> Buckingham Palace, <b>the</b> Queen {{watches a}} further march-past {{from outside the}} gates. Following a 41-gun salute by the King's Troop in Green Park, she leads the Royal Family on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace <b>balcony</b> for a Royal Air Force flypast.|$|R
25|$|Facing the Palace Square is {{the oval}} Throne Room (Tronsalen) where foreign ambassadors present their {{credentials}} to Queen Margrethe II. The Throne Room gives access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> where the Danish monarchs are proclaimed. The Throne Room {{is decorated with}} a large ceiling painting by Kræsten Iversen, depicting how the Danish flag, Dannebrog, {{fell from the sky}} in Estonia in 1219.|$|E
25|$|In {{two nights}} after his 1846 pardon freeing all {{political}} prisoners, thousands of Romans with torches roamed to the Quirinal Palace, where Pius IX lived, celebrating the pope with Evvivas, speeches and music through both nights. The Pope went several times <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> {{to give his}} blessing. On the third day, when his horse-drawn carriage left the Palace {{to move to the}} Vatican, Romans unhitched the horses and pulled the papal carriage on their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{are divided}} into three separate apartments: two similarly distributed residential units at the first level and a single large apartment at the second. The living quarters, kitchen, and servants' quarters of the upper floor are reached via a series of louvered galleries that open to the courtyard. The living room boasts original crystal chandeliers and electric features. Floors are generally of polished wood and ceilings of ornate pressed sheet-metal. The living room windows open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> which has marble floors and iron railings.|$|E
50|$|Minaret:Eger {{was part}} of the Ottoman Empire for 91 years (1596-1687). During this time, {{numerous}} Turkish buildings were erected in the city, among them a mosque with this minaret. The mosque has not survived the centuries but the minaret, the northernmost one in Europe, is still in perfect condition. Jonathan has to climb 97 steps <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1997, the Narthex {{wall was}} {{moved back to}} its {{original}} location, expanding nave seating for the growing congregation. Stairs now lead up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> renovated <b>balcony</b> above, which is home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> choir and the beautiful English pipe organ installed in 1999.|$|R
50|$|On 7 November 1926, {{eight years}} after the end of the war, the {{monument}} was officially opened by the Mayor of Sherbrooke at the time, James Keith Edwards, before more than 20,000 people. During the ceremony, the family members of the soldiers, sherbrooke personalities and other dignitaries settled in <b>the</b> stands. <b>To</b> watch <b>the</b> event, many of the estimated 15 000 spectators made to mount environments: they climb trees, climb on the roofs of buildings or access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> of buildings and bell tower of the Church of St. Patrick. The newspapers of the time show that the crowd remained calmed with the intensity of the moment and the beauty of the statue, when the white sheet covering was removed.|$|R
25|$|In June 2015, Mayor Bates was at {{the focal}} point of the Berkeley Balcony Collapse tragedy which claimed the lives of 5 young Irish J1 {{students}} and an Irish American student. Mayor Bates was praised by the Irish media for the sensitivity and consideration he showed and the support he gave to the Irish J1 community and the families of the victims of the accident. He promised a broad and wide ranging investigating into the cause of the accident with the likely cause being that the balcony of the building was not constructed properly leading to dry rot developing, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> to become structurally compromised.|$|E
25|$|Naomi and Max throw a {{party for}} their {{marriage}} and Max's business partner Alec invites special guests to build their business up again. Liam and Vanessa turn up at the party together and Vanessa tells everyone that she and Liam are engaged, which causes shock to everyone and Silver disappears to get drunk.

In shock Liam rushes to the phone to call 911 to report an accident and runs back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and sees Vanessa's body is gone.|$|E
25|$|The Suttons {{altered the}} house during their tenure. Eliza Sutton seriously {{considered}} adding a library {{to the house}} in 1924, but ultimately decided against it. The house suffered a fire in 1932. Of unknown origin, it started in the basement and destroyed the original veranda roof and caused extensive damage to many of the original furnishings. Unable to determine how the highly cantilevered roof had been anchored in the house, local builders changed its location and proportions and added large plastered columns to support its extension. Later, during World War II, the Suttons added stairs up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> in the northeast corner above the main floor bedroom, added a downstairs bathroom, and made alterations to the second floor in order to house Army Air Corps personnel from the nearby air base who needed temporary quarters.|$|E
50|$|In August 2003, {{the tower}} was painted an {{ultramarine}} blue <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> existing light brown which had started <b>to</b> discolour. <b>The</b> <b>balconies</b> were painted <b>to</b> {{stand out from}} the tower in a dark shade of blue. On 18 March 2004, Jasper Carrott switched on the night time illuminations of the tower in response to Birmingham City Council's policy of encouraging the illumination of local landmarks.|$|R
2500|$|The eloquent {{design of}} the main {{sanctuary}} presented a unique challenge to engineers and architects. The engineering of <b>the</b> magnificent curved <b>balcony,</b> which blends harmoniously with the dome, drew an objection from the NYC Building Department. The department demanded that 20 supporting columns be installed <b>to</b> hold up <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> With assurances from their own engineers, the committee resisted the order since it would mar the structure’s beauty. <b>The</b> <b>balcony</b> had been carefully designed with no visible supports because {{it was to be}} cantilevered off the main structure, which was engineered to be strong enough <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> <b>balcony’s</b> fully loaded weight. Erected in the rear section of the property was a banquet hall used for weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and other social functions. Popularly known as the Social Hall, this facility was also used on Shabbat as an additional space for prayers. The main sanctuary of Shaare Zion opened for 2,100 congregants on the High Holy Days in 1960. The dome, banquet room, terrace room in the basement, and midrash upstairs were all utilized.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, a 53-year-old woman {{crossing}} at a {{red light}} was hit by a car and killed {{in the days leading up}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> convention. In 2013, a young woman attempted <b>to</b> jump off <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of a local high-rise, but nearby stuntmen prevented it.|$|R
