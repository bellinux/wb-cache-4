6000|$|The Antiquary, {{somewhat}} {{in the situation}} of a woodcock caught in his own springe, turned short round and coughed, <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> slight blush as he mustered his answer--"as to the Apostle of the Scottish Reformation"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's unfortunate the laxity you {{complain}} of isn't more common." [...] Andrew {{broke into a}} smile. [...] "No doubt Wannop was too clever for you; but I don't bear you any grudge. I believe you meant well, and good intentions seem <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> good deal of harshness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{title and}} the estates {{meant nothing to}} me without you, dear," [...] he replied. [...] "And if I had taken them away from him I should have been robbing the woman I love--don't you understand, Jane?" [...] It was as though he {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> fault.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, Dunbar {{seemed to}} reveal {{other aspects of}} his private life. Lament for the Makaris is a {{reflection}} on mortality in which he remembers his fellow-poets now deceased. Meditatioun In Wyntir considers ageing and the poet's frustrated ambitions while On His Heid-Ake is apparently <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> lack of productivity by recounting a migraine.|$|R
50|$|Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), was factually {{similar to}} McCollum, {{although}} there was no instruction on school grounds. Although Burton's law clerks argued that the school was tacticly instructing children to attend religious classes, Burton disagreed, characterizing the dismissal as akin <b>to</b> <b>excusing</b> <b>a</b> child from school for a doctor's appointment. Burton joined the 6-to-3 majority.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come then," [...] he cried, {{winking at}} his companions, [...] "since doors are opened, it would speak ill of our {{breeding}} should we refuse to enter. Captain Heathcote {{has been a}} soldier, and he knows how <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> traveller's freedom. Surely one who has tasted of {{the pleasures of the}} camp, must weary at times of this sylvan life!" ...|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. When {{a man has}} {{risked his}} life on eight battlefields, Mrs. Farrell, he has given {{sufficient}} proof of his self-control <b>to</b> be <b>excused</b> <b>a</b> little strong language.|$|R
50|$|This {{story was}} {{maintained}} in part <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> possible mistake {{of the composer}} Óscar Esplá (1886-1976), who asserted that in 1924, he had been shown a letter of 1266 authorizing the play, which was preserved in the Municipal Archives of Elche, {{despite the fact that}} it has never been seen since or even cited. The work carried out by Esplá, and his importance as a composer, revived the theory of the play's origin in the 13th century.|$|R
60|$|Monsieur Thuran {{had been}} trying <b>to</b> find <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> graceful departure. The lull in the {{conversation}} following the moving of their position gave him an opportunity <b>to</b> make his <b>excuses.</b> Bowing low <b>to</b> Miss Strong, and inclining his head to Tarzan, he turned to leave them.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Severo Morales - the {{resident}} bitter old man. Judgmental and cares {{a lot of}} being politically correct. His favorite pastime is visiting popular websites looking for comments that can offend him in order <b>to</b> have <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> enter <b>an</b> argument.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ratcliffe {{shook her}} head. [...] "I don't {{think there is}} any reason why you should disturb yourself," [...] she said. [...] "After all, one has <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> good deal in the case of men who live in the tropics, and though the ways Tom has evidently {{acquired}} there now and then jar on me I venture to believe he will grow out of them and become a credit to you with judicious management. It would, perhaps, be wiser not to mention that letter, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{cautious}} enough," [...] the Major said, drily. [...] "She {{is older}} than you, my poor boy;" [...] and then he apologised with the utmost frankness and humility, and flung himself upon Pen's good feelings, begging the lad <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> fond old uncle, who had only his family's honour in view--for Arthur was ready to flame up in indignation whenever Miss Costigan's honesty was doubted, and swore {{that he would never}} have her name mentioned lightly, and never, never would part from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{have to get}} you <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> me <b>a</b> minute; yonder is {{the witness}} that swore I helped to rob the California coach--a piece of impertinent intermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{here you}} are. I just told Father Esteban that you talked of leaving to-morrow, {{and that he}} would have <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> me <b>a</b> few moments while you showed me what you had done to the old garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|What {{the special}} trouble was, {{in which the}} Psalmist found himself, we are not told. But it is plain from his words, {{that it was just}} that very sort of trouble, in which the world is most ready <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> man for lying, cringing, plotting, and acting on the old devil's maxim that [...] "Cunning is the natural weapon of the weak." [...] For the Psalmist was weak, oppressed and persecuted by the great and powerful. But his method of {{defending}} himself against them was certainly not the way of the world.|$|R

50|$|In Sweden, the law {{of self-defense}} (nödvärn) allows <b>a</b> person {{attacked}} <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> or justify <b>a</b> proportionate use of violence {{in defense of the}} person or property.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a blatant}} bumptiousness about a steam launch {{that has the}} knack of rousing every evil {{instinct}} in my nature, and I yearn for the good old days, when you could go about and tell people what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow and arrows. The expression {{on the face of}} the man who, with his hands in his pockets, stands by the stern, smoking a cigar, is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>a</b> breach of the peace by itself; and the lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would, I am confident, ensure a verdict of “justifiable homicide” from any jury of river men.|$|R

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [With a {{touch of}} bitterness.] I suppose I had better write it at once. Such offers are not repeated. I will ask you <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> me for <b>a</b> moment, Lord Caversham.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the girl}} made her appearance, apologetic, voluble, and excited, Miss Desborough {{scarcely}} listened <b>to</b> her <b>excuses,</b> until <b>a</b> single word suddenly arrested her attention. It was [...] "old Debs." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this time}} a {{messenger}} from Markton barracks arrived at the castle and wished to speak to Captain De Stancy in the hall. Begging the two ladies <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> him for <b>a</b> moment, he went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> me for <b>a</b> while, unless you're dead set {{on having}} it out right now. Mr. Gale {{and his family}} are leaving, and my {{daughter}} is going with them. I'd rather you'd wait a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have a word}} {{of advice}} to give you," [...] she said. [...] "The {{best thing you can}} do, sir, is <b>to</b> make <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> your Minister, and go back to England." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{turned away}} with the Count, who {{preserved}} a perfectly unmoved countenance. Before we had taken half a dozen steps, however, he was accosted by a gentleman entering the hotel, and, turning round, he begged me <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> him for <b>a</b> moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to ask you <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> me for <b>a</b> moment," [...] he said, [...] "while I ring up Number 10 signal tower. If Mr. Quest's story {{receives}} corroboration, the matter is at an end. Where shall I find a telephone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{undersigned}} persons {{think it}} needless to touch on a kindred problem so often discussed at committees for University Reform: {{the question of}} whether dons see double because they are drunk, or get drunk because they see double. It is enough for them (the undersigned persons) if they are able to pursue their own peculiar and profitable theme--which is puddles. What (the undersigned persons ask themselves) is a puddle? A puddle repeats infinity, and is full of light; nevertheless, if analyzed objectively, a puddle is a piece of dirty water spread very thin on mud. The two great historic universities of England have all this large and level and reflective brilliance. Nevertheless, or, rather, on the other hand, they are puddles--puddles, puddles, puddles, puddles. The undersigned persons ask you <b>to</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>an</b> emphasis inseparable from strong conviction." ...|$|R
