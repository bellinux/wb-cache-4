According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action.

In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable.

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In <b>that</b> <b>conversation</b> she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired.|$|E
25|$|Value network {{analysis}} addresses both financial and non-financial value. Every business relationship includes contractual or mandated activities between participants — and also informal exchanges of knowledge, favors, and benefits. The analysis {{begins with a}} visual map or diagram that first shows the essential contractual, tangible revenue- or funding-related business transactions and exchanges that occur between each node of the networks. Nodes represent real people, typically individuals, groups of individuals such as a business unit or aggregates of groups such {{as a type of}} business in an industry network. During analysis when adopting a reflective, double loop or generative learning mode, it is beneficial to regard nodes as role plays (shortened to roles). Practitioners have found {2} <b>that</b> <b>conversation</b> between participants about role plays within a larger whole invariably results in transforming individual behaviour and gaining commitment to implementing needed change as elaborated below.|$|E

The intention of this sanction was to dismantle Los Cuinis' business network and uncover the businesses that were operating illegally with drug money invested in the economy. The U.S. government first heard of Hotelito Desconocido through a wire tap phone conversation Abigael had with Diana María Sánchez Carlón, one of his financial assistants. In <b>that</b> <b>conversation,</b> Abigael asked her how his hotel was doing, prompting the U.S. government to investigate what he was referring to exactly. Sánchez Carlón was introduced to Abigael by Jennifer Beaney Camacho Cázares, a close friend of hers and wife of Abigael.

500|$|The Secret River is Rawlings' only book {{intended}} for children. According to Murray Laurie, {{the idea for}} the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek: “some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child.” She discussed the idea with her Scribner's editor, Maxwell Perkins, who encouraged her to follow it up. While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she [...] "deliberately avoided Negro dialect. 'No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo sort of stuff. At one point she thought about making the story into a full-length novel. Helen Masten, writing for The Saturday Review, commented [...] "Had this happened this little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children, to whom it rightly belongs." [...] Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp, an illustrator and friend. From <b>that</b> <b>conversation,</b> Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea. In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret Rivers manuscript to Perkins, and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings. When Perkins responded with suggestions, Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp's illustrations. By June of that year, Perkins' death from pneumonia and Rawlings' own personal problems had derailed the project. After Rawlings' death in 1953, the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers.|$|E
