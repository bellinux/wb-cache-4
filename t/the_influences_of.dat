40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> commitment, leadership, work environment and compensation to competitive advantages with engagement as intervening variable. Culture of engagement should be acquired by each employee {{in order to}} reach the competitive advantages. Samples were selected with census method or population research. Data are collected by distributing questionnaires to 35 senior high school teachers. Data be analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM) with PLS (Partial Least Squares) program. The result shows that 5 from 9 hypotheses argued are accepted, they are H 2, H 3, H 6, H 7 and H 9.

In the owned-dog population, <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> immigration, abandonment and births was 19 %, 16 % and 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrying capacity, respectively.

5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> Nordic settlers in the region.

Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this {{is the source of the}} merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} the problem <b>of</b> driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol; which {{is due to the fact}} that alcohol is present in every third traffic accident. We studied <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol on a person and his or her driving capabilities, how often people drive under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, and how often it comes up as a {{secondary}} reason for traffic accidents. We also investigated how drivers under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol are treated, and how occurrences of such driving could be prevented. At the end, we described some projects and organizations that deal with the prevention of this problem. In the empiric part, we used a quantitative approach to check the most common reasons for driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. We were also interested in the differences between men and women, and younger and older drivers regarding their opinions on driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. We were also looking for a connection between experiences <b>of</b> driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opinions regarding rising or lowering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. The results show that women rarely drive under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, and are more strongly against driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> than men. We managed to prove a connection between experiences <b>of</b> driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opinions regarding the altering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. There were no significant differences in our sample between younger and older drivers regarding opinions on driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. ...|$|R

5|$|Early on January24, {{the system}} became better {{organized}} and strengthened into a cyclone at 0600UTC. The storm, which was named Arthur by the RSMC Nadi, began to undergo rapid intensification as the structure improved significantly. Deep convection developed around the center with strong outflow towards the north. Several hours after becoming a cyclone, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 09P as it traveled quickly towards the east-southeast. The quick movement {{was due to}} <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> subtropical ridge {{to the north and}} a trough to the south. Later that day, a banding eye feature began to develop as the storm intensified into a Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale. At 1800UTC, the JTWC assessed Arthur to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph 1-minute winds), the equivalent of a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on January25, Arthur reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 975hPa (mbar) while located about 635km (350mi) north-northwest of Rarotonga. Shortly after peaking in intensity, Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition and rapidly deteriorated due to strong wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies that focus on <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of {{research in this field}} is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang is {{a modern}} term for an ancient {{instrumental}} form of music composed on a row of small, horizontally laid gongs that function melodically, accompanied by larger, suspended gongs and drums. As {{part of the larger}} gong-chime culture of Southeast Asia, kulintang music ensembles have been playing for many centuries in regions of the Eastern Malay Archipelago—the Southern Philippines, Eastern Indonesia, Eastern Malaysia, Brunei and Timor, although this article has a focus on the Philippine Kulintang traditions of the Maranao and Maguindanao peoples in particular. Kulintang evolved from a simple native signaling tradition, and developed into its present form with the incorporation of knobbed gongs from Sunda. Its importance stems from its association with the indigenous cultures that inhabited these islands prior to <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity or the West, making Kulintang the most developed tradition of Southeast Asian archaic gong-chime ensembles.|$|E
