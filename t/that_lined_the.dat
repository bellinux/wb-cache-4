5|$|The square {{once was}} {{surrounded}} by an iron fence that was no longer present by 1905. By the 1860s, the square was a heavily wooded park. In 1876-7, trees <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> square along main street were removed.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Athlete or Desultor, {{located near}} the forum, {{contains}} a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched hand. It may possibly represent Silenus. The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus, behind rows of shops <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> street under an arcade. They were entered from side streets between the shops.|$|E
5|$|At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade {{performed}} its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, {{including a}} Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers, it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> entire Suez Canal {{did not exist}} in the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to clear a path.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} then {{taken off the}} pontoon, in {{preparation}} for her re-entry into Bristol, now truly afloat. On Sunday 5 July, amidst considerable media interest, the ship was towed up the River Avon to Bristol. Perhaps the most memorable moment for the crowds <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> final few miles was her passage under the Clifton Suspension Bridge, another Brunel design. She waited for {{two weeks in the}} Cumberland Basin for a tide high enough to get her back through the locks to the Floating Harbour and her birthplace, the dry dock in the Great Western Dockyard (now a grade II* listed building, disused since bomb damage in the Second World War).|$|E
5|$|The French {{executed}} {{several attempts}} to retake the bridges. The 68th, under command of general Jean-Baptiste de Sisce, was repulsed three {{times by the}} superior numbers of Austrians and the fearsome fire of case shot from four cannons <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> principal road. Not until 19:00 did fortune favor the French, when Colonel d'Aspré and two hundred men of the Regiment Ferdinand were captured within the fort itself. The next in command, a Major Delas, was badly wounded, leaving no one in overall command of the 38th Regiment. The French general Schauenburg, {{who had gone to}} Strasbourg for troops, returned with some reinforcements, including part of the Strasbourg national guard, and led these troops over the pontoon bridges. They met at once an impetuous Austrian attack, but were sufficiently strong to recover. At 22:00, the Austrians still held the redoubt and the houses {{at the edge of the}} village; the arrival of a fresh battalion of the 12th Regiment led to a new attack, but it was repulsed. Ultimately, though, the Austrians had insufficient reserves to meet the fresh troops from Strasbourg. By 23:00, the French had recovered all of the Strasbourg suburbs, the village of Kehl and all of the French earthen works.|$|E
25|$|Mahmoud 'Awad, {{fearing the}} Israelis {{might try to}} recover their {{abandoned}} armor, resolved to completely destroy the fifteen tanks and APCs, all damaged or destroyed, <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> streets leading to the square.

25|$|Agra {{became a}} city {{centered}} on its waterfront and developed partly eastwards but mostly westwards {{from the rich}} estates <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> banks.

25|$|With {{the full}} opening of Hyogo Port (modern day Kobe Port) on 1 January 1868, the {{batteries}} <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> coast of Osaka Bay {{were no longer}} required despite never being put to use. Of the other batteries built in Hyogo Prefecture during the 1860s, only the outer granite wall of the Nishinomiya Battery remains after its wooden internal structure was destroyed by fire in 1884. All of the other batteries were sold off to private individuals and demolished during the Meiji period.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century Henry VIII of England, after {{watching}} Royal Waterman in a risky manoeuvre shoot the rapids {{created by the}} twenty small arches of Old London Bridge, decided {{to clean up the}} navigation of the Thames. Wooden structures and water-wheels built out into the river over centuries were removed and the central part of London's Thames retreated behind a semi permanent series of walls <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> sloping foreshore to the river, along these shallow walls, stairs were built down to the water. Two to six-storey houses and shops were built along the shoreline.|$|E

25|$|For {{the poor}} of Paris, life was very different. They were crowded into tall, narrow, five- or six-story high {{buildings}} <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> winding streets on the Île de la Cité and other medieval {{quarters of the}} city. Crime in the dark streets was a serious problem. Metal lanterns were hung in the streets, and Colbert increased to four hundred the number of archers who acted as night watchmen. Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie was appointed the first lieutenant-general of police of Paris in 1667, a position he held for thirty years; his successors reported directly to the king.|$|E
25|$|A census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 {{recorded}} {{a population of}} 8,003 adults spread equally {{north and south of}} the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas. As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> present day Royal Mile and the Cowgate, were exacerbated. Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease, with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.|$|E
25|$|At {{seven in}} the morning the Kandyans appeared, {{covering}} the slopes <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> Danture tract. They waited for the Portuguese to come within range, then opened fire with muskets, gingals and arrows. The brunt of the attack fell on the advance guard; its commander, D. Gastão Coutinho, and several captains including Simão Pereira and Francisco de Brito were killed. This attack slowed the retreat, and the columns came to a halt. The forest concealed the Kandyans, who were able to cause casualties while remaining largely unseen. So the Portuguese decided to charge the enemy in front of them, in order to clear a path.|$|E

25|$|King Dachi I Ujarmeli, {{who was the}} {{successor}} of Vakhtang I Gorgasali, moved the capital from Mtskheta to Tbilisi according to the will left by his father. Tbilisi was not the capital of a unified Georgian state {{at that time and}} did not include the territory of Colchis. It was, however, the capital city of Eastern Georgia/Iberia. During his reign, King Dachi I oversaw the construction of the fortress wall <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's favourable and strategic location which placed the city along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.|$|E
25|$|The street's layout {{is simple}} but elegant. Not {{dissimilar}} to Paris' Champs-Élysées, though more intimate in scale, {{it has a}} wide pavement {{each side of the}} street serving the retail outlets that line its length, and a parallel pair of two-lane (formerly three-lane) roadways. A paved median space runs down the centre of the street, featuring monuments and statues to various Irish political leaders. The famous large London Plane trees <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> median for {{the second half of the}} 20th century were removed in 2003 amidst some controversy, with the oldest of these at the northern end planted c. 1903 being cut down in 2005 – all as part of an extensive regeneration scheme recently completed by Dublin City Council.|$|E
25|$|They {{returned}} to New Guinea, however, arriving at Port Moresby on 22 July, aboard the troopship Duntroon {{in advance of}} the 25th Brigade's advance on Lae. Billeted at the Six Mile Valley camp under canvas, they carried out a number of sub-unit level exercises which culminated in a brigade-level exercise in late August and early September before being flown to Nadzab on 7 September. From there they took part in the Salamaua–Lae campaign, which saw the 7th Division to which the battalion was attached drive on Lae through the Markham Valley. Advancing through the plantations <b>that</b> <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> Markham Road, they encountered only light resistance and the 2/25th, in the vanguard of the Australian force, was the first to enter the town on 16 September.|$|E
