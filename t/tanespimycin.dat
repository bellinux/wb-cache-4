40|$|Recent {{approaches}} to cancer therapy have centered on developing small molecule inhibitors for signaling pathways deranged in common cancers; these compounds are {{sometimes referred to}} as tumor antibiotics. One promising target for tumor antibiotics is Hsp 90, a heat shock protein that plays a central role in promoting the functionality and stability of a group of proteins associated with cancer called client proteins. Hsp 90 inhibitors have been receiving extensive research attention, with geldanamycin, <b>tanespimycin,</b> and their derivatives at the forefront. This report describes a novel, cost-effective, commercial scale process design for the production of <b>tanespimycin.</b> The proposed production facility is designed to deliver 1, 084 kg/year through 55 batches, requiring operation of 293 days/year. Detailed economic analysis suggest the recuperation of funds after an initial investment into the biopharmaceutical plant and Phase III trials, which suggest that further investment in this process design would be highly profitable...|$|E
40|$|Metastatic {{pheochromocytoma}} {{represents one}} of the major clinical challenges in the field of neuroendocrine oncology. Recent molecular characterization of pheochromocytoma suggests new treatment options with targeted therapies. In this study we investigated the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp 90) as a potential therapeutic target for advanced pheochromocytoma. Both the first generation, natural product Hsp 90 inhibitor 17 -allylamino- 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin (17 -AAG, <b>tanespimycin),</b> and the second-generation synthetic Hsp 90 inhibitor STA- 9090 (ganetespib) demonstrated potent inhibition of proliferation and migration of pheochromocytoma cell lines and induced degradation of key Hsp 90 clients. Furthermore, ganetespib induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in primary pheochromocytoma cells. Using metastatic models of pheochromocytoma, we demonstrate the efficacy of 17 -AAG and ganetespib in reducing metastatic burden and increasing survival. Levels of Hsp 70 in plasma from the xenograft studies served as a proximal biomarker of drug treatment. Our study suggests that targeting Hsp 90 may benefit patients with advanced pheochromocytoma...|$|E
40|$|The Hsp 90 molecule, one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} heat shock proteins in mammalian cells, maintains homeostasis and prevents stress-induced cellular damage. Hsp 90 is expressed under normal conditions at a level of about 1 - 2 Percent of total proteins, while its expression increases 2 - 10 fold in cancer cells. The two main constitutively expressed isoforms of Hsp 90 are known as Hsp 90 -alpha and Hsp 90 -beta, and their upregulation is associated with tumor progression, invasion and formation of metastases, as well as development of drug resistance. The Hsp 90 is a key target for many newly established, potent anticancer agents containing Hsp 90 N-terminal ATP binding inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, and its analogues 17 AAG and 17 DMAG. The therapeutic usage of geldanamycin has been limited due to its poor water solubility and severe hepatotoxicity. Therefore, its analogues, including 17 AAG, 17 DMAG, <b>Tanespimycin</b> and Retaspimycin hydrochloride, with improved pharmacokinetic profiles, have been developed...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} pyrazolo[3, 4 -d]pyrimidine {{derivatives}} related to allopurinol has been synthesized and evaluated for its cytotoxicity against {{a panel of}} three cancer cell lines {{as well as its}} xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitory activities. Among them, compound 4 showed potent cytotoxicity with IC 50 values of 25. 5 and 35. 2 μM against human hepatoma carcinoma cell lines, BEL- 7402 and SMMC- 7221, respectively. The anticancer activity of 4 was comparable to that of <b>Tanespimycin</b> (17 -N-allylamino- 17 -demethoxy geldanamycin, 17 -AAG) that inhibited the growth of BEL- 7402 and SMMC- 7221 cells at IC 50 values of 12. 4 and 9. 85 μM, respectively. However, unlike allopurinol, which is also a strong inhibitor of XOD, compound 4 is a much weaker XOD inhibitor, suggesting that the anticancer activities of the allopurinol derivatives may not be associated with XOD inhibition. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of 4 toward normal cells is significantly lower than that of 17 -AAG, making 4 a promising lead compound for further optimization of structure-activity relationships that may lead to anticancer agents of clinical utility...|$|E

Advances in understanding the genetic changes associated {{with the development of}} melanoma resulted in availability of promising new agents that inhibit specific proteins up-regulated in signal cell pathways or inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the RAF/RAS/MEK pathway, elesclomol (STA- 4783) and oblimersen (G 3139), an antisense oligonucleotide targeting anti-apoptotic BCl- 2, are in phase III clinical studies in combination with chemotherapy.

Receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, sunitinib) may have a role in treatment of patients with melanoma harbouring c-Kit mutations. Although often studied as single agents with disappointing results, new targeted drugs should be more thoroughly evaluated in combination therapies. The future of rational use of new targeted agents also depends on successful application of analytical techniques enabling molecular profiling of patients and leading to selection of likely therapy responder...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib (R 115777) {{has been used}} for treatment of hematological malignancies; however, its observed anticancer effect was limited. This prompted us to search for inhibitors that would show synergic, proapoptotic effect when combined with R 115777. We decided to study LY 294002, which inhibits PI- 3 kinase, and <b>tanespimycin</b> (17 AAG), which inhibits Hsp 90 —a chaperone for a number of proteins, including Akt kinase. Methods The effect of drugs, used alone or in combination, was tested in U 937 cells (human leukemic monocyte lymphoma), which are often used as a model for liquid tumor. The number of viable cells was evaluated with trypan blue staining, while apoptosis was assessed by presence of active caspase- 3 and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling of DNA (TUNEL). Results At concentrations in which R 115777, LY 294002 and 17 AAG were only slowing down the proliferation rate, when used separately, the combination of R 115777 ? LY 294002 and R 115777 ? 17 AAG significantly reduced the number of cells and induced cellular apoptosis. Conclusions Our results suggest that the combination of R 115777 ? 17 AAG could be useful in treating some of the hematological malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{ritonavir}} resistance mutations impair HIV infectivity through incomplete Gag processing by the mutant viral protease. Analysis of the {{mutant virus}} phenotype indicates that accumulation of capsid-spacer peptide 1 precursor protein in virus particles impairs HIV infectivity {{and that the}} protease mutant virus is arrested during the early postentry stage of HIV infection before proviral DNA synthesis. However, activation of the target cell can rescue this defect, implying that specific host factors expressed in activated cells can compensate for the defect in ritonavir-resistant HIV. This ability to rescue impaired HIV replication presented {{a unique opportunity to}} identify host factors involved in postentry HIV replication, and we designed a functional genetic screen so that expression of a given host factor extracted from activated T cells would lead directly to its discovery by rescuing mutant virus replication in nonactivated T cells. We identified the cellular heat shock protein 90 kDa α (cytosolic), class B member 1 (HSP 90 AB 1) as a host factor that can rescue impaired replication of ritonavir-resistant HIV. Moreover, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of HSP 90 AB 1 with 17 -(allylamino) - 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin (<b>tanespimycin)</b> has potent in vitro anti-HIV activity and that ritonavir-resistant HIV is hypersensitive to the drug. These results suggest a possible role for HSP 90 AB 1 in postentry HIV replication and may provide an attractive target for therapeutic intervention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lung adenocarcinom (AC) is {{the most}} common form of lung cancer. Currently, the number of medical options to deal with lung cancer is very limited. In this study, we aimed to {{investigate}} potential therapeutic compounds for lung adenocarcinoma based on integrative analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: The candidate therapeutic compounds were identified in a two-step process. First, a meta-analysis of two published microarray data was conducted to obtain a list of 343 differentially expressed genes specific to lung AC. In the next step, expression profiles of these genes were used to query the Connectivity-Map (C-MAP) database to identify a list of compounds whose treatment reverse expression direction in various cancer cells. Several compounds in the categories of HSP 90 inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor, PPAR agonist, PI 3 K inhibitor, passed our screening to be the leading candidates. On top of the list, three HSP 90 inhibitors, i. e. 17 -AAG (also known as <b>tanespimycin),</b> monorden, and alvespimycin, showed significant negative enrichment scores. Cytotoxicity as well as effects on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis were evaluated experimentally in lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A 549 or GLC- 82) with or without treatment with 17 -AAG. In vitro study demonstrated that 17 -AAG alone or in combination with cisplatin (DDP) can significantly inhibit lung adenocarcinoma cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conclusions/Significance: We have used an in silico screening to identify compounds for treating lung cancer. One suc...|$|E
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{an aggressive}} tumor with a poor prognosis. Currently, only sorafenib is {{approved by the}} FDA for advanced HCC treatment; therefore, there is an urgent need to discover candidate therapeutic drugs for HCC. We hypothesized that if a drug signature could reverse, at least in part, the gene expression signature of HCC, it might {{have the potential to}} inhibit HCC-related pathways and thereby treat HCC. To test this hypothesis, we first built an integrative platform, the "Encyclopedia of Hepatocellular Carcinoma genes Online 2 ", dubbed EHCO 2, to systematically collect, organize and compare the publicly available data from HCC studies. The resulting collection includes a total of 4, 020 genes. To systematically query the Connectivity Map (CMap), which includes 6, 100 drug-mediated expression profiles, we further designed various gene signature selection and enrichment methods, including a randomization technique, majority vote, and clique analysis. Subsequently, 28 out of 50 prioritized drugs, including <b>tanespimycin,</b> trichostatin A, thioguanosine, and several anti-psychotic drugs with anti-tumor activities, were validated via MTT cell viability assays and clonogenic assays in HCC cell lines. To accelerate their future clinical use, possibly through drug-repurposing, we selected two well-established drugs to test in mice, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine. Both drugs inhibited orthotopic liver tumor growth. In conclusion, we successfully discovered and validated existing drugs for potential HCC therapeutic use with the pipeline of Connectivity Map analysis and lab verification, thereby suggesting the usefulness of this procedure to accelerate drug repurposing for HCC treatment...|$|E
40|$|HER 2 -positive tumors {{comprise}} 15 % to 20 % of all breast cancers (BC) and {{are associated}} with worse clinical outcomes [Slamon et al. Science 1987; 235 : 177 - 82]. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target the extracellular domain of the HER 2 receptor, and {{is the foundation of}} care of women with early and advanced HER 2 -positive BC. However, a significant proportion of patients with this type of BC display either primary or secondary resistance to trastuzumab. Therefore, in an effort to overcome such resistance and further improve the outcome of patients with HER 2 -positive disease, several new anti-HER 2 agents are currently being developed. These include small molecules that inhibit the HER 2 tyrosine kinase activity (lapatinib, neratinib), monoclonal antibodies directed at other epitopes of the HER 2 extracellular domain (pertuzumab), antibody-drug conjugates (trastuzumab-DMl), and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors (<b>tanespimycin).</b> A great deal of interest has been generated by recent data from the randomized neo-adjuvant studies NeoALTTO and NeoSphere, which have shown that dual blockade of the HER 2 receptor with anti-HER 2 agents is significantly superior to using one agent alone. If these results are validated in larger ongoing and planned phase III studies in early BC, they could lead to a paradigm shift in treatment strategy. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary toxicities and costs, it is critical to intensify the research for biomarkers that can identify those patients most likely to benefit from specific targeted therapies.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{heat shock}} protein 90 (Hsp 90) inhibitors is an {{attractive}} antineoplastic therapy. We wanted to compare {{the effects of the}} benzoquinone 17 -allylamino- 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin (17 -AAG, <b>tanespimycin)</b> and the novel isoxazole resorcinol–based Hsp 90 inhibitor NVP-AUY 922 in a panel of pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma cell lines and in colorectal primary cultures derived from tumors excised to patients. PANC- 1, CFPAC- 1, and Caco- 2 cells were intrinsically resistant to 17 -AAG but sensitive to NVP-AUY 922. Other cellular models were sensitive to both inhibitors. Human epidermal growth factor receptor receptors and their downstream signaling pathways were downregulated in susceptible cellular models, and concurrently, Hsp 70 was induced. Intrinsic resistance to 17 -AAG did not correlate with expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters involved in multidrug resistance. Some 17 -AAG-resistant, NVP-AUY 922 –sensitive cell lines lacked NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1) enzyme and activity. However, colorectal LoVo cells still responded to both drugs in spite of having undetectable levels and activity of NQO 1. Pharmacological and biologic inhibition of NQO 1 did not confer resistance to 17 -AAG in sensitive cell lines. Therefore, even though 17 -AAG sensitivity is related to NQO 1 protein levels and enzymatic activity, the absence of NQO 1 does not necessarily convey resistance to 17 -AAG in these cellular models. Moreover, NVP-AUY 922 does not require NQO 1 for its action and is a more potent inhibitor than 17 -AAG in these cells. More importantly, we show in this report that NVP-AUY 922 potentiates the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine or oxaliplatin, and other drugs that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as antitumor agents...|$|E
40|$|Integrating gene {{expression}} profiles with certain proteins can improve {{our understanding of}} the fundamental mechanisms in protein–ligand binding. This paper spotlights the integration of {{gene expression}} data and target prediction scores, providing insight into mechanism of action (MoA). Compounds are clustered based upon the similarity of their predicted protein targets and each cluster is linked to gene sets using Linear Models for Microarray Data. MLP analysis is used to generate gene sets based upon their biological processes and a qualitative search is performed on the homogeneous target-based compound clusters to identify pathways. Genes and proteins were linked through pathways for 6 of the 8 MCF 7 and 6 of the 11 PC 3 clusters. Three compound clusters are studied; (i) the target-driven cluster involving HSP 90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and <b>tanespimycin</b> induces differential expression for HSP 90 -related genes and overlap with pathway response to unfolded protein. Gene expression results are in agreement with target prediction and pathway annotations add information to enable understanding of MoA. (ii) The antipsychotic cluster shows differential expression for genes LDLR and INSIG- 1 and is predicted to target CYP 2 D 6. Pathway steroid metabolic process links the protein and respective genes, hypothesizing the MoA for antipsychotics. A sub-cluster (verepamil and dexverepamil), although sharing similar protein targets with the antipsychotic drug cluster, has a lower intensity of expression profile on related genes, indicating that this method distinguishes close sub-clusters and suggests differences in their MoA. Lastly, (iii) the thiazolidinediones drug cluster predicted peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, acyl CoA desaturase and significant differential expression of genes ANGPTL 4, FABP 4 and PRKCD. The targets and genes are linked via PPAR signalling pathway and induction of apoptosis, generating a hypothesis for the MoA of thiazolidinediones. Our analysis show one or more underlying MoA for compounds and were well-substantiated with literature...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{promising}} anticancer efficacy observed in preclinical studies, paclitaxel and <b>tanespimycin</b> (17 -AAG) combination therapy has yielded meager responses in a phase I clinical trial. One serious problem associated with paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG combination therapy is {{the employment of}} large quantities of toxic organic surfactants and solvents for drug solubilization. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate a micellar formulation for the concurrent delivery of paclitaxel and 17 -AAG in vivo. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG-loaded micelles were assessed in mice bearing human ovarian tumor xenografts. Compared with the free drugs at equivalent doses, intravenous administration of paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG-loaded micelles led to 3. 5 - and 1. 7 -fold increase in the tumor concentrations of paclitaxel and 17 -AAG, respectively, without significant altering drug levels in normal organs. The enhanced tumor accumulation of the micellar drugs was further confirmed by the whole-body near infrared imaging using indocyanine green-labeled micelles. Subsequently, the anticancer efficacy of paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG-loaded micelles was examined in comparison with the free drugs (weekly 20 mg/kg paclitaxel, twice-weekly 37. 5 mg/kg 17 -AAG). We found that paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG-loaded micelles caused near-complete arrest of tumor growth, whereas the free drug-treated tumors experienced rapid growth shortly after the 3 -week treatment period ended. Furthermore, comparative metabolomic profiling by proton nuclear magnetic resonance revealed significant decrease in glucose, lactate and alanine with simultaneous increase in glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, choline, creatine and acetate levels in the tumors of mice treated with paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG-loaded micelles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have demonstrated in the current wok a safe and efficacious nano-sized formulation for the combined delivery of paclitaxel and 17 -AAG, and uncovered unique metabolomic signatures in the tumor that correlate with the favorable therapeutic response to paclitaxel/ 17 -AAG combination therapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{importance}} of ERBB 2 /NEU/HER 2 in {{the response of}} breast tumours to the heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90) inhibitor 17 -allylamino- 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin (17 -AAG; <b>tanespimycin)</b> has been demonstrated in the clinic. ERBB 2 is an oncoprotein client that is highly dependent on HSP 90. This and other oncogenic client proteins (e. g. B-RAF, C-RAF, ALK and CDK 4) are depleted by 17 -AAG in both animal tumours and patients. Here we investigate by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) the metabolic response of 17 -AAG in spontaneous, NEU/HER 2 driven mammary tumours in transgenic MMTV-NEU-NT mice and in cells isolated and cultured from these tumours. Methods Mammary tumours were monitored by 31 P MRS in vivo and in tumour extracts, comparing control and 17 -AAG treated mice. A cell line derived from NEU/HER 2 mammary tumours was also cultured {{and the effect of}} 17 -AAG was measured by 31 P MRS in cell extracts. Molecular biomarkers were assessed by immunoblotting in extracts from cells and tumours. For comparison of tumour volume, metabolite concentrations and Western blot band intensities, two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used. Results The NEU/HER 2 mammary tumours were very sensitive to 17 -AAG and responded in a dose-dependent manner to 3 daily doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg of 17 -AAG, all of which caused significant regression. At the higher doses, 31 P MRS of tumour extracts showed significant decreases in phosphocholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE) whereas no significant changes were seen at the 20 mg/kg dose. Extracts of isolated cells cultured from the mammary carcinomas showed a significant decrease in viable cell number and total PME after 17 -AAG treatment. Western blots confirmed the expected action of 17 -AAG in inducing HSP 72 and significantly depleting HSP 90 client proteins, including NEU/HER 2 both in tumours and in isolated cells. Conclusions The data demonstrate the high degree of sensitivity of this clinically relevant NEU/HER 2 -driven tumour model to HSP 90 inhibition by 17 -AAG, consistent with the clinical data, and suggest that the metabolic signature of choline phospholipids obtained by MRS could be useful both as a preclinical and clinical tool for investigating surrogate markers of response to treatment. </p...|$|E
