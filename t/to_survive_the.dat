5|$|Clock Tower (1996) is {{the second}} entry in the series and is known in Japan as Clock Tower 2. The game {{released}} for the PlayStation and Kono reprised his role as director.

5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} {{that none of them}} should expect <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> reprisals that would follow the revolt but that the uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change would ever occur.|$|E

5|$|However, the Palladian designs {{advocated}} by Inigo Jones were too {{closely associated with}} the court of Charles I <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> turmoil of the civil war. Following the Stuart restoration Jones's Palladianism was eclipsed by the baroque designs of such architects as William Talman and Sir John Vanbrugh, Nicholas Hawksmoor, and even Jones' pupil John Webb.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and {{in collaboration with}} scientists from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan.

5|$|It was {{originally}} {{known as the}} McKernan Block, after John W. McKernan, the building's original financier, owner, and manager.

5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|Snow affects such human {{activities}} as transportation: creating {{the need for}} keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; such sports as skiing, snowboarding, snowmachine travel; and warfare: impairing target acquisition, degrading the performance of combatants and materiel, and impeding mobility. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> cold.|$|E
25|$|The French were {{interested}} in exploiting the land through the fur trade {{as well as the}} timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in <b>the</b> difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> through <b>the</b> winter; the Indigenous people showed them how <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in <b>the</b> New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.|$|R

5|$|Unlike Gregory, Braham was unperturbed by {{the events}} of 12 May 1944. Braham {{believed}} that while the war continued a trained combat pilot must engage the enemy at all costs.

Braham continued to fly operations deep into enemy airspace over Denmark, alone, and in daylight.|$|E

5|$|A later source, Johannes Aventinus, {{writes that}} Taksony {{fought in the}} Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army. If this report is reliable, Taksony {{was one of the}} few Hungarian leaders <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. Modern historians, {{including}} Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that time. After that battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to retreat from the lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.|$|E
5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> <b>The</b> treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> <b>the</b> divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E
