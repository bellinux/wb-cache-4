60|$|A great {{conflict}} for national existence made necessary, for temporary purposes, {{the raising of}} {{large sums of money}} from whatever source attainable. It made it necessary, in the wisdom of Congress--and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity of the times--to devise a system of national currency which it proved to be impossible to keep {{on a par with the}} recognized currency of the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an extravagance and luxury not required for the happiness or prosperity of a people, and involving, both directly and indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The currency, being of fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculation within itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should be paid in coin, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted--gold or its equivalent. The good faith of <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be violated toward creditors without national disgrace. But our commerce should be encouraged; American shipbuilding and carrying capacity increased; foreign markets sought for products of the soil and manufactories, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a new market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil, the mine, or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle capital and labor to the advantage of the whole people. But, in my judgment, the first step toward accomplishing this object is to secure a currency of fixed, stable value; a currency good wherever civilization reigns; one which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a market with some other; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give to it its value. Gold and silver are now the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the pledges of the American Congress when our present legal-tender system was adopted, and debt contracted, there should be no delay--certainly no unnecessary delay--in fixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and industries until a policy is adopted--with legislation to carry it out--looking to a return to a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of value to them to make so-called money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others. But even these, I believe, would be disappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal-tender medium of exchange. A revival of productive industry is needed by all classes; by none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization upon its sale. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal-tenders to the extent of his liabilities? Than to do this, would it not be safer, for fear of overissues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt obligations are obliterated in the United States, and now we commence anew, each possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? These propositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking or honest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that a convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by positive action by Congress, or by national disasters which will destroy, for a time at least, the credit of the individual and the State at large. A sound currency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of the nation and of individuals. I believe it is in the power of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew confidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career of prosperity to last for many years and to save the credit of the nation and of the people. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this devoutly to be sought for end. There are others which I may touch upon hereafter.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrary}} to a direct intervention approach, where either {{a government agency}} or a private actor (usually a non-profit organization) directly provides a defined target group with a specific service level, self-supply relies on establishing mechanisms to let people decide themselves on the level, the location and {{the timing of the}} service provided. This needs special attention to market development, to strengthening the capacities of the private sector (as a service provider) and government agencies (e.g., as quality monitoring agency). Thus, while not interacting directly with any households, self-supply does not imply that the poorest households and individuals are abandoned, but it optimizes the limited resources available at all levels.

This will be achieved by investigating the formal legislative restraints that land users have to adhere to and by examining the informal links that exist between the rural institutions and the land managers (eg financial, consultancy links). To investigate these formal and informal links it has been necessary to study a major land use issue. The issue selected for the study was land preservation.

However, {{a large part of the}} city – the informal sector – performs much worse. This paper assesses the state of informality in Addis Ababa based on a broad definition, considering informal businesses, employment, housing, land services. We conclude that all households take part in informality as consumers and/or producers, with very high levels of informality in employment, services, land and housing. Informal businesses contribute 26 % of urban employment, with relatively low and decreasing value added per person. The informal sector comprises those in exclusionary informality – where the poor resort to informality as a last resort – and those in voluntary informality – where businesses and households opt for informality based on a cost-benefit analysis. Most informality in Addis Ababa is exclusionary. The small group of businesses and households that are voluntary experience both benefits and costs. With most informality being exclusionary, formalization will not free up hidden reserves and boost the economy. As informal businesses offer services that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> deliver, we discuss incorporating informality into the fabric of the city. Instead of ignoring or controlling informality, formal institutions can work with informal land speculators and businesses – whom have proven to be successful – in offering services and infrastructure...|$|E

Cdk 5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) belongs to CDK family. However, the activator of Cdk 5 is not cyclin, but p 35. The investigation of Cdk 5 was primarily focused on the roles in central nervous system including neurodegenerative diseases. Principle investigator's published results indicate that Cdk 5 can regulate proliferation of both thyroid cancer cells and prostate cancer cells through specific mechanisms. As regards to breast cancer, principle investigator's preliminary results showed the positive correlation between Cdk 5 /p 35 levels and breast cancer cell proliferation (see the preliminary data 3). Clinical data also confirmed that protein levels of Cdk 5 /p 35 in tumor tissues were higher than those in normal ones (patients' specimen was provided from Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital due to collaboration) (see the preliminary data 1 and 2). Therefore, {{the goal of this}} grant is to investigate the roles and mechanisms of Cdk 5 /p 35 which regulate the biological functions of breast cancer cells. The strategies are: 1. Investigate the effects of different Cdk 5 /p 35 levels or activity (includes mutants) on biological functions of breast cancer cells (includes proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, and invasion). 2. Evaluate whether tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, Her 2, and c-Abl, as upstream factors, can directly or indirectly regulate Cdk 5 /p 35 protein expression or activity. 3. Evaluate whether ERα, p 53, p 21 WAP/Cip 1, STAT 3, TC 10 α, c-cbl can be directly or indirectly regulated by Cdk 5 /p 35 as downstream factors (observe transcriptional activity, protein stability, subcellular localization, cytoskeletal change). 4. Take advantage of nude mice xenograft model to testify the hypothetical findings from breast cancer cell lines. 5. Using the commercial tissue array chips of breast cancer (IRB unnecessary) to testify the hypothetical correlation among Cdk 5 /p 35 and those proteins described above. Base on these experimental designs, principle investigator expects to understand the roles of Cdk 5 /p 35 in breast cancer from the view points of basic research and hope these outcomes in the future can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Watershed {{management}} is {{a practice that}} administers water and land resources within a watershed context for different users under spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability. Meeting water demands for both human and ecosystem and maintaining the harmonic balance between those two {{is one of the}} ultimate challenges for watershed managers. This study quantitatively defines both human and natural water users as agents in a watershed and then uses a multi-agent system (MAS) modeling framework to formulate the water allocation issue among the agents. A decentralized optimization algorithm is developed to evaluate the complexity of the watershed level outcomes resulting from different agents??? decisions. The construction of ecology-hydrology quantitative connection is the very first step to incorporate the ecological concern into the watershed planning. A data-mining approach: genetic programming (GP) is applied in this study to addressing this task. Using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHAs) to represent the environmental flow condition, genetic programming generated a quantitative relationship (equation) between natural flow regime metrics (hydrology) and fish community indices (ecology). After a robustness test shows that each metrics in the equation had a consistent relationship with the ecological index, the GP generated equation is proofed as a direct linkage between hydrology and ecology and can reflect the ecosystem status under given flow situation. Meanwhile, the verification test shows a consistent outcome between GP, a traditional statistic method: principal component analysis (PCA) and an ecological approach: autecology matrix (AM). This common outcome provides confidence in using existing and new approaches and observational data to build solid hydroecological relationships. This method is applied to a real world case study regarding using daily reservoir operation for ecosystem restoration purpose. A multi-objectives optimization model is constructed for a case study reservoir in Illinois, USA to evaluate the tradeoff between human economic purpose and ecological conservation purpose. In general, adding the ecological objective into case study reservoir operation will not jeopardize the original economic objective, which is the major concern of current reservoir operation. Meanwhile, the result can also improve the downstream fish habitats by providing a flow regime that close to the natural condition. Due to the spatial heterogeneity involved in the {{management is}}sue, dividing the watershed into interconnected subsystems (agents) should be a more realistic approach for analyzing water resources management problems. Agent can be flexibly defined in any appropriate format to characterize the heterogeneous water usage. Agents in the watershed are different types of water users that include offstream human land and water users and instream water ???users,??? such as riparian aquatic ecosystems. Under the MAS framework, both individual agents??? objectives and the interconnection among these objectives would be addressed using mathematical format. A penalty-based decentralized optimization algorithm is used to solve the formulated mathematical problem. By introducing the local interest factor (??i), this algorithm allows agents to search for the solution in the infeasible solution space when system-wide constraints are violated. The use of ??i values enables the analysis of a water resource management problem to include the impact of the various agent behaviors that ??i values reflect. Aggressive agents with large ??i values affect other agents, particularly the reactive ecosystem agents, and even the entire system. In the real world case study of the Yellow River Basin, China, the concept of ??i has been translated into local water price (pi). The local water price, served as an institutional arrangement, is used to guide the convergence of the decentralized management. The results of different scenarios analysis shows that equilibrium local water prices can be achieved under physical constraints in the watershed that will result in lower water consumptions and higher economic benefits compare to the baseline scenario. The subsidies from <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only guarantee the environmental flow requirement, but also increase the system GDP at the same time. Data limitation is always a major concern for watershed management modeling analysis. The construction of quantitative hydroecological relationship using genetic programming requires long-term fish species data. The utility function for the human water agent also needs actual water consumption and economic benefit data. The modeling results can be further improved if more data become available. Incorporating the concept of uncertainty into the MAS framework is the reasonable next step of this study.

Water scarcity with {{an intrinsic}} geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen.
