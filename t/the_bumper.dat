I told him I was used to going some myself, but it was no go. He said he wouldn't permit me to commit suicide, and I hit the grit. But I nailed her a third time, getting in between on <b>the</b> <b>bumpers.</b> They were <b>the</b> most meagre <b>bumpers</b> I had ever seen--I do not refer to <b>the</b> real <b>bumpers,</b> <b>the</b> iron <b>bumpers</b> that are {{connected}} by the coupling-link and that pound and grind on each other; what I refer to are the beams, like huge cleats, that cross the ends of freight cars just above <b>the</b> <b>bumpers.</b> When one rides <b>the</b> <b>bumpers,</b> he stands on these cleats, one foot on each, <b>the</b> <b>bumpers</b> between his feet and just beneath.|$|R

5|$|Ring's main {{contribution}} to the second Test, at Sydney, which Australia won by seven wickets, came with bat rather than ball. He took only one wicket in a match made controversial by liberal use of <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> by the faster Australian bowlers. But batting at No 9 and joining Lindwall at 372 for seven, just 10 ahead of the West Indies' first innings total, his 65 in 102 minutes helped add 113 before he was ninth out.|$|E
5|$|McMurray and Montoya {{continued}} to lead {{for the next}} three laps, as 14 teams were repairing their cars in the garage after the lap 29 crash. On lap39, Keselowski retook the lead, after having assistance from Regan Smith. Three laps later, Johnson was preparing to return to the race. On lap43, Stewart took the lead one lap before Keselowski retook it from him. On lap 45th, Bowyer became the quickest in the race with a speed of over 200mph. Two laps later, Robert Richardson, Jr. spun off <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> of Travis Kvapil, bringing out yet the fifth caution. He sustained major damage to his car in the accident. Under caution, the leaders made pit stops, giving the first and second positions to Terry Labonte and Dave Blaney at the restart. On lap51, Kurt Busch led before Menard overtook him.|$|E
50|$|To lite the Rebounds planet, players must hit <b>the</b> Pop <b>Bumpers</b> {{a certain}} number of times.

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the lower level tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> blocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} the largest {{repository}} of rail relics in North and South Carolina and averages 80,000 visitors annually. About three-thousand people were employed to repair the trains at the Spencer Shops {{in the first half}} of the twentieth-century. The Flue Shop, where all the flues for steam engines were formerly produced, has become <b>the</b> <b>Bumper</b> To Bumper exhibit, featuring vintage and antique cars. These include: several Model Ts, a Model A, and even a Ford Model R (the 1907 predecessor to the Model T). A Highway Patrol car from 1935, a Divco Milk Truck, a Lincoln Continental and others are also part of the museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} summer came the Bodyline series, when England toured under Douglas Jardine and targeted the upper bodies of the Australian batsmen with short-pitched bowling, using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from the body. In one of the tour matches before the Tests, Fingleton scored a defiant 119*, carrying his bat for New South Wales against <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> barrage of Harold Larwood and Gubby Allen, ensuring his selection for the First Test. Despite his unbending resistance, his state fell to an innings defeat. In a warm-up for the Tests, he scored 29 and 53 not out for an Australian XI against the tourists, while most of his teammates struggled. His earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as Australia were crushed by ten wickets in the First Test in Sydney. Fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times. He then made a defiant four-hour innings to top-score with 83 in the first innings of Australia's only win of the series in the Second Test in Melbourne, although he did run out his batting partner Leo O'Brien in the process. This helped the Australians to reach 228 and they took a 59-run first innings lead before winning the match despite Fingleton making {{only one in the}} second innings. He appeared as well equipped as any Australian to combat England's strategy.|$|E

5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line was {{originally}} planned to extend farther along Hillside Avenue into eastern Queens. The line {{would have gone}} {{at least to the}} intersection of Hillside, Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (the latter two both formerly part of Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to go as far as Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The extension to Springfield Boulevard, which on contract drawings was referred to as Route 108-Section 13, would have been a two track extension of the D3 and D4 express tracks, with five stations, at 187th Street, 197th Street, Cross Island Boulevard (today's Francis Lewis Boulevard), 214th Street, and the terminal at Springfield Boulevard. All of these stations, with the exception of Springfield Boulevard, would have had two side platforms. Hillside Avenue was widened in the 1930s between 218th Street and 229th Street, in order to accommodate construction of the proposed Springfield Boulevard station. As part of the extension of the line to 179th Street in 1950, provisions were made to extend this line farther east via Hillside Avenue. East of the 179th Street there are two four track levels both used as train storage. The upper level was intended to be extended eastward, while the lower level was always intended to be used to relay and store trains. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> blocks. The tracks continue until 184th Street.|$|E
25|$|Pop bumpers are {{operated}} by a switch connected to a ring surrounding the bottom circumference of <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> that is suspended several millimeters above the playfield surface. When the ball rolls over this ring and forces one side of it down, a switch is closed that activates the bumper's solenoid. This pulls down a tapered ring surrounding the central post of <b>the</b> <b>bumper</b> that pushes downward and outward on the ball, propelling it away.|$|E

50|$|Like the American version, <b>the</b> <b>bumpers</b> {{features}} children's {{toys and}} merchandise modeled after classic Hanna-Barbera characters. These bumpers are used on Boomerang in the United States and were animated by Primal Screen. <b>The</b> <b>bumpers</b> were used from launch to February 2005. During this time, Boomerang's programming (which consisted entirely of pre-1980s Hanna-Barbera animation) followed a looping format whereby 8 hours of cartoons were shown everyday between {{the hours of}} 12am and 8am, repeated between the hours of 8am and 4pm, and repeated once more between the hours of 4pm and 12am. The looping format was scrapped in February 2005.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bumpers</b> and trigger buttons were {{overhauled}} {{with a new}} curved {{shape to}} improve their ergonomics, as the user's fingers now naturally lie at an angle upon them unlike the straighter design on Xbox 360 controllers. <b>The</b> <b>bumpers</b> were also made flush with the triggers. The triggers themselves now have a smoother feel, and were made more accurate. Each trigger features independent rumble motors called [...] "Impulse Triggers", which allows developers to program directional vibration. One trigger {{can be made to}} vibrate when firing a gun, or both can work together to create feedback that indicates the direction of an incoming hit.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{the plastic}} band houses {{metallic}} buttons for the volume controls and sleep/wake button. The six holes in <b>the</b> <b>Bumper</b> enable {{access to the}} mute switch, dock connector, headphone jack, speaker, and microphones.|$|E

50|$|As {{discussed}} in detail under Physics, prior to 1959, people believed {{the stronger the}} structure, including <b>the</b> <b>bumpers,</b> <b>the</b> safer the car.
