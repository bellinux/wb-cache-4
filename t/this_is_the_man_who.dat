Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E

The same principles may be applied to vision.|$|R

50|$|According to {{the scholar}} Shane White, English people {{had heard of}} the African Theatre because of British actor and comedian Charles Mathews, so Aldridge {{associated}} himself with that. Bernth Lindfors says:When Aldridge starts appearing on the stage at the Royalty Theatre, he's just called a gentleman of color. But when he moves over to the Royal Coburg, he's advertised in the first playbill as the American Tragedian from the African Theater New York City. The second playbill refers to him as 'The African Tragedian'. So everybody goes to the theater expecting to laugh because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> they think Mathews saw in New York City.|$|R
60|$|The man who hid {{these papers}} in his trunk never {{understood}} {{one word of}} the Persian language, and consequently was liable to every kind of mistake, even though he meant well. But who is this man? Why, it is Captain Williams,--the man who in his affidavits never mentioned the Begums without mentioning Saadut Ali. It is Captain Williams,--whom we charge to have murdered a principal man of the country by his own hand, without law or legal process. It is Captain Williams,--one of those British officers whom Mr. Hastings states to be the pests of the country. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> comes here as evidence against these women, and produces this monstrous paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, they aren't there!" [...] Spencer Wyatt {{announced}} triumphantly. [...] "A {{week ago}} that young fellow came to me. He {{told me what}} was impending.

We are safe, Hebblethwaite! I've been getting wireless messages all day yesterday and to-day. We are at Cromarty and Rosyth. Our torpedo squadron is in position, our submarines are off the German coast.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{six months}} ago, perhaps, {{thought that he}} and Cecil were to rule England together, while all else were the puppets whose wires they pulled. 'The Lord hath taken him up and dashed him down;' and by such means, too, and on such a charge! Betraying his country to Spain! Absurd--incredible--he would laugh it to scorn: but it is bitter earnest. There is no escape. True or false, he sees that his enemies will have his head. It is maddening: a horrible nightmare. He cannot bear it; he cannot face--so he writes to that beloved wife--'the scorn, the taunts, the loss of honour, the cruel words of lawyers.' He stabs himself. Read that letter of his, written after the mad blow had been struck; it is sublime from {{intensity}} of agony. The {{way in which the}} chastisement was taken proves how utterly it was needed, ere that proud, success-swollen, world-entangled heart could be brought right with God.|$|E
50|$|Doop is sent on {{a camping}} trip with Corkscrew. At {{the end he}} simply kills Corkscrew with an axe, but not before {{subjecting}} the mentally unstable mutant to psychological torture. Part of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> tricking <b>the</b> <b>man</b> into killing wild horses.|$|R

6000|$|... 66. As I {{was dreaming}} over this, my eyes fell by chance {{on a page}} of my {{favorite}} thirteenth century psalter, just where two dragons, one with red legs, and another with green,--one with a blue tail on a purple ground, {{and the other with}} a rosy tail on a golden ground, follow the verse [...] "Quis ascendet in montem Domini," [...] and begin the solemn [...] "Qui non accepit in vano animam suam." [...] Who hath not lift up his soul unto vanity, we have it; and [Greek: elaben epi mataiô], the Greeks (not that I know what that means accurately): broadly, they all mean, [...] "who has not received nor given his soul in vain," [...] <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> can make haste, even uphill, the only haste worth making; and it must be up the right hill, too: not that Corinthian Acropolis, of which, I suppose, the white specter stood eighteen hundred feet high, in Hades, for Sisyphus to roll his fantastic stone up--image, himself, forever of the greater part of our wise mortal work.|$|E
6000|$|Notice that well-to-do {{stockbroker}} crawling {{about on}} his stomach in the underbrush, with his spectacles shining like gig-lamps. What is he doing? He is after a cariboo that isn't there. He is [...] "stalking" [...] it. With his stomach. Of course, away down in his heart {{he knows that the}} cariboo isn't there and never was; but that man read my pamphlet and went crazy. He can't help it: he's GOT to stalk something. Mark him as he crawls along; see him crawl through a thimbleberry bush (very quietly so that the cariboo won't hear the noise of the prickles going into him), then through a bee's nest, gently and slowly, so that the cariboo will not take fright when the bees are stinging him. Sheer woodcraft! Yes, mark him. Mark him any way you like. Go up behind him and paint a blue cross on the seat of his pants as he crawls. He'll never notice. He thinks he's a hunting dog. Yet <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> laughs at his little son of ten for crawling round under the dining-room table with a mat over his shoulders, and pretending to be a bear.|$|E
6000|$|... § 17. How far Turner {{followed}} it, is {{not easily}} shown; for his finish is so delicate as to be nearly uncopiable. I have just {{said it was not}} possible to finish that ash trunk of his, farther, on such a scale.[42] By using a magnifying-glass, and giving the same help to the spectator, it might perhaps be possible to add and exhibit a few more details; but even as it is, I cannot by line engraving express all that there is in that piece of tree-trunk, on the same scale. I have therefore magnified the upper part of it in fig 4. (Plate 5.), so that the reader may better see the beautiful lines of curvature into which even its slightest shades and spots are cast. Every quarter of an inch in Turner's drawings will bear magnifying in the same way; much of the finer work in them can hardly be traced, except by the keenest sight, until it is magnified. In his painting of Ivy Bridge,[43] the veins are drawn on the wings of a butterfly, not above three lines in diameter; and in one of his smaller drawings of Scarborough, in my own possession, the muscle-shells on the beach are rounded, and some shown as shut, some as open, though none are as large as one of the letters of this type; and yet <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was thought to belong to the [...] "dashing" [...] school, literally because most people had not patience or delicacy of sight enough to trace his endless detail.|$|E
50|$|Cowles' first book, {{published}} in early 1941, Looking For Trouble, details both her {{experiences in the}} war, and the small community of foreign war correspondents that developed there, which included Hemingway, Gelhorn and others who {{would go on to}} cover World War II. Cowles wrote the book to convey her belief that America should enter World War II. She included in it her telling account of claustrophobia at a Nuremberg Rally, and her experience of Hitler's diminishment as he left the stand:”his small figure suddenly became drab and unimpressive.

60|$|The madman is not he that {{defies the}} world. The saint, the criminal, the martyr, the cynic, the nihilist may all defy the world quite sanely. And even if such fanatics {{would destroy the}} world, the world owes them a {{strictly}} fair trial according to proof and public law. But the madman is not the man who defies the world; {{he is the man}} who denies it. Suppose we are all standing round a field and looking at a tree in the middle of it. It is perfectly true that we all see it (as the decadents say) in infinitely different aspects: that is not the point; the point is that we all say it is a tree. Suppose, if you will, that we are all poets, which seems improbable; so that each of us could turn his aspect into a vivid image distinct from a tree. Suppose one says it looks like a green cloud and another like a green fountain, and a third like a green dragon and the fourth like a green cheese. The fact remains: that they all say it looks like these things. It is a tree. Nor are any of the poets in the least mad because of any opinions they may form, however frenzied, about the functions or future of the tree. A conservative poet may wish to clip the tree; a revolutionary poet may wish to burn it. An optimist poet may want to make it a Christmas tree and hang candles on it. A pessimist poet may want to hang himself on it. None of these are mad, because they are all talking about the same thing. But there is another man who is talking horribly about something else. There is a monstrous exception to mankind. Why he is so we know not; a new theory says it is heredity; an older theory says it is devils. But in any case, the spirit of it is the spirit that denies, the spirit that really denies realities. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> looks at the tree and does not say it looks like a lion, but says that it is a lamp-post.|$|E

Henry had, by this time, attended two day schools and he now enrolled as a weekly boarder at Friends' School, Grove House, Tottenham. It was here that he met his first mentor, Mr. Ashford, a master at the school. Head described Ashford as [...] "one of the best teachers of natural science I have ever encountered."
