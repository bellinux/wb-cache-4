Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef.

Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized that something was wrong and decided to head to the bridge. However, when he got to the door of his cabin, the combination <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window.

25|$|Alan Davidson {{came down}} from the {{pavilion}} end like a man possessed and bowled with great pace, far more than his controlled fast-medium. David Sheppard was caught in front of the wicket lbw for 0, Ted Dexter's off-stump was missed by a coat of varnish and Geoff Pullar was bowled through the gate. Colin Cowdrey came in at 19/2, but with bags of confidence after hitting 307 (with 4 sixes and 29 fours) against South Australia, his highest first-class score and the best by a tourist in Australia. Together Dexter and Cowdrey withstood Davidson's burst of speed, the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Occasionally Dexter would strike out {{and at the end of}} a long, hot day he gave Bobby Simpson a catch of Benaud (1/82) and was out for 93, his third missed century in three innings. The stand had made 175 runs and the unluckiest bowler was Norm O'Neill (0/19) who had Cowdrey dropped on 56 and dropped a hard-hit return from Dexter on 89. Cowdrey ended the day on 94 not out with Ken Barrington on 11, England 210/3 - still 106 runs behind - and the game very much in the balance. They returned the next day and Cowdrey made his third and highest century in Australia, having made 102 in Melbourne in 1954-55 and 100 not out in Sydney in 1958-59. The celebrations were short lived when Cowdrey (113) hooked into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie, who then had Barrington (35) was lbw to a ball that cut back. Tom Graveney might have given England a real lead, but his was run out by a cracking throw from Neil Harvey for 41 and the last 4 wickets fell for 16 runs as Davidson (6/75) returned the clean up the tail; Fred Titmus caught behind, Fred Trueman skying the ball to O'Neill, Brian Statham having his stumps <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> Len Coldwell edging to Benaud in the gully. Alan Smith was left 6 not out and England were out for 331, a lead of 15 runs when they had looked set for far more, or far worse.|$|E

However flight tests did reveal blast gas ingestion when firing in a sideslip by the engine on the side opposite the sideslip. Several solutions were evaluated to cure the problem, but Ilyushin pushed for the more radical solution of extending the air intakes for the engines {{all the way to the}} nose of the aircraft and moving the guns to the bottom of the nose, behind the air intakes.|$|E

2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E
