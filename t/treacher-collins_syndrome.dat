40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obstructive sleep apnoea {{syndrome}} (OSAS) is {{a highly}} prevalent disorder associated with reduced {{quality of life and}} adverse cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae. Recent years have seen an intensification of the research effort to establish the genetic contribution to the development of OSAS and its sequelae. This review explores emerging evidence in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: A genetic basis for sleep-disordered breathing has been demonstrated for discrete disorders such as <b>Treacher-Collins</b> and Down <b>syndromes,</b> but the picture is less clear in so-called idiopathic OSAS. A degree of heritability appears likely in some of the intermediate phenotypes that lead to OSAS, particularly craniofacial morphology. However, only sparse and often contradictory evidence exists regarding the role of specific polymorphisms in causing OSAS in the general population. Similarly, investigations of the cardiovascular sequelae of OSAS have in general failed to consistently find single causative genetic mutations. Nonetheless, evidence suggests a role for tumour necrosis factor-alpha polymorphisms in particular, and large-scale family studies have suggested shared pathogenetic pathways for the development of obesity and OSAS. SUMMARY: As with other common disorders, OSAS is likely to result from multiple gene-gene interactions occurring in a suitable environment. The application of modern genetic investigative techniques, such as genome-wide association studies, may facilitate new discoveries in this field...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nager {{syndrome}} is a malformation resulting from {{problems in the}} development of the first and second branchial arches and limb buds. The cause of the abnormal development of the pharyngeal arches in Nager {{syndrome is}} unknown. It is also unclear why affected individuals have bone abnormalities in their arms and legs. Nager syndrome is thought to have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern when unaffected parents have more than one affected child. The purpose of this report is to present a case of Nager syndrome where the patient exhibited upper limb shortening, an unusual feature that has been reported as coexisting in some individuals with Nager syndrome.  Case report: A 3. 5 -year-old girl was referred to our Department of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology due to a cleft palate. Her craniofacial anomalies included malar hypoplasia, severe mandibular hypoplasia with retrognathia, downward slanted palpebral fissures, a high narrow hard palate, absent soft palate, small retroplaced tongue, bilateral external auditory canal atresia, and dysplastic ears. There was no evidence of mental retardation. Based on the craniofacial characteristics and the coexisting upper limb preaxial anomalies, a diagnosis of Nager syndrome was confirmed.  Conclusion: Nager syndrome is a rare disorder resulting from developmental abnormalities of the first and second branchial arches. It is linked to five other similar syndromes: Miller <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Treacher-Collins,</b> Pierre-Robin, Genee-Wiedemann, and Franceschetti-Zwahlen-Klein. Multidisciplinary management by a craniofacial team is needed. Early intervention, intensive education, new surgical techniques, and an emphasis on coordinated care have improved the quality of life in this patient with Nager syndrome...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{zebrafish}} pharyngeal cartilage {{is derived}} from the pharyngeal apparatus, a vertebrate-specific structure derived from all three germ layers. Developmental aberrations of the pharyngeal apparatus lead to birth defects such as <b>Treacher-Collins</b> and DiGeorge <b>syndromes.</b> While interactions between endoderm and neural crest (NC) are known to be important for cartilage formation, the full complement of molecular players involved and their roles remain to be elucidated. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule a (alcama), a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, is among the prominent markers of pharyngeal pouch endoderm, but to date no role has been assigned to this adhesion molecule {{in the development of the}} pharyngeal apparatus. Here we show that alcama plays a crucial, non-autonomous role in pharyngeal endoderm during zebrafish cartilage morphogenesis. alcama knockdown leads to defects in NC differentiation, without affecting NC specification or migration. These defects are reminiscent of the phenotypes observed when Endothelin 1 (Edn 1) signaling, a key regulator of cartilage development is disrupted. Using gene expression analysis and rescue experiments we show that Alcama functions downstream of Edn 1 signaling to regulate NC differentiation and cartilage morphogenesis. In addition, we also identify a role for neural adhesion molecule 1. 1 (nadl 1. 1), a known interacting partner of Alcama expressed in neural crest, in NC differentiation. Our data shows that nadl 1. 1 is required for alcama rescue of NC differentiation in edn 1 −/− mutants and that Alcama interacts with Nadl 1. 1 during chondrogenesis. Collectively our results support a model by which Alcama on the endoderm interacts with Nadl 1. 1 on NC to mediate Edn 1 signaling and NC differentiation during chondrogenesis...|$|R
50|$|More than 120 {{mutations}} in the TCOF gene {{have been identified}} in people with <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Most of these {{mutations in}}sert or delete a small number of DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TCOF1 gene. TCOF1 mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of treacle or prevent the cell from producing this protein. Researchers speculate that a loss of treacle reduces the production of rRNA in parts of the embryo that develop into facial bones and tissues. It is not known how loss of the treacle protein causes the specific problems with facial development found in Treacher Collins syndrome. For instance, mutations in the TCOF gene of these individuals often result in a cleft palate.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by craniofacial malformations, narrowing of {{the external auditory canal}} (EAC), and, in 30 % of cases, agenesis of the canal and ossicular chain defects. The use of hearing aids (HA) is not possible in cases in which agenesis or stenosis of the EAC accompanies conductive deafness. In contrast, bone conduction implants such as the Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA®) allow direct stimulation of the cochlea and are thus superior to conventional hearing aids in cases of severe conductive hearing loss. Objective: To present 2 cases of patients with <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> who underwent implantation of BAHA®. Cases Reports: The first patient was a 52 -year-old woman diagnosed with <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> who presented with severe bilateral mixed hearing loss and a history of unsuccessful previous use of a bone contact conduction device. The BAHA® implantation was uneventful, and the post-operative results were good. The second patient was a 14 -year-old girl who was also diagnosed with <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>Syndrome</b> with bilateral moderate conductive hearing loss by audiometry. The use of a bone vibrator contact device did not improve her hearing; however, implantation of a BAHA® resulted in a decreased gap postoperatively. Final comments: BAHA® hearing devices provide adequate rehabilitation and consequent improvement of {{the quality of life in}} patients with <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{congenital}} craniofacial disorder {{with multiple}} anomalies. This syndrome affects the maxilla, mandible, eyes, middle and outer ears, and soft palate. Conductive hearing loss {{due to the}} deformities of the middle and external ears is prevalent. The characteristics of this syndrome include multiple and serious threats to normal communication development in children. In this study, speech and language features of a Persian speaking child with this syndrome are presented. Case: The case was an 8 -year old girl with <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> and bilateral moderate conductive hearing loss due to atretic canal. In language and speech assessments, moderate hypernasality, numerous compensatory errors and morphosyntactic deficits were observed. There were 13 phonemes that were incorrectly produced at least in one position. Besides, she used 22 types of phonological processes that were abnormal and disappear {{before the age of}} three in normal Persian speaking children. Conclusion: Moderate hearing loss, velopharyngeal incompetency, malocclusion and dental anomalies, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and environmental factors resulted in severe speech and language disorders in this case. These disorders affected her academic performance as well. Moderate hypernasality, numerous compensatory errors, and excessive and abnormal use of phonological processes were not presented as prevalent characteristics of <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> in other resources...|$|E
40|$|<b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant craniofacial disorder which affects approximately 1 in 50, 000 live births.

30|$|Aplasia of the {{salivary glands}} {{is a rare}} {{condition}} that usually affects the parotid and submandibular glands. Single or multiple glands may be absent or hypoplastic. Exact aetiology remains unknown; however, the condition {{has been attributed to}} first and second branchial arch abnormalities. Specifically, it has been associated with genetic syndromes involving craniofacial development such as <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome,</b> hemifacial microsomia and lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome [3]. Some studies report increased incidence in trisomy 21 [4]. Although usually discovered incidentally on imaging, some cases are identified when patients present with dry mouth, dysphagia and dental disease. Imaging may show compensatory hypertrophy of other major salivary glands, and therefore {{it is important not to}} mistake normal gland tissue for other lesions such as tumour [5].|$|E

All patients had some abnormality. Vision loss was present in 37 % of patients. Amblyopia was present in 33 %, significant refractive errors were present in 58 %, and anisometropia was documented in 17 %. Strabismus was present in 37 % and significant lid and adnexal abnormalities were seen in 96 %.

Although the distraction could be considered a success in that it enabled permanent decannulation and improved the minimum cross-sectional area of the upper airway, there was no further increase in the minimum cross-sectional area of the upper airway during childhood growth. It is significant that the abnormal growth pattern of the mandible, which is characteristic of this syndrome, did not alter from its preoperative pattern once distraction was completed. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Orofacial clefting is genetically complex, {{no single}} gene being {{responsible}} for all forms. It can, however, result from a single gene defect either {{as part of a}} syndrome (e. g. van der Woude syndrome, <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome,</b> velo-cardio-facial syndrome) or as an isolated phenotypic effect (e. g. X-linked cleft palate; non-syndromic, autosomal dominant orofacial clefting). Several studies have suggested that chromosome 6 p is a candidate region for a locus involved in orofacial clefting. We have used YAC clones from contigs in 6 p 25 -p 23 to investigate three unrelated cases of cleft lip and palate coincident with chromosome 6 p abnormalities. Case 1 has bilateral cleft lip and palate and a balanced translocation reported as 46,XY,t(6, 7) (p 23;q 36. 1). Case 2 has multiple abnormalities including cleft lip and palate and was reported as 46,XX,del(6) (p 23;pter). Case 3 has bilateral cleft lip and palate and carries a balanced translocation reported as 46,XX,t(6; 9) (p 23;q 22. 3). We have identified two YAC clones, both of which cross the breakpoint in cases 1 and 3 and are deleted in case 2. These clones map to 6 p 24. 3 and therefore suggest the presence of a locus for orofacial clefting in this region. The HGP 22 and AP 2 genes, potentially involved in face formation, have been found to flank this region, while F 13 A maps further telomeric in 6 p 24. 3 / 25...|$|E
40|$|During {{vertebrate}} craniofacial development, {{neural crest}} cells (NCCs) contribute {{to most of}} the craniofacial pharyngeal skeleton. Defects in NCC specification, migration and differentiation resulting in malformations in the craniofacial complex are associated with human craniofacial disorders including <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> caused by mutations in TCOF 1. It has been hypothesized that perturbed ribosome biogenesis and resulting p 53 mediated neuroepithelial apoptosis results in NCC hypoplasia in mouse Tcof 1 mutants. However, the underlying mechanisms linking ribosome biogenesis and NCC development remain poorly understood. Here we report a new zebrafish mutant, fantome (fan), which harbors a point mutation and predicted premature stop codon in zebrafish wdr 43, the ortholog to yeast UTP 5. Although wdr 43 mRNA is widely expressed during early zebrafish development, and its deficiency triggers early neural, eye, heart and pharyngeal arch defects, later defects appear fairly restricted to NCC derived craniofacial cartilages. Here we show that the C-terminus of Wdr 43, which is absent in fan mutant protein, is both necessary and sufficient to mediate its nucleolar localization and protein interactions in metazoans. We demonstrate that Wdr 43 functions in ribosome biogenesis, and that defects observed in fan mutants are mediated by a p 53 dependent pathway. Finally, we show that proper localization of a variety of nucleolar proteins, including TCOF 1, is dependent on that of WDR 43. Together, our findings provide new insight into roles for Wdr 4...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tessier {{described}} rare craniofacial clefts anatomically. The no. 7 cleft is {{a lateral}} facial cleft consisting of macrostomia, lateral facial muscular diastasis, and bony abnormalities of the maxilla and zygoma. Early computed tomographic imaging provided preliminary {{insight into the}} bony abnormality. This article reviews this patient group, defining the clinical and radiological features, to advise optimal protocol management. Methods: A retrospective case-note review of 15 patients with Tessier no. 7 clefts managed by the Australian Craniofacial Unit over the past 25 years was performed. Cases of hemifacial microsomia and <b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> were excluded. Clinical features of the patient group were analyzed with photography (all clefts) and imaging (seven clefts). Surgical management and outcome are reviewed. Results: Fifteen patients and 18 clefts (three bilateral) were treated during the time period of the study. All patients had macrostomia (mean length, 2 cm) and 94 percent had soft-tissue ridging from muscular diastasis directed toward the tragus (44 percent), temporal area (28 percent), or lateral canthus (22 percent). Bony abnormalities included simple clefting of the maxillary molar region in 55 percent, maxillary duplication in 39 percent, and intermaxillary fusion in 6 percent. Surgical intervention included macrostomia repair at the first available opportunity, resection of maxillary duplication (median age, 4 years), and alveolar bone grafting to the cleft (median age, 10 years). Optimal follow-up of these patients is impaired because of long distances required for review. Patients treated with this management protocol have had good functional and aesthetic results to date. Conclusions: This article describes the Tessier no. 7 cleft in great detail and suggests a new subclassification of the bony abnormality. An adjusted management protocol is proposed to address the bony abnormalities of cleft and duplication, with favorable outcomes for treated patients with this condition.

40|$|A migra????o ?? o fator evolutivo capaz de dispersar a diversidade gen??tica entre popula????es, inserindo novas caracter??sticas fenot??picas e genot??picas. A din??mica matrimonial, juntamente como a estrutura da popula????o s??o fatores que podem alterar a frequ??ncia destas caracter??sticas. Exemplo dessas caracter??sticas s??o as doen??as gen??ticas, onde a frequ??ncia e distribui????o destas auxilia na compreens??o da influ??ncia de fatores evolutivos em uma popula????o. No munic??pio de Monte Santo, localizado no {{interior}} da Bahia, foram encontradas doen??as gen??ticas com elevada frequ??ncia, como mucopolissacaridose do tipo VI e fenilceton??ria. Existem evid??ncias que algumas doen??as mostram associa????o entre a ra??a e o risco de sua ocorr??ncia. Dados moleculares mostraram que na Bahia a contribui????o africana ?? de 47, 2 %, entretanto, dados baseados em classifica????o fenot??pica apontam para o aumento da contribui????o europeia com o afastamento do litoral. Para inferir a origem de algumas doen??as gen??ticas em Monte Santo foram analisados marcadores informativos de ancestralidade autoss??micos (AT 3 -I/D, APO, PV 92 e SB 19. 3 genotipados por PCR; GC* 1 F e GC* 1 S por PCR/RFLP; e os marcadores FYnull, CKMM e LPL por PCR em tempo real) e marcadores uniparentais do mtDNA (sequenciamento da regi??o HVS-I) e do cromossomo Y (marcador YAP por PCR; DYS 199, 92 R 7 e M 207 por PCR/RFLP; e M 60, PN 2, PN 3, M 34, M 89, M 9 por sequenciamento). Assim, atrav??s da identifica????o da origem desses marcadores foi poss??vel inferir a contribui????o das popula????es que formaram a popula????o de Monte Santo, e a origem de algumas das altera????es g??nicas respons??veis pelas doen??as gen??ticas aqui estudadas (s??ndrome de Treacher Collins, hipotireoidismo cong??nito, fenilceton??ria, mucopolissacaridose tipo VI, surdez heredit??ria n??o sindr??mica e osteog??nese imperfeita). Os dados do cromossomo Y e dos autoss??micos apontam para maior contribui????o europeia, e os resultados dos marcadores mitocondriais para elevada contribui????o africana e amer??ndia. A elevada contribui????o europeia tanto paterna quanto autoss??mica sugere origem europeia para as muta????es c. 35 delG e R 252 W, respons??veis por aproximadamente 24 % dos casos de surdez heredit??ria n??o sindr??mica e por todos os casos de fenilceton??ria, respectivamente. A mucopolissacaridose do tipo VI tem como causa a muta????o p. H 178 L, a presen??a desta altera????o apenas em pacientes brasileiros, que compartilham o mesmo hapl??tipo intrag??nico sugere origem aut??ctone. Al??m de marcadores moleculares tamb??m foram analisados os tipos de casamentos (endog??micos, exog??micos e entre imigrantes) e sua frequ??ncia no munic??pio. Foi observada elevada frequ??ncia de casamentos endog??micos e baixa taxa de migra????o, sugerindo crescimento populacional interno. Al??m disso, a maioria da popula????o reside em povoados, cujo tamanho varia de 113 a 582 pessoas por povoado. Nesta cidade 80 % da popula????o tem renda mensal equivalente a meio sal??rio m??nimo, o que explica a baixa taxa de migra????o por aus??ncia de atrativos econ??micos. Avaliando os casamentos dentro das genealogias dos afetados ?? poss??vel observar que a maioria deles ?? filho de pais consangu??neos. Estes resultados mostram que o elevado grau de endogamia e endocruzamento assim como poss??vel efeito fundador e deriva gen??tica est??o associados ao aumento da frequ??ncia e manuten????o das doen??as gen??ticas neste munic??pio. Migration is {{the evolutionary}} factor able to disperse the genetic diversity among populations, inserting new phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. The dynamic {{of marriage and}} population structure are factors that may maintain or eliminate these characteristics. Examples of these traits are genetic diseases, where the frequency of these helps in understanding the evolutionary factors influence in a population. In Monte Santo city, situated in county of Bahia, were found genetic diseases with high frequency such as mucopolysaccharidosis type VI and phenylketonuria. It {{has been shown that}} some diseases have an important racial factor in determining risk of its occurrence. Molecular results show that in Bahia the African contribution is 47. 2 %. However, phenotypic classification data show an increase of European contribution with the distance from the coast. To infer the origin of some genetic disease in Monte Santo were analyzed autosomal ancestry informative markers (AT 3 -I/D, APO, PV 92 and SB 19. 3 genotyped by PCR, GC* 1 F and GC* 1 S by PCR/RFLP and FYnull, CKMM and LPL genotyped by real time PCR) and uniparental markers of mtDNA (sequencing of the HVS-I region) and the Y chromosome (YAP marker by PCR; DYS 199, 92 R 7 and M 207 by PCR/RFLP, and M 60, PN 2, PN 3, M 34, M 89, M 9 by sequencing). Thus, by identifying the origin of these markers was possible to infer the contribution of the populations that formed Monte Santo, and the origin of some genetic mutations responsible for genetic diseases studied here (<b>Treacher-Collins</b> <b>syndrome,</b> congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, hereditary non-syndromic deafness and osteogenesis imperfecta). The Y chromosome and autosomal results indicate greater European contribution, and the results from mtDNA show high contribution of African and Amerindian contribution. The high European contribution both paternal and autosomal suggests European origin for the c. 35 delG and R 252 W mutations, responsible for approximately 24 % of cases of hereditary non-syndromic deafness and all phenylketonuria cases, respectively. The mucopolysaccharidosis type VI is caused by p. H 178 L mutation, the presence of this mutation only in Brazilian patients, who share the same intragenic haplotype suggest an autochthonous origin. In addition to molecular markers were also analyzed the types of marriages (endogamic, exogamous and between immigrant) and how often they occur in the city. We observed a high frequency of endogamic marriages and low migration rates, suggesting internal population growth. The population of Monte Santo is characterized by division into villages, where the majority of the population, the number of inhabitants varies from 113 to 582 people per village. In this city 80 % of the population has income equivalent to half the minimum wage, which reinforces the absence of compelling economic and low migration rate. Evaluating the marriages inside the genetic diseases pedigree families can be observed that most of those affected are children of consanguineous parents. These results suggest that the high degree of inbreeding as well as the occurrence of founder effect and genetic drift were associated with increased frequency and maintenance of genetic diseases in the city...|$|E
