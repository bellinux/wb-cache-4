40|$|<b>Tilorone</b> {{hydrochloride}} characteristically induces {{an unusually}} delayed and prolonged interferon response not {{commonly associated with}} other synthetic inducers. Maximum circulating interferon levels of 8, 000 to 10, 000 units/ml were detected 12 hr postinoculation and persisted for up to 30 hr after administration of <b>tilorone.</b> The fact that both oral and intraperitoneal injections of <b>tilorone</b> induce a similar response suggests that this delay {{is not based on}} the time required for adsorption from the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro, <b>tilorone</b> failed to induce detectable levels of interferon in either mouse peritoneal lymphocyte or macrophage cell cultures. Furthermore, interferon production could not be detected in the upper gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of <b>tilorone.</b> The striking suppression of interferon production in X-irradiated mice suggested that lymphatic tissue may be a source of interferon in response to <b>tilorone.</b> This concept was not supported, however, by experiments utilizing antilymphocyte serum (ALS). <b>Tilorone</b> induced comparable levels of interferon in both ALS-treated and control animals which had received normal serum, even though the ALS-treated mice had decreased spleen weights and peripheral lymphocyte counts. These data suggest that a radiosensitive cell population other than lymphocytes may be an important factor in the capacity of the host to produce interferon in response to <b>tilorone.</b> Mice which received repeated injections of <b>tilorone</b> developed a severe state of hyporeactivity. The degree of hyporeactivity was particularly striking when compared to that induced by polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid and emphasizes one of the major obstacles confronting interferon inducers as chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tilorone</b> (2, 7 -bis[2 -(diethylamino) ethoxy]-fluoren- 9 -one) {{and several}} other bis-basic {{compounds}} are known to induce lysosomal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage. The responsible pathomechanism has not been elucidated yet. The assumption of an unspecific disturbance of lysosomal proenzyme targeting due to elevation of endosomal pH is opposed by the hypothesis of formation of a complex between <b>tilorone</b> and GAGs within the lysosomes, which renders GAGs indigestible to glycosidases. In cultures of bovine corneal fibroblasts the amounts of intracellular GAGs [dermatan sulphate (DS), heparan sulphate (HS) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) ] were quantified. The fibroblasts were exposed to <b>tilorone</b> (5 microM), which {{was found to be}} readily taken up by the cells and to be accumulated within acidic compartments to finally achieve millimolar concentrations. Under these conditions the GAG storage is predominantly due to the accumulation of DS; however, the DS secretion into the culture medium was not affected. The HS accumulation was much less pronounced, accounting only for 3 % of total GAG storage. Ammonium chloride (10 mM), which is known to diminish lysosomal enzyme activity by interfering with the mannose 6 -phosphate receptor-mediated transport, prevents both HS and DS breakdown. By means of NMR spectroscopy it was shown that <b>tilorone</b> itself tends to display a concentration-dependent aggregation which was enhanced in the presence of GAGs. The diethylamino groups of <b>tilorone</b> interact physicochemically with DS, and to a smaller extent with HS, but not with chondroitin 4 -sulphate. Thus, the strength of the interaction between <b>tilorone</b> and the different GAGs in vitro correlates with the potency of <b>tilorone</b> to inhibit the breakdown of the individual GAGs in cultured bovine fibroblasts. The results support the hypothesis of a specific interaction between <b>tilorone</b> and particular GAGs, rendering these resistant to enzymic degradation...|$|E

We investigated the effects of immunostimulants (LPS, dextran sulfate and <b>tilorone)</b> on biotransformation and macrophage activities in carp. The major effect of LPS was its capacity to inhibit 3 -MC-induced cytochrome P 450 activities in the liver and head kidney.

40|$|The {{immunomodulatory}} agent <b>tilorone</b> - 2, 7 -bis-[2 -(diethyl-amino) ethoxy]fluoren- 9 -one- and congeners are potent inducers of lysosomal {{storage of}} sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in animals and cultured fibroblasts {{of animals and}} man. All potent inducers of GAG storage hitherto described are bisbasic polycyclic aromatic compounds. They are accumulated in lysosomes and disturb the degradation of GAGs, mainly dermatan sulphate. It has been proposed that the drugs cross-link the polyanionic GAG chains giving rise to undergradable drug-GAG complexes. This hypothesis implies that the bisbasic character of the drug molecules {{is essential for the}} side effect in question. In the present study, this was tested by comparing <b>tilorone</b> and its monobasic derivative (MT) with respect to (i) induction of GAG storage in cultured bovine corneal fibroblasts and (ii) physicochemical interactions with GAGs in vitro. The intralysosomal concentration of MT achieved after 1 - 3 days was of the same order of magnitude as previously shown for <b>tilorone.</b> Nevertheless, under conditions that did not enhance the secretion of a lysosomal enzyme (beta-hexosaminidase, EC 3. 2. 1. 52), the ability of MT to cause storage of [35 S]GAGs was significantly lower than that of <b>tilorone.</b> Morphological observations showed that MT was much more potent in causing lysosomal storage of polar lipids than of GAGs. CD spectroscopy with <b>tilorone</b> revealed that the presence of GAGs caused the primarily achiral drug molecules to display CD. This suggested a helical orientation of the <b>tilorone</b> molecules within GAG-drug complexes, and short intermolecular distances which allowed electronic coupling of the aromatic ring systems of adjacent drug molecules. In contrast, MT failed to display any induced optical activity, indicating the absence of highly ordered GAG-drug complexes. In conclusion, the present results show that the substitution of the planar aromatic ring system with two basic side chains is essential for the high potency of <b>tilorone</b> in inducing lysosomal GAG storage. This is paralleled by, and presumably causally related to, strong physicochemical interactions with GAGs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK 5) is a {{potential}} target for prostate cancer treatment, the enzyme being essen-tial for prostate tumor growth and formation of metastases. In the present study, we identified agents that target prostate cancer cells based on CDK 5 expression. CDK 5 activity was suppressed by transfection of PC 3 prostate cancer cells with a dominant-negative construct (PC 3 CDK 5 dn). PC 3 CDK 5 dn and PC 3 control cells were screened for compounds that selec-tively target cells based on CDK 5 expression, utilizing the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. MTS proliferation, clonogenic and 3 D growth assays were performed to validate the selected hits. Screening of 3, 360 compounds identified rutilantin, ethacridine lactate and cetalkonium chloride as compounds that selectively target PC 3 control cells and a <b>tilorone</b> analog as a selective inhibitor of PC 3 CDK 5 dn cells.

In mice receiving combination therapy, autoantibody responses were not suppressed. Nevertheless, glomerulonephritis was controlled partially and the mean lifespan was prolonged to 82 weeks. Eighteen neoplasms appeared in ten mice in the combination treatment group, and five mice had more than one neoplasm. The appearance of lymphomas was delayed in mice receiving two drugs. It was concluded that concurrent therapy with <b>tilorone</b> stimulated autoantibody production and altered the expected pattern of neoplasia in cyclophosphamide-treated NZB/NZW mice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Imiquimod {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potent antiviral and antitumor agent in animal models. The bio-logical activity associated with imiquimod has been at-tributed to its induction of interferon (IFN) -a. The pres-ent studies evaluated imiquimod administered orally for its ability to stimulate production of IFN and other cyto-kines in mice. The cytokine profile induced by imiquimod was compared with other known immunomodulators. Imiquimod was found to stimulate increased serum IFN in mice. Daily dosing of imiquimod for five consecutive days led to diminished production of IFN in mice as mea-sured after the final dose. Elevated levels of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a and interleukin (IL) - 6 but not IL-la were found in serum from mice treated with imi-quimod. Imiquimod produced significantly higher levels of IFN but lower levels of TNF and IL- 6 and IL-la than lipopolysaccharide. Polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid induced significantly higher amounts of IFN but lower levels of TNF and IL- 6 than imiquimod. Imiquimod stimulated significantly higher levels of IFN when com-pared with 2 -amino- 5 -bromo- 6 -phenyl- 4 (3 H) -pyrimidi-none (ABPP) and similar levels of IFN when compared with <b>tilorone.</b> Neither ABPP nor <b>tilorone</b> induced TNF or IL- 6. Finally, imiquimod stimulated TNF, IFN, and IL- 6 production in cultures of mouse spleen and bone marrow cells. These studies demonstrate that imiquimod induces not only IFN but other cytokines as well, all of which may contribute to its biological activity. J. Leukoc...|$|E
40|$|Female BDF 1 mice {{were exposed}} to lead acetate in the {{drinking}} water at concentrations ranging form 0 to 1000 micrograms/mL lead for three weeks. The mice tolerated these levels of lead exposure without exhibiting signs of clinical toxicity. Weight gains were not affected by lead exposure. The production of viral interferon induced by the oral administration of <b>tilorone</b> was not altered by lead exposure. The T-lymphocyte mitogens concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and staphylococcal enterotoxin A induced immune interferon to varying degrees, with concanavalin A and staphylococcal enterotoxin A exhibiting the most potent induction capabilities. The production of immune interferon induced by T-lymphocyte mitogens was not suppressed by lead exposure...|$|E
