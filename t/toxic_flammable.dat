25|$|One of the {{simplest}} arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly <b>toxic,</b> <b>flammable,</b> pyrophoric arsine (AsH3). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300°C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid. Several factors, such as humidity, presence of light and certain catalysts (namely aluminium) facilitate the rate of decomposition. It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with sulfur and selenium instead of oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} is an organochloride {{with the}} formula H2C=CHCl {{that is also}} called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) or chloroethene. This colorless compound is an important industrial chemical chiefly used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). About 13 billion kilograms are produced annually. VCM is among the top twenty largest petrochemicals (petroleum-derived chemicals) in world production. The United States currently remains the largest VCM manufacturing region because of its low-production-cost position in chlorine and ethylene raw materials. China is also a large manufacturer {{and one of the}} largest consumers of VCM. Vinyl chloride is a gas with a sweet odor. It is highly <b>toxic,</b> <b>flammable,</b> and carcinogenic. It can be formed in the environment when soil organisms break down [...] "chlorinated" [...] solvents. Vinyl chloride that is released by industries or formed by the breakdown of other chlorinated chemicals can enter the air and drinking water supplies. Vinyl chloride is a common contaminant found near landfills. In the past VCM {{has been used as a}} refrigerant.|$|E

25|$|A popular {{choice of}} working fluid is ammonia, which has {{superior}} transport properties, easy availability, and low cost. Ammonia, however, is <b>toxic</b> and <b>flammable.</b> Fluorinated carbons such as CFCs and HCFCs are not <b>toxic</b> or <b>flammable,</b> but {{they contribute to}} ozone layer depletion. Hydrocarbons too are good candidates, but they are highly flammable; in addition, this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels. The power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid. With increasing vapor pressure, {{the size of the}} turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side.|$|R

50|$|Re-gripping used {{to require}} <b>toxic,</b> <b>flammable</b> {{solvents}} to soften and activate the adhesive, and a vise {{to hold the}} club steady while the grip was forced on. The newest replacement kits, however, use double-sided tape with a water-activated adhesive that is slippery when first activated, allowing easier installation. Once the adhesive cures, it creates a very strong bond between grip and shaft and the grip is usually impossible to remove without cutting it off.|$|E
50|$|Inorganic and semiorganic {{polymers}} often employ silicon-nitrogen, boron-nitrogen, and phosphorus-nitrogen monomers. The non-burning {{characteristics of}} the inorganic components of these polymers contribute to their controlled flammability. For example, instead of forming <b>toxic,</b> <b>flammable</b> gasses in abundance, polymers prepared with incorporation of cyclotriphosphazene rings give a high char yield upon combustion. Polysialates (polymers containing frameworks of aluminum, oxygen, and silicon) are another type of inorganic polymer that can be thermally stable up to temperatures of 1300-1400 °C.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, air {{conditioning}} and refrigeration systems employed compounds such as ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), propane, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as refrigerants. Though effective, these were <b>toxic,</b> <b>flammable</b> or explosive and, {{in the event of}} leakage, could result in serious illness, injury or even death. The Frigidaire division of General Motors, at that time a leading manufacturer of such systems, sought a non-toxic, non-flammable alternative to these refrigerants. Kettering, the vice president of General Motors Research Corporation at that time, assembled a team that included Midgley and Albert Leon Henne to develop such a compound.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{dating back}} to the {{discovery}} of the drug, the Nagai route did not become popular among illicit manufacturers until 1982, and comprised 20% of production in Michigan in 2002. It involves red phosphorus and hydrogen iodide (also known as hydroiodic acid or iohydroic acid). (The hydrogen iodide is replaced by iodine and water in the [...] "Moscow route".) The hydrogen iodide is used to reduce either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. On heating, the precursor is rapidly iodinated by the hydrogen iodide to form iodoephedrine. The phosphorus assists in the second step, by consuming iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (which decomposes in water to phosphorous acid, regenerating hydrogen iodide). Because hydrogen iodide exists in a chemical equilibrium with iodine and hydrogen, the phosphorus reaction shifts the balance toward hydrogen production when iodine is consumed (see Le Châtelier's principle). In Australia, criminal groups have been known to substitute [...] "red" [...] phosphorus with either hypophosphorous acid or phosphorous acid (the [...] "Hypo route"). This is a hazardous process for amateur chemists because phosphine gas, a side-product from in situ hydrogen iodide production, is extremely toxic to inhale. The reaction can also create <b>toxic,</b> <b>flammable</b> white phosphorus waste. Methamphetamine produced in this way is usually more than 95% pure.|$|E
