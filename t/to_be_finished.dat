5|$|In Ship Harbour {{citizens}} were isolated for 5 days until a temporary road was made. Also in Spaniard's Bay, the flooding caused {{a bridge to}} depress about 1.5feet (50cm); a temporary bridge was built within two months, with a permanent replacement scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> {{by the summer of}} 2008. Insured damage across the area totaled $25million (2007CAD, $24.3million 2007USD).|$|E

5|$|US 206 was widened in Byram Township to six lanes. This {{construction}} {{follows a}} decade of controversy, including concerns that the widening would violate the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act passed in 2004; an exemption to this act allowed the construction to proceed.

5|$|Development {{work on the}} CFM56 began before CFMI was {{formally}} created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished.</b>|$|E

The northbound lanes of this segment were closed on April7, and one direction of the segment was closed until November. It fully reopened on December3 along with the West Main Street–Allen Street segment. Rehabilitation of Broad Street from West Main Street to Exchange Boulevard {{was expected to be}} completed in mid-to-late 2011. The entire project, which also calls for landscape improvements to the area surrounding West Broad Street, was tentatively scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> in February 2012.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, NY9A was {{extended}} {{south to the}} Battery Tunnel by way of 12th Avenue and two other streets the Elevated Highway had previously run atop of, West Street and 11th Avenue. Construction began in early 1996 on a project to convert the section of NY9A south of 59th Street into the West Side Highway, a six-lane urban boulevard with a parkway-style median and decorative lightposts. The first of the project's seven segments—between Clarkson and Horatio streets in the Greenwich Village neighborhood—was completed in 1998. Completion {{of the project was}} originally set for October 2001; however, it was delayed for years due to damage caused by the September 11 attacks. It is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> by the end of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of the pope, and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E
5|$|NJDOT {{started the}} I-287 (Middlesex Freeway) Rehabilitation Project in August 2007 to {{resurface}} the pavement between exit5 in South Plainfield and I-95/New Jersey Turnpike in Edison Township, {{which is used}} by about 150,000 vehicles daily. Some of the bridges and overpasses had deteriorated to such a state {{that they needed to}} be replaced. On September16, 2009, NJDOT announced the start of another rehabilitation and repaving project from exit5 in Piscataway to the area of exit10 in Franklin Township. This project, which is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is to cost $29 million and is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> later in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Production {{returned}} in late April to Hong Kong, {{and also to}} Macau, for that island {{is famous for its}} casinos, which Hong Kong lacks. Some scenes in Thailand had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished,</b> and production had to move to studio work in Pinewood Studios; this included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior. Academy Award winner Oswald Morris was hired to finish the job after cinematographer Ted Moore became ill. Morris was initially reluctant, as he did not like his previous experiences taking over other cinematographers' work, but accepted after dining with Broccoli. Production wrapped in Pinewood in August 1974.|$|E
5|$|There were {{no changes}} in the front line after January 21 {{as a result of}} Operation Iskra. The Soviet forces were unable to advance any further, and instead started fortifying the area to thwart any German attempt at re-establishing the blockade. On January 22, work started on the rail line linking Leningrad {{to the rest of the}} country through the {{captured}} corridor. The plan from the GKO written on January 18, ordered the construction <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> in 20 days. The work was completed ahead of schedule and trains began delivering supplies on February 6, 1943. The operation officially ended on January 30.|$|E
5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>finished</b> by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators will be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E
