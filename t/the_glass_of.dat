25|$|The {{club has}} always been noted for its wealthy members, grand banquets and boisterous rituals, such as vandalising ('trashing') of {{restaurants}} and college rooms, complemented by a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. Its ostentatious display of wealth attracts controversy, since many ex-members have moved up to high political posts, most notably former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour. Infamously on 12 May 1894, after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> the lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building, and again on 20 February 1927.

25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E

500|$|... "A Benihana Christmas" [...] was {{directed}} by Harold Ramis and written by Jennifer Celotta. It was produced by Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais, Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman. The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, different actresses were used because Andy and Michael failed {{to pick up the}} original waitresses, and settled for [...] "less attractive ones". At Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the joke failed due to poor casting. The waitresses that come to the office were supposed to be unattractive. Daniels stated that the actresses they hired for the role were [...] "too good-looking". During filming, John Krasinski threw a shrimp across the table at Rainn Wilson.

500|$|The {{window on}} the north wall of the nave is {{to the east of}} the door, and was added in the 19th century.

[...] The second window in the transept, in the east wall, is from the 19th century. The two windows in the south transept, in the south and east walls, are both from the 17th century, and are square-headed with two lights. The window in the east wall of the chancel is from the 19th-century and has three lights topped with stonework trefoils.

500|$|The {{main event}} from the Raw brand was the Elimination Chamber {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The match began with Jericho and Michaels in the ring, while Goldberg, Nash, Orton, and Triple H were locked in the chambers. Michaels and Jericho wrestled, with neither of them gaining the {{advantage}} over the other. Orton and Nash were {{the third and fourth}} entrants into the match, respectively. Nash was the first wrestler eliminated from the match after Michaels executed a superkick and Chris Jericho covered him for a pinfall. Triple H and Goldberg were the fifth and sixth entrants. Michaels performed another superkick on Triple H as soon as he exited his chamber, and as a result, Triple H was knocked back into his chamber. As soon as Goldberg entered the match, he performed a spear for a pinfall to eliminate Orton. Next, Goldberg performed a Jackhammer on Michaels and Jericho, eliminating both via pinfall. This left Goldberg alone with and Triple H, who at the time had remained inside the chamber. Goldberg performed a spear on him through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> the chamber, in the process pushing him out of the chamber. Ric Flair, who was managing both Triple H and Orton, then handed [...] Triple H a sledgehammer. Goldberg attempted another spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg with the sledgehammer and covered him for the pinfall, thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Triple H, Orton and Flair viciously attacked Goldberg, ending with Triple H busting Goldberg open by repeatedly hitting him in the head with his sledgehammer.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{moved to}} Warner Bros. Studios' Stage 16 {{to shoot the}} T. rex attack on the LSX powered SUVs. Shooting proved {{frustrating}} because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic T. rex to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with shammys between takes. On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would get scared and run away. The ripples in <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water caused by the T. rexs footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth, Wind and Fire in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put {{a glass of water}} on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect. Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the Dilophosaurus on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center. Spielberg changed the climax to bring back the T. rex, abandoning the original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws. The scene which already had the juxtaposition of live dinosaurs in a museum filled with fossils, while also destroying the bones, now also had an ending where the T. rex saved the protagonists, and afterwards did what Spielberg described as a [...] "King Kong roar" [...] while an ironic banner reading [...] "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" [...] flew. The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30, and within days, editor Michael Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming Schindler's List.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{physical}} sciences, a phase is {{a region of}} space (a thermodynamic system), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform. Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air over the water is a third phase. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> the jar is another separate phase. (See state of matter#Glass) ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{thermodynamic}} system, {{differences in}} pressure, density, and temperature all tend to equalize over time. For example, consider a room containing {{a glass of}} melting ice as one system. The difference in temperature between the warm room and the cold glass of ice and water is equalized as heat from the room is transferred to the cooler ice and water mixture. Over time {{the temperature of the}} glass and its contents and the temperature of the room achieve balance. The entropy of the room has decreased. However, the entropy of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the room has decreased. In an isolated system, such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler regions always results in a net increase in entropy. [...] Thus, when the system of the room and ice water system has reached temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at its maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.|$|E
2500|$|Beuys's {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} {{in a private}} gallery opened on 26 November 1965 {{with one of the}} artist's most famous and compelling performances: How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare. The artist could be viewed through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> the gallery's window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear he mumbled muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings that lined the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described [...] "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," [...] though Beuys disagreed with the description.|$|E
