There are developed the separate schemes for DC motor starting and braking regimes {{by using the}} supercapacitor energy saving devices for motor armature shunting. The starting device allows to decrease the motor <b>torque</b> <b>jerks</b> {{at the beginning of}} transient process thus providing the elimination of consumed energy and drive system mechanical wear. There is given the saved energy calculating equivalent circuit and expression. By varying the subtitution scheme shunting and ballast resistance values, the mechanical time constant changes with increasing the speed of transient processes. The estimated DC motor control device with supercapacitor battery allows to eliminate the need for ballast resistor. The decreasing of consumed energy is achieved in such way because the electrodynamic braking has realized simultaneosly with shunting of DC motor armature with the help of capacitor energy saver which decreases the armature voltage to provide the stable boost converter operation. The braking scheme with two converters transfers the energy saved in the filter capacitor to the supercapacitor energy saver independently from the filter capacitor voltage oscillation value.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two problems}} requiring vibration suppression, one following thruster firing for orbit adjustment, {{and the other}} following minimum time rest-to-rest slewing by control moment gyros. Solution to the first problem is basically a new application of the well-known three-impulse sequence for robust vibration suppression. For the second problem, a torque-time profile is assumed with limits on maximum <b>torque</b> and <b>jerk</b> and unknown switching times at the corners. These unknowns are determined by solving a minimization problem subject to the constraints of zero residual vibration, zero sensitivity to modeling error, and the terminal slewing conditions. Open loop results show significant reduction of vibrations...|$|R
40|$|Finding the Time-Optimal Parameterization of a Path (TOPP) {{subject to}} second-order {{constraints}} (e. g. acceleration, torque, contact stability, etc.) {{is an important}} and well-studied problem in robotics. In comparison, TOPP subject to third-order constraints (e. g. <b>jerk,</b> <b>torque</b> rate, etc.) has received far less attention and remains largely open. In this paper, we investigate {{the structure of the}} TOPP problem with third-order constraints. In particular, we identify two major difficulties: (i) how to smoothly connect optimal profiles, and (ii) how to address singularities, which stop profile integration prematurely. We propose a new algorithm, TOPP 3, which addresses these two difficulties and thereby constitutes an important milestone towards an efficient computational solution to TOPP with third-order constraints.

40|$|In {{machining}} complex dies, molds, aerospace and automotive parts, or biomedical components, it {{is crucial}} to minimize the cycle time, which reduces costs, while preserving the quality and tolerance integrity of the part being produced. To meet the demands for high quality finishes and low production costs in machining parts with complex geometry, computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools must be equipped with spline interpolation, feedrate modulation, and feedrate optimization capabilities. This thesis presents the development of novel trajectory generation algorithms for Non Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) toolpaths that can be implemented on new low-cost CNC's, as well as, in conjunction with existing CNC's. In order to minimize feedrate fluctuations during the interpolation of NURBS toolpaths, the concept of the feed correction polynomial is applied. Feedrate fluctuations are reduced from around 40 % for natural interpolation to 0. 1 % for interpolation with feed correction. Excessive acceleration and jerk in the axes are also avoided. To generate jerk-limited feed motion profiles for long segmented toolpaths, a generalized framework for feedrate modulation, based on the S-curve function, is presented. Kinematic compatibility conditions are derived to ensure that the position, velocity, and acceleration profiles are continuous and that the jerk is limited in all axes. This framework serves as the foundation for the proposed heuristic feedrate optimization strategy in this thesis. Using analytically derived kinematic compatibility equations and an efficient bisection search algorithm, the command feedrate for each segment is maximized. Feasible solutions must satisfy the optimization constraints on the velocity, control signal (i. e. actuation <b>torque),</b> and <b>jerk</b> in each axis throughout the trajectory. The maximized feedrates are used to generate near-optimal feed profiles that have shorter cycle times, approximately 13 - 26 % faster than the feed profiles obtained using the worst-case curvature approach, which is widely used in industrial CNC interpolators. The effectiveness of the NURBS interpolation, feedrate modulation and feedrate optimization techniques has been verified in 3 -axis machining experiments of a biomedical implant...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{a method}} is {{presented}} to construct minimum-time robot trajectories for predefined Cartesian end-effector path in a workspace containing obstacles. The method is preferably applied to a geometric collision-free path of a SCARA robot by using the theories of Bezier, B-spline, and parabolic blending curves. The motion of the manipulator is defined by Cartesian control points and represented by a sequence of generated Cartesian knots along the end-effector path which is transformed into sets of joint displacements with one set for each joint. Cubic spline functions are then used to fit the sequence of joint displacements for each joint. The minimum-time trajectory planning problem is formulated as the problem of minimizing the total traveling time subject to constraints on joint positions, velocities, accelerations, <b>jerks,</b> <b>torques</b> and end-effector acceleration. The modified pattern search goal programming method is proposed to solve this nonlinear optimization problem. The computer program, ROBOPATH, has been written to implement the algorithm for a manipulator with two links and two degrees of freedom. The examples show the algorithm to be a useful tool {{in the design of}} manipulators, robot tasks and workcells. The results show that different locations of a path and different path shapes resulted in different total traveling times. Also, as a result, approximation curve techniques gave shorter total traveling time than the interpolation curve technique...|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} {{unclear whether the}} brain plans movement kinematics explicitly or whether movement paths arise implicitly through optimization of a cost function {{that takes into account}} control and/or dynamic variables. Several cost functions are proposed in the literature that are very different in nature (e. g., control effort, <b>torque</b> change, and <b>jerk),</b> yet each can predict common movement characteristics. We set out to disentangle predictions of the different variables using a combination of modeling and empirical studies. Subjects performed goal-directed arm movements in a force field (FF) in combination with visual perturbations of seen hand position. This FF was designed to have distinct optimal movements for muscle-input and dynamic costs while leaving kinematic cost unchanged. Visual perturbations in turn changed the kinematic cost but left the dynamic and muscle-input costs unchanged. An optimally controlled, physiologically realistic arm model was used to predict movements under the various cost variables. Experimental results were not consistent with a cost function containing any of the control and dynamic costs investigated. Movement patterns of all experimental conditions were adequately predicted by a kinematic cost function comprising both visually and somatosensory perceived jerk. The present study provides clear behavioral evidence that the brain solves kinematic and mechanical redundancy in separate steps: in a first step, movement kinematics are planned; and in a second, separate step, muscle activation patterns are generated...|$|R
40|$|We {{permanently}} {{deal with}} gravity force. Experimental evidences revealed that moving against gravity strongly differs from moving along the gravity vector. This directional asymmetry has {{been attributed to}} an optimal planning process that optimizes gravity force effects to minimize energy. Yet, only few studies have considered the case of vertical movements in the context of optimal control. What kind of cost is better suited to explain kinematic patterns in the vertical plane? Here, we aimed to understand further how the central nervous system (CNS) plans and controls vertical arm movements. Our reasoning was the following: if the CNS optimizes gravity mechanical effects on the moving limbs, kinematic patterns should change according to the direction and the magnitude of the gravity torque being encountered in the motion. Ten subjects carried out single-joint movements, i. e., rotation around the shoulder (whole arm), elbow (forearm), and wrist (hand) joints, in the vertical plane. Joint kinematics were analyzed and compared with various theoretical optimal model predictions (minimum absolute work-jerk, <b>jerk,</b> <b>torque</b> change, and variance). We found both direction-dependent and joint-dependent variations in several kinematic parameters. Notably, directional asymmetries decreased according to a proximodistal gradient. Numerical simulations revealed that our experimental findings could be attributed to an optimal motor planning (minimum absolute work-jerk) that integrates the direction and the magnitude of gravity torque and minimizes the absolute work of forces (energy-related cost) around each joint.

40|$|Robots are {{becoming}} more and more involved in our daily life. In order to increase the acceptance of modern robotics in society even further, quite some improvements in human-robot interaction have to be made. Non-verbal communication is one such way of conveying information between robots and humans. In spite of its great potential, the current state of research is fairly limited. The goal of this research is to create a control framework that could generate movements with the flexibility to convey information by adapting the movement trajectories. Other studies have mainly researched non-verbal interaction using an optimized feedforward controller. Humans are however able to move without learning all movement sequences in advance, which is the motivation to solely focus on feedback controlled motions in current research. Considering the motion metrics traveled path, electrical power, gravitational <b>torque</b> and end-effector <b>jerk,</b> the proportional-derivative controller in the workspace proves to be best capable of producing the most human-like motions. The control framework for communicating non-verbally consists of an Operational Space Control hierarchy, combining the aforementioned controller and a novel method minimizing the gravitational torque during movement. Furthermore, human-likeness is even further increased by imposing joint limits based on the human extremes. These limits cause potential local minima, which prevent the controller from reaching the desired final position. Introducing an extra, unusual coordinate helps overcoming these minima taking into consideration the angle between current and final position. With these components included, the framework is able to reach any desired location taking into consideration human-likeness and maximum joint angle constraints. The Labanotation is used to describe the different motions to be conducted, the same way as is done with human dancing motions. Combining this representation with the Laban Time, Space and Weight Effort, it is now possible to conduct different movements. Professional dancers were asked to participate in an experiment, resulting in the relation between the end-effector trajectories and the Laban Basic Efforts: dab, flick, float and glide. These trajectories were used to optimize the gains within the control framework. The procedure was run for different initial and final desired positions, resulting in four sets of control gains corresponding to each of the four Efforts. Different motions are obtained using the four different control sets. Simulation shows that direct and flexible motions (Space Effort) are distinguishable by the shortest trajectories opposed to longer traveling distances respectively. High gravitational torque gains and low spring and damping gains result in more flexible motions. Furthermore, sustained and sudden motions (Time Effort) differ by the time the end-effector needs to reach the desired position. Sudden motions show to have higher spring-damping ratios with respect to sustained motions. In summary, the general control framework proposed by this thesis has the flexibility to generate motions either using the dabbing, flicking, floating or gliding Effort and therefore contributes to the acceptance of robots in society.
