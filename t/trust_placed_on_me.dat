It is with that sense I am writing this note {{at the end of my}} work contract with Supélec. One of the best things that ever happened in my life is to have an opportunity to pursue my doctoral research at Supélec and work with two great minds in the form of Prof. Olivier Pietquin and Dr. Matthieu Geist. Things got even better when I registered my thesis at the Université d’Avignon and continued working under the guidance of Prof. Fabrice Lefèvre. Between 2009 and 2012, I had numerous opportunities to interact with them and learn a great deal of things. I am really grateful for having received their unlimited support at good times as well as those difficult days. I wish to convey my deepest gratitude to my advisers for their priceless time, efforts and above all their inspiration. Olivier, the <b>trust</b> you <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> was more than what I had on myself at times...|$|R

For example, {{to decide whether to}} trust a cloud service provider, a cloud user may simply just check whether the provider passed the formal audit of a widely accepted cloud service policy, conducted by a trusted auditor.|$|R

30|$|Reputation is {{typically}} {{represented by a}} comprehensive score reflecting the overall opinion, or {{a small number of}} scores on several major aspects of performance. It is unrealistic to ask a large number of cloud users to rate a cloud service or service provider against a large set of complex and fine-grained criteria. The reputation of a cloud service provider reflects the overall view of a community towards that provider, therefore it is more useful for the cloud users (mostly individual users) in choosing a cloud service from many options without particular requirements. Reputation may be helpful when initially choosing a service, but is inadequate afterwards. In particular, as a user gains experience with the service, the <b>trust</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> that service meeting performance or reliability requirements will evolve based on that experience.|$|R

40|$|As social {{networking}} sites proliferate across the World Wide Web, complex user-created HTML content is rapidly becoming the norm rather than the exception. User-created web content is a notorious vector for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that target websites and confidential user data. In this threat climate, mechanisms that render web applications immune to XSS attacks have been of recent research interest. A challenge for these security mechanisms is enabling web applications to accept complex HTML input from users, while disallowing malicious script content. This challenge is made difficult by anomalous web browser behaviors, which are often used as vectors for successful XSS attacks. Motivated by this problem, we present a new XSS defense strategy designed {{to be effective in}} widely deployed existing web browsers, despite anomalous browser behavior. Our approach seeks to minimize <b>trust</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> browsers for interpreting untrusted content. We implemented this approach in a tool called BLUEPRINT that was integrated with several popular web applications. We evaluated BLUEPRINT against a barrage of stress tests that demonstrate strong resistance to attacks, excellent compatibility with web browsers and reasonable performance overheads. 1...|$|R
