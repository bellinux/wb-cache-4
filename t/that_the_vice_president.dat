25|$|Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>{{president}}</b> becomes president {{upon the}} removal from office, death, or {{resignation of the}} preceding president. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 provides that if the offices of President and Vice President are each either vacant or are held by a disabled person, the next officer in the presidential line of succession, the Speaker of the House, becomes acting president. The line then extends to the President pro tempore of the Senate, followed by {{every member of the}} Cabinet. A person must fulfill all eligibility requirements of the office of President to be eligible to become acting president; ineligible individuals are skipped.|$|E
500|$|Rangel again {{expressed}} his displeasure {{with the vice}} president in October 2006 – after Cheney had said that [...] "Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works" [...] – by opining that Cheney is [...] "a real son of a bitch" [...] who [...] "enjoys a confrontation", and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. [...] The White House said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a [...] "big hearty laugh" [...] over them.|$|E
500|$|Agnew thus {{put into}} words {{feelings}} that many Republicans and conservatives had long felt about the news media. Television network executives and commentators responded with outrage. Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an [...] "appeal to prejudice... it is regrettable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press". Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments.|$|E

500|$|On October 18, 2005, The Washington Post {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president's</b> {{office was}} central to {{the investigation of the}} Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis [...] "Scooter" [...] Libby, was one of the figures under investigation.|$|R

500|$|Should the Vice President and a {{majority}} of the Cabinet believe the President is still [...] "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office", they may within four days of the President's declaration submit another declaration that the President is incapacitated. If not already in session, the Congress must then assemble within 48 hours. The Congress has 21 days to decide the issue. If within the 21 days two-thirds of each house of Congress vote that the President is incapacitated, the Vice President would [...] "continue" [...] to be Acting President. Should the Congress resolve the issue in favor of the President, or make no decision within the 21 days allotted, then the President would [...] "resume" [...] discharging the powers and duties of his office. The use of the words [...] "continue" [...] and [...] "resume" [...] imply <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> remains Acting President while Congress deliberates.|$|E
500|$|In 1841, President William Henry Harrison {{became the}} first U.S. President to die in office. Representative John Williams had {{previously}} suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> should become Acting President upon {{the death of the}} President. John Tyler asserted that he had succeeded to the presidency, as opposed to only obtaining its powers and duties. He also declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as [...] "Acting President". Although he felt his vice presidential oath negated the need for the presidential oath, Tyler was persuaded that being formally sworn-in would clear up any doubts about his right to the office. Having done so, he then moved into the White House and assumed full presidential powers. Tyler's claim was not formally challenged, and both houses of Congress adopted a resolution confirming that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States, without any qualifiers. The precedent of full succession was thus established. This became known as the [...] "Tyler Precedent".|$|E
500|$|As the {{campaign}} got underway, Humphrey tried to position {{himself as the}} conservative Democrat in the race, hoping to appeal to Southern delegates. Republicans, feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> may be the nominee, began to attack him, describing his positions as socialistic and reminding voters that Southern Democrats once considered him a [...] "wild-eyed liberal." [...] Democrats conceded this point but argued that compared to McCarthy and Kennedy, Humphrey was conservative. He immediately made {{an impact on the}} polls, rocketing to number one among Democrats in the beginning of May with 38%, ahead of both McCarthy and Kennedy. An internal struggle within {{the campaign}} between the new politics of Mondale and Harris, and the old politics of Connell, Kampelman and Maguire, sometimes disrupted the organization of staffers in different states. Humphrey ordered Connell to not circumvent Mondale and Harris on campaign decisions, but the clashing continued throughout the campaign. The older faction referred to Mondale and Harris as [...] "boy scouts".|$|E

500|$|Investigative {{reporters and}} Democratic {{operatives}} had pursued rumors that Agnew had been corrupt {{during his years}} as a Maryland official, but they {{had not been able to}} substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew heard of the investigation and had Attorney General Richard Kleindienst contact Beall. The vice president's personal attorney, George White, visited Beall, who stated that Agnew was not under investigation, and that prosecutors would do their best to protect Agnew's name. In June, Matz's attorney disclosed to Beall that his client could show that Agnew not only had been corrupt, but that payments to him had continued into his vice presidency. These later payments would not be barred by the statute of limitations; Agnew could be prosecuted. On July 3, Beall informed the new Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and at the end of the month Nixon, through his chief of staff, Alexander Haig, was informed. Agnew had already met with both Nixon and Haig to assert his innocence. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew's attorney, formally advising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> was under investigation for tax fraud and corruption. Matz was prepared to testify that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in cash. Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland's road commission, had extensive documentation that detailed, as Beall put it, [...] "every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew".|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{had spent}} the four months between the {{election}} and swearing-in being feted by the New York Whigs and winding up affairs in the comptroller's office. Taylor had written promising influence in the new administration, but the president-elect mistakenly thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> was a cabinet member, which was not true in the 19th century. Fillmore, Seward and Weed had met and come to general agreement on how to divide federal jobs in New York. Seward, once he went to Washington, made friendly contact with Taylor's cabinet nominees, advisers, and the general's brother, and an alliance between the incoming administration and the Weed machine was soon under way behind Fillmore's back. [...] In exchange for support, Seward and Weed were allowed to designate who would fill federal jobs in New York, with Fillmore given far less than had been agreed. When Fillmore, after the inauguration, discovered this, he went to Taylor, but the only result was that the warfare against Fillmore's influence became open. Fillmore supporters like Collier, who had nominated him at the convention, were passed over for candidates backed by Weed, who was triumphant even in Buffalo. This greatly increased the influence of Weed in New York politics, and diminished Fillmore's. According to Rayback, [...] "by mid-1849, Fillmore's situation had become desperate." [...] Despite his lack of influence, he was pestered by office seekers and those seeking to lease or sell a house to him, as there was then no official residence for the vice president. [...] He enjoyed one aspect of his office, due to his lifelong love of learning: he became {{deeply involved in the}} administration of the Smithsonian Institution as a member ex officio of its Board of Regents.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times, Wolf denied ever advising Gore on his wardrobe.

When serving in this capacity, the Vice President, who is not a member of the Senate, may cast tie-breaking votes. [...] Early in the nation's history, Vice Presidents frequently presided over the Senate.

50|$|Hamilton notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{selection}} of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> should follow <b>the</b> same form as <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> president, through selection by the Electoral College, though the Senate is {{to deal with}} the voting {{in the case of an}} Electoral tie. Hamilton also answers criticism <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senate should have been given the power to select <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> instead of <b>the</b> Electoral College. Hamilton notes that there are two major arguments against that point: first, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president's</b> power as President of the Senate would mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tiebreaker of the Senate would be beholden to the Senate for his power, and therefore would be unable to make the necessary decisions as a tiebreaker without fear of removal or reprisal; second, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> possibility of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> becoming president means that this individual should be elected by the people and the Electoral College, because all of the powers vested in the president could fall into the hands of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Wilkerson made {{comments}} in November 2005 {{to the effect}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> had decided that the Third Geneva Convention (regarding treatment of POWs) would not apply to [...] "al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda look-alike detainees" [...] and that the February 2002 White House memorandum regarding the [...] "Humane Treatment of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees" [...] contained a loophole designed to avoid applying the Geneva convention to the detainees. According to Wilkerson, the phrase [...] "the detainees (should) be treated humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, {{in a manner consistent}} with the principles of Geneva" [...] was a way to appear to play by the rules while in reality, the [...] "military necessities" [...] would always overrule concerns about the plight of the detainees. Wilkerson said that this was result of Cheney and Rumsfeld working in collaboration to undermine the standard decision-making process of the White House (which included his superior, Colin Powell).|$|E

[...] Although he was often a guest at the White House, Stevenson admitted that he was less {{an adviser to the}} president than [...] "the neighbor to his counsels." [...] He credited the President with being [...] "courteous at all times" [...] but noted that [...] "no guards were necessary to the preservation of his dignity. No one would have thought of undue familiarity." [...] For his part, President Cleveland snorted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> had surrounded himself with a coterie of free-silver men dubbed the [...] "Stevenson cabinet."
