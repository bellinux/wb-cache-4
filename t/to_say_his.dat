5|$|The first {{studies of}} the Javan {{rhinoceros}} by naturalists from outside of its region took place in 1787, when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls {{were sent to the}} renowned Dutch naturalist Petrus Camper, who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan rhinoceros was shot on the island of Sumatra by Alfred Duvaucel, who sent the specimen to his stepfather Georges Cuvier, the famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest as Rhinoceros sondaicus. It was the last species of rhinoceros to be identified. Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> specimen was from Java.|$|E

25|$|Dr Bainbridge of St Martin's Lane and Surgeon Lawrence {{attended}} {{him at the}} Angel Tavern {{and debated}} whether his leg should be amputated. When told he would lose his leg at the hip, Mynn, a sincerely religious man, asked {{for a few minutes}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> prayers. In those minutes the doctors decided not to operate and instead had him sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After two years convalescence, he fully recovered.|$|E

25|$|In December 1944, Karl Leisner, a deacon from Münster who {{was dying}} of {{tuberculosis}} received his ordination at Dachau. Gabriel Piguet, Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand {{had arrived at the}} camp in September and was able to organise for the necessary documents. The necessary objects of worship were secretly scrounged, a bishop's cross, mitre, cassock and cape were improvised and Piquet presided at the secret ceremony, enabling Leisner <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> first mass. The new priest died soon after the liberation of the camp.|$|E
25|$|A special, high gibbet {{was erected}} in the {{marketplace}} at Launceston, and Mayne was executed there on 29 November 1577. He {{was not allowed to}} speak to the crowd, but only <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> prayers quietly. Just {{as he was about to}} be hanged, he refused to implicate his co-religionists. It is unclear if he died on the gibbet. One source states that he was cut down alive, but in falling struck his head against the butcher's scaffold. In any case, he was unconscious when being drawn and quartered.|$|E

25|$|The discussions treat {{of various}} subjects. The maggid enjoins Karo to be modest in the extreme, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> prayers {{with the utmost}} devotion, to be gentle and patient always. Especial stress is laid on asceticism; and Karo is often {{severely}} rebuked for taking more than one glass of wine, or for eating meat. Whenever Karo did not follow the severe instructions of his maggid, he suddenly heard its warning voice. His mentor also advised him in family affairs, told him what reputation he enjoyed in heaven, and praised or criticized his decisions in religious questions. Karo received new ideas from his maggid {{in regard to the}} Kabbala only; such information was in the nature of sundry cabalistic interpretations of the Pentateuch, that in content, though not in form, remind one of the theories of Karo's pupil, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero.|$|E
25|$|The {{peculiar}} {{nature of}} Casaubon's will leads to suspicion that Ladislaw and Dorothea are lovers, creating awkwardness between the two. Ladislaw is secretly {{in love with}} Dorothea but keeps this to himself, having no desire to involve her in scandal or to cause her disinheritance. He remains in Middlemarch, working as a newspaper editor for Mr Brooke. When Brooke's election campaign collapses, he decides to leave the town and visits Dorothea <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> farewell. But Dorothea has also {{fallen in love with}} Ladislaw, whom she had previously seen only as her husband's unfortunate relative. However, the peculiar nature of Casaubon's will has led her to see him in a new light. Renouncing Casaubon's fortune, she shocks her family again by announcing that she will marry Ladislaw. At the same time, Fred, who has been successful in his new career, marries Mary.|$|E
500|$|Police {{telephone}} logs {{had been}} entered as evidence during the trial, {{but had not}} been noticed by Bamber's lawyers. Bamber's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Neville called police that night <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> daughter had [...] "gone berserk" [...] {{with one of his}} guns. A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response. Police say the officers simply made a mistake.|$|E

Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives {{just in time for}} him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> last words to her and die.

500|$|Isie was an {{intelligent}} young woman who, like Smuts, had scored highly in her Matriculation exam. It was thought, as a girl, {{a future in}} higher education was largely closed to her. The time spent in her company, whether reading poetry and singing together at the piano, or walking together in the mornings and evenings on the journey to and from Victoria College, did much to break down Smuts's social isolation, enabling him to cast some of those protective prejudices which he had harboured of the [...] "puerile element", that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> peers. As {{he wrote in his}} diary some years later: [...] ", less idealistic than I, but more human, recalled me from my intellectual isolation and made me return to my fellows." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{painters}} in the Low Countries, Lochner {{was not so}} concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described {{as one of the}} last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly [...] "drawn into empathy with the revolving forms".|$|E

500|$|That is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> operas did {{not come}} as great innovations. What sounds to a modern {{listener}} as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, Nabucco, came as a something entirely new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, {{there is a significant}} amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E
500|$|His number 4 jersey was retired by the Bruins on January 9, 1979. At the ceremony, {{the crowd}} at Boston Garden would not stop applauding and as a result, most of the evening's program had to be {{scrapped}} {{at the last second}} due to the constant cheering. The crowd did not allow Orr <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>his</b> thank you speech until he put on a Bruins jersey. The day was proclaimed [...] "Bobby Orr Day" [...] in Boston and the event raised thousands of dollars for charity. He attended the Massachusetts Senate and House of Representatives and was given a five-minute standing ovation. Boston Celtics basketball superstar Larry Bird said in his pre-game inspiration that he always looked up at the rafters of the Garden at Orr's retired No. 4, instead of the retired numbers of Celtics stars such as Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, or John Havlicek.|$|E
