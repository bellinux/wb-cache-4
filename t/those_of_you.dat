This {{was supported by the}} NTSB, which determined that the pressure induced by the intense media attention was a [...] "contributing factor" [...] in the accident. ABC's Ted Koppel reflected on the media's role in the tragedy on Nightline: [...] "We need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution...We feed one another: <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> looking for publicity and those of us looking for stories." [...] Koppel ended by asking [...] "whether we in the media...by our ravenous attention contribute to this phenomenon", and answered: [...] "We did." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers held differing {{opinions}} on the game's setting and themes. Sumner stated the game is [...] "dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay."

[...] Douglas was critical of the game's themes; he described playing Soft & Cuddly as [...] "watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging {{up and down like}} a box of offal".

Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs {{and walked out of the}} venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'"

500|$|Polka Party! {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Allmusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that [...] "just about anyone could feel let down by this album." [...] Chadbourne was largely {{critical of the}} parody choices, noting {{that many of the}} original versions would be forgotten in [...] "fifteen years". Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault gave Polka Party! an F and described it as an album that [...] "seemed like it could well have been the 'last call' for Yankovic." [...] Thelen heavily criticized the record, writing that both the parodies and originals were not good and that [...] "Yankovic [...] going through the motions". Rolling Stone awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, tying it with the 1992 album Off the Deep End and the 1999 release Running with Scissors as Yankovic's best-rated album. Although it was not a critical success, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1987, but lost to Bill Cosby's <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>You</b> with or Without Children, You'll Understand.|$|E

Heads-up for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> who missed the other warning threads and {{need a place to}} completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is {{to make it easier to}} use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. [...] This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal... so, hold on to your hats. [...] <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> waiting for the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy.
