5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern.

5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
