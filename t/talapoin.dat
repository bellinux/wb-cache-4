60|$|The main point, doubtless, for us all, is {{his love}} of Teufelsdrockh, which indeed was also {{by far the most}} decisive feature of Heuschrecke himself. We are enabled to assert that he hung on the Professor with the fondness of a Boswell for his Johnson. And perhaps with the like return; for Teufelsdrockh treated his gaunt admirer with little outward regard, as some half-rational or {{altogether}} irrational friend, and at best loved him out of gratitude and by habit. On the other hand, it was curious to observe with what reverent kindness, and a sort of fatherly protection, our Hofrath, being the elder, richer, and as he fondly imagined far more practically influential of the two, looked and tended on his little Sage, whom he seemed to consider as a living oracle. Let but Teufelsdrockh open his mouth, Heuschrecke's also unpuckered itself into a free doorway, besides his being all eye and all ear, so that nothing might be lost: and then, at every pause in the harangue, he gurgled out his pursy chuckle of a cough-laugh (for the machinery of laughter took some time to get in motion, and seemed crank and slack), or else his twanging nasal, Bravo! Das glaub' ich; in either case, by way of heartiest approval. In short, if Teufelsdrockh was Dalai-Lama, of which, except perhaps in his self-seclusion, and godlike indifference, there was no symptom, then might Heuschrecke pass for his chief <b>Talapoin,</b> to whom no dough-pill he could knead and publish was other than medicinal and sacred.|$|E

5000|$|The Angolan <b>talapoin</b> is both diurnal and mainly arboreal, they {{occasionally}} {{descend to}} the ground while foraging. They are proficient swimmers and a common defensive strategy is to sleep on branches overhanging rivers {{so that they can}} dive into the water escape from danger. [...] The social organisation of the Angola <b>talapoin</b> is that they live in quite large groups of 60 to 100 animals. At night the group is gathered together in trees close to the water, splitting up into smaller sub-groups in the morning so that they can spread out to forage. Each group normally consists of several fully mature males, many females and their offspring. Angolan talapoins do not show any territoriality, which is unlike their close relatives the guenons. They seem to enjoy play and this mostly takes place between juveniles, however, the males tend to engage in social play more often than female. The home ranges of the Angola <b>talapoin</b> are likely to be larger, and the population densities lower, than is the case with Gabon <b>talapoin</b> because forest strips are narrower and resources scarcer. The fluctuations in climate since the last glaciation have probably reinforced this species' primary adaptation to 'strip living' as longer dry seasons and less extensive flooding under the generally cooler and drier climate that now dominates outside the rainforest seems to have favoured more terrestrial habits than are apparent in the Gabon <b>talapoin.</b> It mainly feeds on fruits, but also on seeds, young foliage, and invertebrates.|$|E

50|$|In {{non-human}} primates, copulatory vocalizations begin {{towards the}} end of the copulatory act or even after copulation. The percentage of vocalizations after copulation varies dependent on the non-human primate species studied. In long-tail macaques, for instance, 80% of copulations are followed by copulation calls. In contrast, the percentage for chimpanzees and Tonkean macaques has been found to be 78.8% and 6%, respectively. There is little consensus on what causes these inter-specific differences, given the lack of consistent findings within the literature. The typical quantity of specimen that are tested in experimental settings is often too low in order to allow any general conclusions about the species as a whole.Another aspect of coital vocalization that varies according to species is the form of the call: in macaques and baboons they manifest themselves as grunts, whereas other species such as <b>talapoins</b> and chimpanzees typically emit screaming sounds. The quality and structure of copulatory calls are analyzed by comparing their respective spectrograms in terms of their frequency. Accordingly, some species produce calls that are structurally more complex than that of others. This is linked to the amount of promiscuity exhibited, in a way that more promiscuous species emit more faceted calls in order to convey more information about themselves and hence render self-advertisement more efficient.|$|R
60|$|And it is {{the more}} {{necessary}} that the good people of England should have liberty to choose some other Scripture, because all Christian priests differ {{so much about the}} copies of theirs, and about the various readings of the several manuscripts, which quite destroys the authority of the Bible: for what authority can a book pretend to, where there are various readings?[10] And for this reason, it is manifest that no man can know the opinions of Aristotle or Plato, or believe the facts related by Thucydides or Livy, or be pleased with the poetry of Homer and Virgil, all which books are utterly useless, upon account of their various readings. Some books of Scripture are said to be lost, and this utterly destroys the credit of those that are left: some we reject, which the Africans and Copticks receive; and why may we not think freely, and reject the rest? Some think the scriptures wholly inspired, some partly; and some not at all. Now this is just the very case of the Bramins, Persees, Bonzes, <b>Talapoins,</b> Dervises, Rabbis, and all other priests, who build their religion upon books, as our priests do upon their Bibles; they all equally differ about the copies, various readings and inspirations, of their several Scriptures, and God knows which are in the right: Freethinking alone can determine it.|$|R
6000|$|But, {{without the}} {{privilege}} of freethinking, {{how is it possible}} to know which is the right Scripture? Here are perhaps twenty sorts of Scriptures in the several parts of the world, and every set of priests contend that their Scripture is the true one. The Indian Brahmins have a book of scripture called the Shaster; the Persees their Zundivastaw;[9] the Bonzes in China have theirs, written by the disciples of Fo-he, whom they call God and Saviour of the world, who was born to teach the way of salvation, and to give satisfaction for all men's sins: which, you see, is directly the same with what our priests pretend of Christ. And must we not think freely, to find out which are in the right, whether the Bishops or the Bonzes? But the <b>Talapoins,</b> or heathen clergy of Siam, approach yet nearer to the system of our priests; they have a Book of Scripture written by Sommonocodam, who, the Siamese say, was [...] "born of a virgin," [...] and was [...] "the God expected by the Universe;" [...] just as our priests tell us, that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, and was the Messiah so long expected. The Turkish priests, or dervises, have their Scripture which they call the Alcoran. The Jews have the Old Testament for their Scripture, and the Christians have both the Old and the New. Now among all these Scriptures, there cannot above one be right; and how is it possible to know which is that, without reading them all, and then thinking freely, every one of us for ourselves, without following the advice or instruction of any guide, before we venture to choose? The parliament ought to be at the charge of finding a sufficient number of these Scriptures, for every one of Her Majesty's subjects, for there are twenty to one against us, that we may be in the wrong: But a great deal of freethinking will at last set us all right, and every one will adhere to the Scripture he likes best; by which means, religion, peace, and wealth, will be for ever secured in Her Majesty's realms.|$|R

To assess human exposure to STLVs in western Central Africa, we screened for STLV infection in primates hunted {{in the rain}} forests of Cameroon. Blood was obtained from 524 animals representing 18 different species. All the animals were wild caught between 1999 and 2002; 328 animals were sampled as bush meat and 196 were pets. Overall, 59 (11. 2 %) of the primates had antibodies cross-reacting with HTLV- 1 and/or HTLV- 2 antigens; HTLV- 1 infection was confirmed in 37 animals, HTLV- 2 infection was confirmed in 9, dual HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 infection was confirmed in 10, and results for 3 animals were indeterminate. Prevalences of infection were significantly lower in pets than in bush meat, 1. 5 versus 17. 0 %, respectively. Discriminatory PCRs identified STLV- 1, STLV- 3, and STLV- 1 and STLV- 3 in HTLV- 1 -, HTLV- 2 -, and HTLV- 1 - and HTLV- 2 -cross-reactive samples, respectively. We identified {{for the first time}} STLV- 1 sequences in mustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus), <b>talapoins</b> (Miopithecus ogouensis), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and confirmed STLV- 1 infection in mandrills, African green monkeys, agile mangabeys, and crested mona and greater spot-nosed monkeys. STLV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and env sequences revealed that the strains belonged to different PTLV- 1 subtypes. A high prevalence of PTLV infection was observed among agile mangabeys (Cercocebus agilis); 89 % of bush meat was infected with STLV. Cocirculation of STLV- 1 and STLV- 3 and STLV- 1 -STLV- 3 coinfections were identified among the agile mangabeys. Phylogenetic analyses of partial LTR sequences indicated that the agile mangabey STLV- 3 strains were more related to the STLV- 3 CTO 604 strain isolated from a red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) from Cameroon than to the STLV- 3 PH 969 strain from an Eritrean baboon or the PPA-F 3 strain from a baboon in Senegal. Our study documents {{for the first time that}} (i) a substantial proportion of wild-living monkeys in Cameroon is STLV infected, (ii) STLV- 1 and STLV- 3 cocirculate in the same primate species, (iii) coinfection with STLV- 1 and STLV- 3 occurs in agile mangabeys, and (iv) humans are exposed to different STLV- 1 and STLV- 3 subtypes through handling primates as bush meat. status: publishe...|$|R

Of particular interest was the status of the elephant population in the area, including any evidence of seasonal movements. The large mammal and bird surveys were carried out by WCS, helped by Deborah Pires who surveyed the bats and small mammals. The Birdlife Important Bird Area team also surveyed {{the northern part of the}} Park in 2000. Four major surveys were carried out, covering all four quarters of the Park. The fauna is very diverse. As in many Central African sites, large mammal abundance increases with increased distance from the road and the villages. True savannah species such as baboon Papio anubis and warthog Phacochoerus africanus occur literally within metres of species of true forest animals, including crowned guenon Cercopithecus pogonias and red river hog Potamochoerus porcus, which here are found right up to the edges of the savannah. All three species of pig occur in the Park (red river hog, warthog, and giant forest hog Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), and there are hippo Hippopotamus amphibius at several sites along the Djerem river (Fig. 6). In addition, there are species of forest-savannah mosaic habitats such as bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus and yellowbacked duiker Cephalophus sylvicultor. Within a few hundred metres it is possible to see signs of Kob Kobus kob, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, and forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus, and to hear putty-nosed monkeys Cercopithecus nictitans -a strange mixture of forest and savannah wildlife all at one site. Ungulate diversity is high: apart from those mentioned above there are bongo and sitatunga (Tragelaphus euryceros and T. scriptus), several species of duiker (confirmed are Blue, red-flanked, Grimm’s, Black-fronted). The presence of at least ten species of primate, including chimpanzees Pan troglodytes has been confirmed by the study teams either by direct observation of animals or their signs or by hearing their vocalisations, and local hunters suggested there could be still more. They described a tiny monkey that lived in large groups near rivers, which were <b>talapoin.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} a novel lentivirus prevalent in <b>talapoin</b> monkeys (Myopithecus <b>talapoin),</b> extending previous observations of human immunodeficiency virus- 1 cross-reactive antibodies in the serum of these monkeys. We obtained a virus isolate from one of three seropositive monkeys initially available to us. The virus was tentatively named simian immunodeficiency virus from <b>talapoin</b> monkeys (SIVtal). Despite the difficulty of isolating this virus, it was readily passed between monkeys in captivity through unknown routes of transmission. The virus could be propagated for short terms in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of <b>talapoin</b> monkeys but not in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or human T cell lines. The propagated virus was used to infect a naive <b>talapoin</b> monkey, four rhesus macaques (M. mulatta), and two cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis). All animals seroconverted and virus could be reisolated during a short period after experimental infection. A survey of SIVtal-infected captive <b>talapoin</b> monkeys revealed a relative decrease in CD 4 + cell numbers in chronically (> 2 years) infected animals. No other signs of immunodeficiency were observed in any of the infected animals. PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing of two fragments of the polymerase gene revealed that SIVtal is different from the presently known lentiviruses and perhaps most related to the SIV from Sykes monkeys...|$|E
40|$|WOS:A 1974 V 150000004 International audienceThe vocal {{repertoire}} of <b>talapoin</b> monkeys consists of eleven basic vocal types within which 31 different sounds are described, including all intermediates, "lip-smacking" and branch noises (linked with cohesion calls). Calls are of short duration (1 / 20 s {{to a few}} seconds). Some {{of them have a}} daily rhythm of emission. Their intensity is variable, the call range varying accordingly from a few to several (more) hundred meters. <b>Talapoin</b> calls are composed either of low-pitched structures, of high-pitched ones, or an association of the two. Seven calls, of the eleven basic types possess low-pitched components (pitch = 0. 5 to 1 KHz) giving them a common quality, constituting what may be called the "talapoin voice". Two graded systems have been described. One, the most graded, is composed of the aggression-flight vocal types; the second is linked with group cohesion. The important level of gradation within the vocal {{repertoire of}} this forest species contradicts the classical concepts which ascribe a "discret" repertoire to monkeys living in a closed milieu. The gradation of the vocal system of a species may be related more to an abundance of social contacts than to the structure of the milieu (multimodality of signals exchanged over short distances). During ontogeny, the vocal repertoire changes in both type and frequency of use. The structural modifications are either continuous, with the growth of individuals, or discontinuous with the sexual maturity of males. Under conditions of average excitation, differential call distribution and their relative frequency according to different individual classes lead us to generalize that the vocal behaviour of a particular class in a group (age, sex and social status) always differ qualitatively and quantitatively from that of other classes. Under conditions of high excitation, differential call distribution and their relative frequency according to different individual classes, lead us to generalize that any individual can give any call type when submitted to adequate stimulation. This difference between the real potentiality of a given individual and actual use in the wild is essentially related to the change of stimulating context as the monkeys grows older. In order to vocalize, the <b>talapoin</b> must receive stimulation which increases its excitation level and directs its response. Furthermore the excitation level does not directly determine a particular vocal type. The vocal response varies according to the situation and is adapted to the stimulus context. We distinguish between stimuli which propagate calls within a social group from those initiating calls. The former are essentially calls of congeners, the latter are more often visual, visual auditory, auditory then tactile. The majority of <b>talapoin</b> calls control the spatial distribution of the troop members in relation to external events (cohesion calls system, aggression-flight calls, mother-young contact calls). Choruses however have a more complex social role which is not completely understood. With a maximal energy concentrated around 0. 9 KHz, the "lost" calls of young seem to be adapted to penetrate the forest milieu. The presence in certain calls of high-pitched components appears to be linked principally to the rise of the excitation level of the vocalizers. With eleven vocal types, the <b>talapoin</b> has a repertoire comparable to that of other monkeys. It is sympatric with Cercopithecus nictitans, C. cephus, C. pogonias and C. neglectus with which it shares a number of functional categories of calls, features probably imposed by forest conditions (poor visibility, winged predators, [...] .) examples are the cohesion system, dispersion calls, aggressive alarm to birds). Conversely, the physical structure of calls of genus Miopithecus and Cercopithecus have little in common. The frequent choruses in <b>talapoin</b> seem to be related to a more complex social life than that of the Cercopithecines. The <b>talapoin</b> is differentiated strongly from the sympatric species in the absence of loud calls, the specific characters of call structures and their more graded nature. A similar degree of differentiation is found in the morphological, physiological and eco-ethological traits characterizing the <b>talapoin</b> (Gautier-Hion, 1970, 1971 a, b). Although some <b>talapoin</b> calls are higher-pitched than those of macaques, there are affinities between the vocalizations of <b>talapoin</b> and macaques: both have graded call systems arising in aggression-flight behaviour and there are similarities in calls with tonal structure: types 2 of talapoin; clear calls of M. mulatta (Rowell & Hinde, 1962); "coos" and "high-pitched musical notes" of M. nemestrina (Grimm, (1967); "coos" of M. speriosa (Bertrand, 1969); "coo sounds" of M. fuscata (Green, in press). Finally, there is a close structural resemblance between the "lost" calls of infants <b>talapoin</b> and rhesus...|$|E
