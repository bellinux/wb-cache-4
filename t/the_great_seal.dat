5|$|In 1239 Neville {{may have}} been offered the custody of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal,</b> which he refused. In May 1242 Neville was once again {{responsible}} for the seal while Henry was in France, a responsibility apparently shared with the regent. After the king's return in September 1243 Neville did seal a few documents with <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> until his death a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Neville's {{activities}} {{during the years}} immediately after 1207 are unknown, owing {{to the lack of}} royal records, but in December 1213 he was given custody of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of the kingdom. He was Dean of Lichfield by 11 April 1214, at which time he held a prebend in the diocese of London. Neville was appointed to the royal chancery in about 1214, largely through the patronage of Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester and one of the king's favourites. From March to October 1214, Neville was in France with the king. After the king returned to England after 1214, Neville remained in royal service until at least May 1216, although without custody of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal.</b> His {{activities during}} the final period of John's reign prior to the king's sudden death in October 1216 are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Published in 1876 by Louis Prang and {{illustrated}} by Henry Mitchell, State Arms of the Union contains a chromolithographed title page depicting <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of the United States and seven color plates with 45 state and territorial coats of arms. The book was likely published for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal,</b> the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal,</b> when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E

5|$|An {{impression}} of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> {{of a state}} (or its coat of arms) has long been required on official documents ranging from deeds to legislative acts. It was the emblem that certified the authenticity of a given document or that {{the authority of the}} state was invested in said document. Judicial decisions upheld the need for a valid seal and/or coat of arms on notarized documents.|$|E
5|$|As {{keeper of}} the seal, and {{subsequently}} as chancellor, Neville was noted for his impartiality, and he oversaw a number {{of changes in the}} way the chancery operated. Neville was deprived of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> in 1238 after quarrelling with the king, but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed Chancery Lane owing to his connection with the chancery.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully {{sovereign}} from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of Canada for Elizabeth II, where the title has been redefined as Queen of Canada. These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.|$|E

He made <b>the</b> last <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> for Queen Victoria (1899), and many designs for official seals for the colonies. At {{the time of his}} death he was preparing the models for <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>seals</b> of <b>the</b> United Kingdom and those of Ireland and Scotland, subsequently executed by Frank Bowcher. He was an exhibitor at the Royal Academy, 1898-1903.|$|R

5|$|The {{bald eagle}} is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons.|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{a keeper}} of the king's seal, serving as deputy to Simon of Wells, the Archdeacon of Wells who was Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> from around 1199 to 1204. Simon was also a {{relative}} of Hugh's, and seems to have helped secure positions for both Hugh and Jocelin in the royal administration. Hugh was a royal clerk in the chancery, the royal secretariat, and was named Archdeacon of Wells sometime before 25 April 1204. He held prebends in the diocese of Lincoln and diocese of London as well. His service in the chancery would have involved him in Hubert Walter's administrative innovations during his term as Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Scottish heraldry, use of the banner is not restricted to the sovereign. Several Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland are permitted to use the Royal Banner of Scotland, including; the First Minister of Scotland (as Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of Scotland), Lord Lieutenants within their respective Lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|On Richard's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of England in 1189 Longchamp became Chancellor of England. Longchamp paid 3,000 pounds (£) {{for the office of}} Chancellor. This was followed by an increase in the price of having chancery documents sealed with <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal,</b> necessary for their authentication, perhaps to help Longchamp recoup the cost of office. At the council held at Pipewell on 15September 1189, the King raised Longchamp to the bishopric of Ely. Richard named three other bishops at the same time: Godfrey de Lucy to Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to London, and Hubert Walter to Salisbury. Longchamp was consecrated on 31December 1189 and enthroned at Ely on 6January 1190.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Neville (or Ralf Nevill; died 1244) was {{a medieval}} clergyman and {{politician}} {{who served as}} Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor of England. Neville first appears in the historical record in 1207 {{in the service of}} King John of England, and remained in royal service throughout the rest of his life. By 1213 Neville had custody of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of England, although he was not named chancellor, the office responsible for the seal, until 1226. He was rewarded with the bishopric of Chichester in 1222. Although he was also briefly Archbishop-elect of Canterbury and Bishop-elect of Winchester, both elections were set aside, or quashed, and he held neither office.|$|E

The fleur-de-lis charge seen in today's arms originally appeared on coins minted in the town, beginning in 1227. Smaller town seals in the 14th century also showed the lis, with the gateway only appearing on <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R

5|$|Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth's special friends by PhilipII's {{envoy to}} the English court a week before Queen Mary's death. On 18November 1558, the morning after Elizabeth's accession, Dudley {{witnessed}} the surrender of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> to her at Hatfield. He became Master of the Horse on the same day. This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign. It suited him, as he was an excellent horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation, horse breeding, and the supply of horses for all occasions. Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing {{a large part of}} the Queen's coronation festivities.|$|E
5|$|The first {{committee}} to design <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> of the United States was appointed on 4 July 1776 by the Second Continental Congress {{and consisted of}} Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson. Their design was rejected on 20 August 1776. The second committee (James Lovell, John Morin Scott, and William Churchill Houston) design met with the same fate. It was the third committee (Arthur Middleton, Elias Boudinot, John Rutledge, who consulted with William Barton) that submitted a design which was approved on 20 July 1782.|$|E
5|$|The king {{attempted}} to deprive Neville of the chancellorship in 1236, which the bishop countered {{by claiming that}} {{as he had been}} appointed during the royal minority with the consent of the great council, only the council could dismiss him. In 1238 the cathedral chapter of the see of Winchester elected as Bishop of Winchester first William de Raley in opposition to the king's choice of William the Bishop of Valence, and when that election was quashed, they elected Neville. His election to Winchester was quashed in 1239, leading to a quarrel with Henry III. Valence was the uncle of Eleanor of Provence, whom Henry had married in 1236. Valence had gained much influence with the king quite quickly, and worked to eliminate the older royal officials and institute reforms in the royal administration. This, along with the disputed election to Winchester, was the cause of Neville's fall from favour. Although Henry deprived Neville of the custody of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> from 1238 until 1242, Neville retained the title of chancellor until his death, thus entitling him to the revenues he would normally have received from the office. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seal</b> itself was held by a number of minor officials, probably to allow Henry greater control over its use by preventing the establishment of another powerful official who might interfere with his plans. But they lacked the power base that Neville had possessed, which enabled him to oppose the king.|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese emperors, their {{families}} and officials used large seals known as xǐ (...) , later renamed bǎo (...) , which corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Seals</b> of Western countries. These were usually made of jade (although hard wood or precious metal could also be used), and were originally square in shape. They were changed to a rectangular form during the Song dynasty, but reverted to square during the Qing dynasty.|$|R
