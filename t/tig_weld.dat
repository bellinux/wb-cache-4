40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference between tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of austenitic stainless steel assisted by microparticle oxides and that assisted by nanoparticle oxides. SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 were used to investigate the effects of the thermal stability and the particle size of the activated compounds on the surface appearance, geometric shape, angular distortion, delta ferrite content and Vickers hardness of the UNS S 31603 stainless steel <b>TIG</b> <b>weld.</b> The results show that the use of SiO 2 leads to a satisfactory surface appearance compared to that of the <b>TIG</b> <b>weld</b> made with Al 2 O 3. The surface appearance of the <b>TIG</b> <b>weld</b> made with nanoparticle oxide has less flux slag compared with the one made with microparticle oxide of the same type. Compared with microparticle SiO 2, the TIG welding with nanoparticle SiO 2 has the potential benefits of high joint penetration and less angular distortion in the resulting weldment. The TIG welding with nanoparticle Al 2 O 3 does not result in a significant increase in the penetration or reduction of distortion. The TIG welding with microparticle or nanoparticle SiO 2 uses a heat source with higher power density, resulting in a higher ferrite content and hardness of the stainless steel weld metal. In contrast, microparticle or nanoparticle Al 2 O 3 results in no significant difference in metallurgical properties compared to that of the C-TIG weld metal. Compared with oxide particle size, the thermal stability of the oxide plays a significant role in enhancing the joint penetration capability of the weld, for the UNS S 31603 stainless steel TIG welds made with activated oxides...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study the use of diode laser for {{stainless}} steel aesthetic welding is considered. In fact the surface smoothness of the weld bead, attributed to the mode stability of the laser system, suggests its application for aesthetic weld joint. The aims of this work were to: define a process map, based on an aesthetic criterion; mechanically characterize the weld joints (by Vickers micro-hardness and tensile test); analyse {{the surface of the}} specimens in terms of roughness. Moreover, gas tungsten-arc (<b>TIG)</b> <b>weld</b> joints were carried out and analogously tested to make a comparison with the diode laser results. Good aesthetic butt joints were obtained with diode laser welding. The same results were found working with constant power speed ratio (i. e. constant fluence). Comparison between TIG and Laser Beam Welding (LBW), showed no significant difference in roughness, while ultimate tensile load was higher for TIG welding. The differences in joint strength depend on the different cross-sectional area and on the extension and microstructure of the base metal, heat-affected zone and melted zone.

40|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is fundamental in those industries {{where it is}} important to control the weld bead shape and its metallurgical characteristics. However, compared to the other arc welding process, the shallow penetration of the TIG welding restricts its ability to weld thick structures in a single pass (2 mm for stainless steels), thus its productivity is relativity low. This is why there have been several trials to improve the productivity of the TIG welding. The use of activating flux in TIG welding process is one of such attempts. In this study, first, the effect of each TIG welding parameters on the weld’s joint strength was shown and then, the optimal parameters were determined using the Taguchi method with L 9 (9) orthogonal array. SiO 2 and TiO 2 oxide powders were used to investigate the effect of activating flux on the <b>TIG</b> <b>weld</b> mechanical properties of 321 austenitic stainless steel.

This paper presents the work conducted on the material characterizations of a TIG-MIG hybrid welded joint of type 304 austenitic stainless steel. The welding processes were conducted in three phases. The phases of welding employed are MIG welding using a current of 170 A, TIG welding using the current of 190 A, and a hybrid TIG-MIG welding with currents of 190 / 170 A respectively. The MIG, TIG, and hybrid TIG-MIG weldments were characterized with incomplete penetration, full penetration and excess penetration of weld.

40|$|To emulate {{combined}} welding and brazing techniques, {{frequently used}} during the rejuvenation of turbine components, TIG and SWET weld overlays have been applied to the surfaces of a single crystal nickel-based alloy and subsequently overlain with braze and subjected to a typical brazing cycle heat treatment. Both welds comprised of columnar dendritic microstructures with an epitaxial [001] growth orientation near the substrate surface and equiaxed randomly oriented grains at the weld surface. While the <b>TIG</b> <b>weld</b> showed a sharp columnar to equiaxed transition, that for the SWET weld was diffuse and comprised colonies of columnar structures with their [001] misoriented to the epitaxial columnar directions {{as a result of}} shallower temperature gradients. Analysis of the microstructures of the brazed materials showed that the extents of boron penetration were significantly greater for the welds due to enhanced diffusion along grain boundaries between the equiaxed structures compared to y channel limited transport in the single crystal. A striking feature of the diffusion zone microstructures was the development of carbo-boride needles which formed by the reaction of boron, refractory metals and TaC. It is the release of Ta from TaC which stabilises y’ envelope formation around the needles. The post-brazed microstructures of TIG welds used in this study showed considerably fewer detrimental boride precipitates than brazed SWET welds and as a result are expected to show superior mechanical properties...|$|E
