40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>this</b> <b>quasi-experimental</b> {{study was to}} {{investigate}} the effect of using Twitter by high school mathematics students learning linear equations in Algebra 1. <b>This</b> <b>quasi-experimental</b> study used ninth grade Algebra 1 classes that were learning linear equations for 18 school days. ^ First, the nonequivalent control group design, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design, was used in <b>this</b> <b>quasi-experimental</b> study. The research hypotheses were tested using a factorial analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the pretest on linear equations score as the covariate. The control group had three classes (n = 73) and the experimental group had three classes (n = 78). The experimental group received tweets on a daily basis as students learned linear equations. The tweets contained mathematical content, classroom logistics, or both. Lastly, the control group received the same information in class. The quantitative findings of <b>this</b> <b>quasi-experimental</b> study show that overall Twitter, content tweets, logistics tweets, and tweets containing both (content and logistics) did not have a statistically significant effect on the mean linear equations posttest score. ^ Second, <b>this</b> <b>quasi-experimental</b> study looked at students’ performance on various subtopics throughout the unit. The ANCOVA showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the control group and the experimental groups in most of the quizzes. However, statistically significant differences were found in Quiz # 2 and Quiz # 4 among the logistics groups. ^ Third, the experimental group took a 10 -item survey. The purpose of survey was to understand the students’ opinion of using Twitter as they learned course content in Algebra 1. It can be concluded from the results of that survey that students had, for the most part, a positive attitude towards using Twitter as part of learning mathematics in high school. ^ In conclusion, the use of Twitter is not likely to show an increase in students’ mean posttest linear equations score. However, the findings of the survey conducted after the study did show that the use of Twitter might be able to increase student motivation. The results of <b>this</b> <b>quasi-experimental</b> study made major contributions to the literature by investigating the effects of using Twitter in high school Algebra 1. ...|$|E
