Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b> White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which youths in custody 1) rate specific life goals as important and likely to eventuate; 2) have strategies <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> their goals; and 3) can anticipate barriers <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> their goals. Method: A total of 107 detainees drawn from NSW Juvenile Justice centres were interviewed about their life goals. Results: Most youths rated specific life goals, such as having a well-paying job and avoiding trouble with the police, as ‘quite important’ or ‘very important’ goals <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> in the future. When youths were asked how likely it was that these specific goals would be realised, the most common response was ‘quite likely’ or ‘very likely’. The most frequently identified strategies for having a well-paying job included getting the necessary diplomas and starting in a junior position to get experience. The most frequently identified strategies for avoiding trouble with the police were resisting peer pressure and obeying the law. Commonly reported barriers <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> these goals included associating with antisocial peers, drugs and alcohol usage. Many youths also recognised that getting into trouble with the law would also be a barrier to having a well-paying job. Conclusion: Most youths interviewed in this study placed high importance on specific life goals and were generally optimistic about <b>achieving</b> <b>them.</b> Furthermore, most youths could think of strategies that would help <b>them</b> <b>achieve</b> their goals as well as identify possible barriers <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>them.</b> These findings have the potential to help service providers and policy makers target their services and policies appropriately...|$|R

This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone out of his way <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b> We have never had the league's top scorer.

As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like high dynamic range rendering and specular mapping. The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's Gamebryo engine, [...] "tricked out" [...] in collaboration with Bethesda's graphics programmers and NDL. Cheng has described the game as [...] "pixel-shader heavy", taking advantage of the feature in rendering [...] "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin," [...] in addition to water, which was the only use Morrowind made of the technology. In particular, Oblivion uses normal maps, diffuse maps, specular maps, and parallax maps, which Howard described as [...] "kind of like displacement mapping". Oblivion makes use of Radiant AI, a new artificial intelligence system that allows non-player characters to dynamically react and interact with the world around them. General goals, such as [...] "Eat at this city at 2pm" [...] are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>them.</b> The absence of individual scripting for each character allowed {{for the construction of a}} world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aided in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an [...] "organic feel" [...] for the game.|$|E

[...] He also wrote: [...] "The two basic types of competitive advantage [...] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>them</b> lead to three generic strategies for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus.

40|$|Scenario {{development}} is a widely used tool to reduce uncertainty while making decisions in high velocity environments. Nevertheless, many managers have a blinkered obsession with short-term performance objectives out of a fear of an unpredictable future, {{as well as a}} sheer inability to conceive of alternative futures generated in scenario planning exercises. Consequently, the latter have generated little value-added. The paper delineates factors determining the willingness of decision makers to actively engage in processes of scenario planning. We suggest that effective incentives to promote interest in scenario planning can be found if we consider decision makers as ‘consumers’ of certain ideas, concepts, and expectations. In particular, we put forward the hypothesis that the selection of appropriate targets for scenario planning, a commitment <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>them,</b> expectations of positive outcomes, and increasing the frequency of scenario planning exercises are very likely to generate increased interest from managers and stakeholders in developing scenarios...|$|R
