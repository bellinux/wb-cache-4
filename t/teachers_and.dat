5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
30|$|Around {{the same}} time as the microgenetic study, we {{conducted}} a case study of a <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> his students using an early version of Fuzzy Chronicles (Van Eaton et al. 2013). The study explored how the <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> students interacted with the representations in a version of Fuzzy Chronicles that included a timeline structure for placing navigation commands. The goal was to understand how the representations affected the <b>teacher's</b> <b>and</b> students' epistemologies of force. We had hoped that the <b>teacher's</b> <b>and</b> students' understanding of force and motion would become more nuanced and that they would connect their intuitive understanding of physics with formal, canonical understanding of Newton's laws. The study highlighted improvements in the <b>teacher's</b> <b>and</b> students' ability to make phenomenological predictions about what would happen next given a configuration of impulses and their ability to manipulate the representations in the game to successfully complete levels, but it also highlighted how the <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> students ascribed subjective properties to the representations of forces in the game to reconcile phenomena and relationships in the game with their own intuitive understanding of Newton's laws.|$|R
