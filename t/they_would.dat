5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was written}} {{at a more}} rapid pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to the Chili Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, in order to arrange song structures and guitar riffs. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E
5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be wearing their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis {{noted that it}} was in honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public know when <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be wearing their green jerseys.|$|E
5|$|Despite the K Foundation's {{reported}} moratorium, further national screenings of {{the film}} organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not answer questions after the film; instead, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> ask questions of the audience.

6000|$|And he sang! It was soft, at first, and dreamy, {{telling of}} old Germany, {{the mother of}} nations, of the rich, warm plains, and the grey cities, and the fame of dead heroes. But then verse after verse rang like a trumpet-call. It was of the Germany of now, the Germany which had been taken unawares and overthrown, but which was up again, and {{snapping}} the bonds upon her giant limbs. What was life that one should covet it? What was glorious death that one should shun it? The mother, the great mother, was calling. Her sigh was in the night wind. She was crying to her own children for help. <b>Would</b> <b>they</b> come? <b>Would</b> <b>they</b> come? <b>Would</b> <b>they</b> come? ...|$|R
5|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} {{promotion}} for the album, the band were asked what shows <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like {{to appear on}}.

Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.|$|E
5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible. In When You Reach Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising <b>they</b> <b>would</b> return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E

Indeed, several Democrats whose districts voted for Milne over Shumlin said that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> vote for Shumlin, citing his plurality win.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types.
