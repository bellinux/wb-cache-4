5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929, {{which resulted in a}} hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) <b>took</b> <b>office.</b> <b>In</b> 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E

5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, {{and political}} allies seemed to disproportionately benefit from city contracting. He <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> {{a city with}} regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force was an issue in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E
5|$|David N. Cicilline {{finished}} his term as mayor in 2010, {{eight years after}} taking office as the first homosexual mayor of an American state capital.

5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day administration, she probably {{had the power}} to command the governors in the organization of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E

5|$|The Barroso Commission <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> late 2004 {{after being}} delayed by {{objections}} from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing {{size of the}} Commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style {{of control over the}} college, which earned him some criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} were held on May 14, 1989. Menem {{won by a}} wide margin, and became the new president. He was scheduled to take office on December 10, but inflation levels took {{a turn for the}} worse, growing into hyperinflation, causing public riots. The outgoing president Alfonsín resigned and transferred power to Menem five months early, on July 8. Menem's accession marked the first time since Hipólito Yrigoyen <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> 1916 that an incumbent government was peacefully succeeded by a president from an opposition party.|$|E

These boards were overseen by the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (ICIS) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB). The NSRB was charged with developing security programs for industry and several were developed jointly with representatives from the power, transportation, explosives, petroleum, and communications industries. Since he was directly responsible to the Secretary of Commerce, after the Republican Administration <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> 1953, Uanna found himself without a job.|$|E

5|$|Husayn Pasha's replacement, Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, who <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> 1760, {{sought to}} {{retrieve}} control of Haifa from Zahir. Uthman Pasha {{requested that the}} governor of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761. The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over {{with the assistance of}} an Istanbul-based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high-ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders.|$|E

5|$|Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. When President William McKinley <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal Party's {{decision}} not to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin's unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald's first minority Labour government which <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> January 1924. According to Lansbury's biographer, Bondfield turned down the offer of a cabinet post; instead, she became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour, Tom Shaw. This appointment meant {{that she had to}} give up the TUC Council chair; her decision to do so, immediately after becoming the first woman to achieve this honour, generated some criticism from other trade unionists.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} with Libya, the imposition by Nigeria {{of an economic}} boycott, and international pressure led to a new international peace conference in Lagos in August, to which all eleven factions present in Chad participated. A new accord was signed on 21 August, under which a new GUNT was to be formed, open to all factions. The French troops were to leave Chad and {{be replaced by a}} multinational African peace force. The new GUNT <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> November, with Goukouni President, Kamougué Vice-President, Habré Defence Minister and Acyl Foreign Minister. Despite the presence of Habré, the new composition of the GUNT had enough pro-Libyans to satisfy Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|The post-genocide Rwandan {{government}} <b>took</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Kigali in July 1994. It {{was based}} loosely on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana's party, MRND was outlawed.

Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence while Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs, but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and was the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E
