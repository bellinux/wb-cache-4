40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Increased {{understanding}} of “how” and “for whom” treatment {{works at the}} level of the brain has potential to transform addiction treatment through the development of innovative neuroscience-informed interventions. The 2015 Science of Change meeting bridged the fields of neuroscience and psychotherapy research to identify brain mechanisms of behavior change that are “common” across therapies and “specific” to distinct behavioral interventions. Recent findings Conceptual models of brain mechanisms underlying cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness interventions, and motivational interviewing differ in targeting brain circuits representing “top-down” cognitive control and “bottom-up” processing of reward. Methods for integrating neuroimaging into psychotherapy research can reveal recovery of brain functioning with sustained abstinence, which may be facilitated by psychotherapy and cognitive <b>training.</b> <b>Summary</b> Neuroimaging provides powerful tools for determining brain mechanisms underlying treatment effects, predicting and monitoring outcomes, developing novel neuroscience-informed interventions, and identifying for whom an intervention will be effective.

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} identifying healthcare needs in a climate-changing world. However, while there are now global and national policy statements about the importance of health workforce development for climate change, little has been published about what competencies might be demanded of practitioners in a climate-changing world. In such a context, this debate and discussion paper aims to explore the nature of key competencies and related opportunities for teaching climate change in medical education and training. Particular emphasis is made on preparation for practice in rural and remote regions likely to be greatly affected by climate change. Discussion The paper describes what kinds of competencies for climate change might be included in medical education and training. It explores which curricula, teaching, learning and assessment approaches might be involved. Rather than arguing for major changes to medical education and training, this paper explores well established precedents to offer practical suggestions for where a particular kind of literacy [...] eco-medical literacy [...] and related competencies could be naturally integrated into existing elements of medical education and <b>training.</b> <b>Summary</b> The health effects of climate change have, generally, not yet been integrated into medical education and training systems. However, the necessary competencies could be taught by building on existing models, best practice and innovative traditions in medicine. Even in crowded curricula, climate change offers an opportunity to reinforce and extend understandings of how interactions between people and place affect health. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Innovations {{in modern}} {{technologies}} allow students access to educational resources {{in very different}} ways to traditional teaching methodologies. As such, and as part of a Student Selected Component, we created an e- tutorial on the arteries of the human body, linked into learning objectives of the Glasgow medical curriculum. Summary of Work: An interactive e-tutorial on the arterial supply of the human body was created using Adobe Captivate 9. The e-tutorial details the arterial supply of the body in anatomical regions. Interactivity is incorporated as quizzes, clinical items, and detailed anatomy for early stage medical <b>training.</b> <b>Summary</b> of Results: The e-tutorial was designed by students, for students as a pilot study. We shall present the ongoing evaluation from student users from pre-and post-evaluation surveys. The methodology of how to create an e-tutorial will also be discussed. Discussion: The unique feature of this project is that the anatomical material is validated, and has involved students creating it for their peers. A constructivist approach has also been adopted, with students as co-creators of the educational and training materials, and enhances digital skills. Conclusion: The interactivity of e-tutorials allows an alternative teaching and learning method to lectures, books and dissections. The e-tutorial can be used in places where accessibility, or use of traditional resources may be challenging. The resource is easy to use and tailored to target students. Take-home Message: The e-tutorial created is a valuable teaching resource created for students, made accessible and user friendly for all.

Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of surgical simulation compared with other methods of surgical <b>training.</b> <b>Summary</b> Background Data: Surgical simulation (with or without computers) is attractive because it avoids the use of patients for skills practice and provides relevant technical training for trainees before they operate on humans. Methods: Studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases until April 2005. Included studies must have been randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing any training technique using at least some elements of surgical simulation, which reported measures of surgical task performance. Results: Thirty RCTs with 760 participants were able to be included, although the quality of the RCTs was often poor. Computer simulation generally showed better results than no training at all (and than physical trainer/model training in one RCT), but was not convincingly superior to standard training (such as surgical drills) or video simulation (particularly when assessed by operative performance). Video simulation did not show consistently better results than groups with no training at all, and there were not enough data to determine if video simulation was better than standard training or the use of models. Model simulation may have been better than standard training, and cadaver training may have been better than model training. Conclusions: While there may be compelling reasons to reduce reliance on patients, cadavers, and animals for surgical training, none of the methods of simulated training has yet been shown to be better than other forms of surgical training.

We find a significant and negative relationship between educational attainment and on the job training and no significant relationship between education and off the job training. We also find that education and training are technical complements, {{especially in the case of}} off the job training. These findings are consistent with more educated individuals having higher marginal costs of training than less educated workers, especially where on the job training is concerned. Either the better educated have lower learning skills in jobs requiring on the job training or they have higher opportunity costs of training, or both.

40|$|Intensive {{treadmill}} training after incomplete {{spinal cord}} injury can improve functional walking abilities. To determine the changes in muscle activation patterns {{that are associated with}} improvements in walking, we measured the electromyography (EMG) of leg muscles in 17 individuals with incomplete {{spinal cord injury}} during similar walking conditions both before and after training. Specific differences were observed between subjects that eventually gained functional improvements in overground walking (responders), compared with subjects where treadmill training was ineffective (nonresponders). Although both groups developed a more regular and less clonic EMG pattern on the treadmill, it was only the tibialis anterior and hamstring muscles in the responders that displayed increases in EMG activation. Likewise, only the responders demonstrated decreases in burst duration and cocontraction of proximal (hamstrings and quadriceps) muscle activity. Surprisingly, the proximal muscle activity in the responders, unlike nonresponders, was three- to fourfold greater than that in uninjured control subjects walking at similar speeds and level of body weight support, suggesting that the ability to modify muscle activation patterns after injury may predict the ability of subjects to further compensate in response to motor <b>training.</b> In <b>summary,</b> increases in the amount and decreases in the duration of EMG activity of specific muscles are associated with functional recovery of walking skills after treadmill training in subjects that are able to modify muscle activity patterns following incomplete spinal cord injury...|$|R

This thesis explores the impact of exacerbations in COPD and chronic respiratory disease. In the first study I have investigated the effects of an early rehabilitation intervention on healthcare utilisation, strength and exercise capacity by conducting a large randomised control trial. Using a sub-group of this cohort I have then explored factors that predict hospital readmission. Finally I have conducted a study of single leg neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in stable COPD, alongside a resistance training group. No difference was seen following early rehabilitation in hospitalisation, healthcare utilisation or physical performance. A number of unexpected findings were noted, including an increase in 12 month mortality in the intervention group and large functional recovery in the usual care group. Using multivariate analysis three risk factors for hospital readmission were identified, including quadriceps cross sectional area, using ultrasound. In the stable state NMES was seen to significantly increase muscle mass from baseline, comparable to changes seen using resistance <b>training.</b> In <b>summary</b> early rehabilitation in chronic respiratory disease does not impact on future hospitalisation.

The new methodology uses driving simulators for whole task practice and for measuring driver-performance. It places simulator-based practice between initial classroom instruction and test-track driver training. Prior analyses of the data collected for 355 drivers in the first year demonstrated that UDPS had successfully achieved: (1) objective measures of driver performance to establish pass/fail criteria, (2) effective motivation for drivers to improve their own performance, and (3) measures of the overall effectiveness of the <b>training</b> process. <b>Summary</b> reports of the first year of data collected at UDPS demonstrated: (1) SAS mitigation levels below the occurrence of test-track discomfort, and (2) a 67 % reduction in risk for collisions by reduction of critical errors. The above success led to expanding the training to 598 new trainees in the second year. This paper reviews new driver performance data collected during 2006. Two additional trainers participated in that process. Analysis of this new data not only confirms the first year’s analysis, but newly establishes that: (1) improvement in driver performance is independent of the trainer(s), and (2) training benefit is a function of the sequence and number of exercises...|$|R

We approach this problem by learning a mapping from visual texture observed from an onboard camera to the landing behaviour on a set of sample materials. In this case we exemplify our framework by predicting the yaw angle of the MAV after landing. Our framework demonstrates the applicability of established texture classification methods usually tested on stationary camera setups for the more challenging case of textures observed from a MAV. Results for supervised training demonstrate good estimation of the landing behaviour and motivate future work to implement autonomous decision making strategies and other behaviour predictions based on imagery. motion traces energy accuracy motion <b>summaries</b> <b>training</b> flights visual data descriptors actual flight visual data descriptor I...|$|R
