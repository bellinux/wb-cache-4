50|$|From early 1930s, the Japanese army began experimenting on a {{mechanized}} warfare unit combining infantry with tanks. However, the Type 89 Medium tank {{could not}} {{keep pace with the}} motorized infantry, which could move at 40 km/h by truck. In combat, motorized infantry could only hope to achieve 40 km advance per day. For <b>transport,</b> <b>tanks</b> could be loaded on train platforms like in any other army of the times. To solve this problem, the Army Technical Bureau proposed a new light tank of 7 tonnes or less capable of 40 km/h speed and started development in 1933.|$|E

Significant oil fields were exploited in Alberta (Canada) from 1947.First offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons in 1949.Availability of oil and access to it, became of [...] "cardinal importance" [...] in military power before and after World War I, particularly for navies as they changed from coal, {{but also with the}} introduction of motor <b>transport,</b> <b>tanks</b> and airplanes. Such thinking would continue in later conflicts of the twentieth century, including World War II, during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were extensively bombed.In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered in the Al-Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5000|$|By mid 2009, {{the water}} crisis was {{so large and}} widespread, that WASA decided to <b>transport</b> <b>tanks</b> of water on trucks to major areas of the capital. Earlier the same month, he said that [...] "due to {{dependence}} on deep tube wells, water layers in the city are dropping around three metres a year on average" [...] about the excessive use of underground water of the capital through around a thousand illegal deep tube wells, and filling up of low-lying land, canals and water bodies are causing the underground water level to drop alarmingly. Various researchers say that this could put the citizens in severe water crisis {{in the future and}} also cause land to subside. As a result, the capital braced for one of their history's worst water logging problems, that Abedin believed was resulted from unauthorised buildings being built on land filled up from ponds and lakes. He also brought attention to more than a 100,000 illegal links in the national water supply network which costs the nation around Tk 350 million a year.|$|E
30|$|Once captured, {{the fish}} must be handled {{as gently as}} possible, {{ensuring}} minimal contact with the skin. Scombrids lack the protection of large scales, and {{have a tendency to}} shed their scales when captured, which makes them more vulnerable to skin infections. When bracing the fish, for example, when heavy fish must be lifted to the boat, or when transferring the fish from the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> to the holding tank, it is often necessary to use PVC or vinyl slings covered with water based lubricant, which have shown to be effective and less harmful than nets or bare hands (Takashi 2014). Single barbless hooks are often used to facilitate fast hook removal. Releasing the hook is then performed using long nose pliers, a hook remover, or simply by placing the fish in the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> with no tension on the line, so the fish will un-hook itself.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{relatively}} safe, compact, efficient recharging of a high-pressure room-temperature gas supply has been proposed. In this method, the gas would be liquefied {{at the source}} for transport as a cryogenic fluid at or slightly above atmospheric pressure. Upon reaching the destination, a simple heating/expansion process {{would be used to}} (1) convert the transported cryogenic fluid to the room-temperature, high-pressure gaseous form in which it is intended to be utilized and (2) transfer the resulting gas to the storage tank of the system to be recharged. In conventional practice for recharging high-pressure-gas systems, gases are transported at room temperature in high-pressure tanks. For recharging a given system to a specified pressure, a <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> must contain the recharge gas at a much higher pressure. At the destination, the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> is connected to the system storage tank to be recharged, and the pressures in the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> and the system storage tank are allowed to equalize. One major disadvantage of the conventional approach is that the high transport pressure poses a hazard. Another disadvantage is the waste of a significant amount of recharge gas. Because the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> is disconnected from the system storage tank when it is at the specified system recharge pressure, the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> still contains a significant amount of recharge gas (typically on the order of half of the amount transported) that cannot be used. In the proposed method, the cryogenic fluid would be transported in a suitably thermally insulated tank that would be capable of withstanding the recharge pressure of the destination tank. The tank would be equipped with quick-disconnect fluid-transfer fittings and with a low-power electric heater (which would not be used during transport). In preparation for transport, a relief valve would be attached via one of the quick-disconnect fittings (see figure). During transport, the interior of the tank would be kept at a near-ambient pressure far below the recharge pressure. As leakage of heat into the tank caused vaporization of the cryogenic fluid, the resulting gas would be vented through the relief valve, which would be set to maintain the pressure in the <b>tank</b> at the <b>transport</b> value. Inasmuch as the density of a cryogenic fluid at atmospheric pressure greatly exceeds that of the corresponding gas in a practical high-pressure tank at room temperature, a <b>tank</b> for <b>transporting</b> a given mass of gas according to the proposed method could be smaller (and, hence, less massive) than is a <b>tank</b> needed for <b>transporting</b> the same mass of gas according to the conventional method...|$|R

50|$|The {{commissioning}} of the Newport-class in 1969 {{marked the}} introduction of an entirely new concept {{in the design of}} LSTs. She was the first of a new class of 20 LSTs capable of steaming at a sustained speed of 20 kn. To obtain that speed, the traditional blunt bow doors of the LST were replaced by a pointed ship bow. Unloading is accomplished {{through the use of a}} 112-foot (34 m) ramp operated over the bow and supported by twin derrick arms. A stern gate to the tank deck permits unloading of LVTs into the water or the unloading of other vehicles into a landing craft utility (LCU), onto a pier, or directly into the water. Capable of operating with high-speed amphibious squadrons consisting of LHAs, LPDs, and LSDs, the Newport-class LST can <b>transport</b> <b>tanks,</b> other heavy vehicles, and engineering equipment that cannot readily be landed by helicopters or landing craft. The Newport type has been removed from the U.S. Navy, and Spanish Navy, Chile and Malaysia but serves on in the navies of Brazil, Mexico, Morocco, Taiwan, in a modified form, Australia and soon with Peru. Indian Navy also maintains a fleet of LSTs.|$|E
30|$|Currently {{accepted}} {{methods for}} capture of live Scombrids focus mainly on rod and line fishing of individual fish. Once hooked, {{the fish are}} placed in round cornered <b>transport</b> <b>tanks,</b> which hold aerated seawater. The fish are then transferred to the holding tank at the research facility (Bourke et al. 1987; Sepulveda and Dickson 2000; Wexler et al. 2003). The use of commercial fishing vessels, capable of holding large <b>transport</b> <b>tanks</b> (larger than 5000  L), permits holding of greater numbers of fish (10 – 20, average size of fish 1.8  kg), for longer periods (up to 6  h), without causing stress and damage due to deteriorating water quality (Bourke et al. 1987). Alternatively, though small scale capture and transport of live yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{was reported to be}} more time consuming than using larger vessels and seine nets, it allowed careful handling of each individual fish, which resulted in up to 50  % of the fish surviving capture, handling and transport, and up to 30  % of them were healthy enough to become broodstock (Wexler et al. 2003). Reducing the time spent in the transport tank is crucial for the survival of the fish, especially when using small and medium volume <b>transport</b> <b>tanks</b> (Margulies et al. 2007).|$|E

30|$|Achieving higher {{survival}} rates through the implementations of the improvements and modifications discussed earlier could enable spending longer {{times on the}} water with fish in the tubes and thus, will increase the potential fishing area that can be utilized and number of fish that can be held {{before returning to the}} research facility. In addition, it will allow transport of bigger fish that are closer to sexual maturity, and will reduce the fattening time needed in the holding tank, thus becoming more applicable for time and budget restricted projects. Tuna tubes can also be utilized as an intermediate transport system, mounted on several small fishing vessels that capture the fish and transport them to a larger “mother ship” research vessel with larger <b>transport</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate a convenient, low-cost modification to conventional transfer methods for Atlantic halibut juveniles. A series of wire mesh cages were stacked within <b>transport</b> <b>tanks</b> creating a stratified transport system (STS), increasing the surface area for settlement and facilitating a more homogeneous distribution of halibut throughout the tank compared with the conventional insulated box (Unstructured, UTS). A stochastic cost-benefit analysis determined investment into a STS to be cost-effective, generating a mean benefit-cost ratio of 1. 31 (95 % CI, 0. 68 – 2. 00) after 2 years and a mean 5 -year net present value of 85, 176 (9546, 906 –$ 125, 630).

30|$|Additional {{measures}} {{could be}} taken to improve the fish survival, by maintaining low stress levels during transport. This can be achieved either by improving water quality parameters, providing oxygen and removing or neutralizing wastes, or by slowing down the fish metabolism, thereby reducing stress and reducing oxygen intake rate, wastes excretion and water acidification. Some possible methods to improve water quality parameters of the transport tank include the addition of ammonia quenchers, coupled with buffering agents to keep a stable pH and thus maintain low ammonia build-up (Correia et al. 2011). Others have suggested the use of immersion anaesthetics sedatives or cooling of the tank water by 5 – 10  °C as measures to slow down metabolic rates of the transported fish (Berka 1986; Rimmer and Franklin 1997; Harmon 2009). These practices however, are more applicable to closed and semi-enclosed <b>transport</b> <b>tanks,</b> which recirculates and reuse the treated water. These methods cannot {{be used in the}} case of tuna tubes, because of the high rate flow-through system they incorporate, meaning that any additives or modifiers introduced to the water will be diluted immediately.|$|E
