To represent the atmospheric evaporative demand, the original potential evaporation equation of Penman (1948) is utilized and then modified to include the effect of atmospheric stability using turbulent exchange coefficients formulated by Louis et al.

Using boundary layer data from the Wangara experiment (Clarke et al., 1971), the diurnal variations of the original and modified Penman equations are compared. The daily <b>total</b> potential <b>evaporation</b> using linearized and integrated forms of the original and modified expressions are also compared. Finally, the nonlinear effects of averaging both the original and modified expressions are examined.

The latent heat component of subsurface evaporation is estimated from the residual of the sensible heat balance. This heat balance method requires measurement of vertical soil temperature and estimates of thermal properties for soil water evaporation determination. Our objective was to employ numerically simulated thermal and hydraulic processes using constant or diurnally cycled surface boundary conditions to evaluate and understand this technique. Three observation grid spacings, namely, 6 mm (tri-needle HPP), 3 mm (penta-needle HPP) and 1 mm, along with three soil textures (sand, silt, and silty clay) were {{used to test the}} heat balance method. The comparison of heat balance–based evaporation rate estimates with an independent soil profile water balance revealed substantial errors when thermal conductivity was averaged spatially across the evaporation front. Since the conduction component of heat flux is the dominant process at the evaporation front, the estimation of evaporation rate was significantly improved using depth-dependent instead of a space-averaged. A near-surface “undetectable zone” exists, where the heat balance calculation is irreconcilable, resulting in underestimation of <b>total</b> subsurface <b>evaporation.</b> The method performs better for medium- and coarse-textured soils than for fine-textured soils, where portions of the drying front may be maintained longer within the undetectable zone.
