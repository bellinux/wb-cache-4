40|$|Welding is a {{key process}} for heavy steel {{structure}}s, {{but it is also}} a weak link in the structure since fatigue fractures in welds are a common cause of failure. This thesis proposes several changes in order to improve the fatigue properties in acost effective way, enabling reduced weight and reduced cost of welded structures. The main idea is to adapt the <b>weld</b> <b>requirements</b> and <b>welding</b> procedures to the load conditions of the weld. This approach ensures that the main focus in the welding process is the critical characteristics of the welds fatigue life properties. The fatigue life critical properties are most often related to the geometrical factors of the weld such as the radius at the weld toe or the penetration in the root. The thesis describes a holistic view of the subject and covers fatigue, <b>weld</b> quality, <b>weld</b> <b>requirements</b> and <b>welding</b> procedures. It becomes evident that the traditional way of working without a direct connection to fatigue is not the best. With an adaptation to the load conditions and fatigue, it is possible to enhance the fatigue life and reduce the welding cost. The main challenge is to connect the <b>welding</b> process, <b>weld</b> <b>requirements</b> and fatigue life properties. It is needed for an optimised welding process of heavy structures subjected to fatigue and toget a predictable fatigue life. Welds optimised for enhanced fatigue life properties are not necessary accepted according to the requirements in a current standard. Several welding procedures are proposed for improving the fatigue life properties of the weld, which indicate a high potential for enhanced fatigue lifeof fillet welds. The idea is to replace the "standard" fillet weld with three different weld types: (i) Welds with deep penetration, (ii) Welds with large weld toe radius and (iii) Welds produced with low cost. Together with customised requirements and reduced over-welding there is a vast potential for reduced weight, reduced cost and increased productivity. The main contribution of this thesis work is the cross-functional studies including design, analysis, production and quality control. This gives a framework for improvements supporting reduced cost and reduced weight of VIII welded structures without reducing the fatigue strength. Many shortcomings have been highlighted to change the welding from a state where welds are done in a way as they "always" have, by tradition, to a more contemporary situation where <b>weld</b> <b>requirements</b> and <b>welding</b> procedures are actively chosen to match the load conditions of the weld. This result in <b>requirements</b> and <b>welding</b> procedures which actually are connected to the fatigue properties as defined by the loading conditions, and where auditors with high probability can say that an accepted weld actually is better than a rejected weld...|$|R

It explains the thermal-mechanical coupling mechanism between the welding tool and the workpiece, presents simulation of the heat distribution on a friction stir weld spindle under specific welding technology parameters, and provides the type selection and the reference design for temperature-sensitive components such as bearings and motor. The spindle system, which has high stiffness and excellent resistance to overload, is developed in accordance with the <b>welding</b> <b>requirement</b> for aluminum alloy products in the aeronautic and astronautic fields. The thermal-mechanical coupling model is established between the stir-pin and the workpiece. The heat generation and transfer processes are simulated, and the results of the temperature field distribution for the target position inside the spindle structure are obtained and verified by experiments. Test results show that the spindle system can meet the requirements of friction stir welding for large-scale complex surface structures. Simulation analysis has good consistency with experimental results, as proved by experimental verification. The resulting data can provide reliable reference design and type selection of temperature-sensitive components.

40|$|Master of ScienceArchitectural Engineering and Construction ScienceDonald J. PhillippiSpecial steel moment {{frames are}} one of the most common systems used to resist high seismic forces. Well-proportioned moment {{resisting}} connections are essential. Special steel moment frame connections must be capable of transferring moment and shear forces that are developed in the beams to the column. These connections must be designed as a highly ductile element in order to dissipate extensive energy thus undergo inelastic deformations. Doubler plates and continuity plates have been recommended by several design codes and standards in order to strengthen the column web and prevent the inelastic deformation of the panel zone due to high shear stress concentrations. However, doubler plates and continuity plates are very expensive due to the large amount of detailing and <b>welding</b> <b>requirements.</b> Furthermore, the extensive welding may affect the properties of the steel in which it may cause shrinkage, lower potential notch toughness and cracking.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS, including super duplex {{stainless steels}} {SDSS}) {{have proven to}} be very useful engineering materials, albeit with somewhat different <b>welding</b> <b>requirements</b> than those of the more familiar austenitic stainless steels. Despite a generally good track record in welding of duplex stainless steels, certain pitfalls have been encountered with enough frequency that they deserve review. Inappropriate base metal specification often leads to unsuitable heat affected zone (HAZ) properties. Autogenous fusion zones are also of concern. This issue centers around nitrogen limits. The most frequently encountered is applying the UNS S 31803 composition for 2205 DSS, instead of the S 32205 composition. Inappropriate welding heat input arises most frequently with SDSS. While 0. 5 to 1. 5 kJ/mm is a normal heat input recommendation for SDSS, either a root pass or many small beads towards the low end of this heat input range tends to result in precipitation and/or secondary austenite formation in weld metal subjected to repeated thermal cycles from multiple weld passes. Inappropriate PWHT occurs when the enhanced nickel filler metals (typically 9 % Ni) are used. DSS are not normally given PWHT, but extensive forming of heads, for example, or repair welding of castings, may require a postweld anneal. Specifications such as ASTM A 790 and A 890 call for annealing at 1040 ºC minimum, and the fabricator tends to use temperatures close to that minimum. However, the enhanced nickel filler metals require higher temperatures to dissolve sigma phase that forms during heating to the annealing temperature...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This thesis {{details the}} {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} fixture-based, reconfigurable, automated spot welding system aimed at manufacturing various sub-assemblies of circuit breakers. The welding operations are currently done using manual welding equipment, making {{this stage of the}} assembly process highly labour intensive. A range of product models and variants are assembled in quantities requiring frequent change-overs. Low-cost automation within a developing country’s manufacturing industry, more specifically within the Republic of South Africa, is the target context. The chosen design restriction, of incorporating a part fixturing design approach, distinguishes this research from F. S. D. Dymond’s work, who addressed the same problem while restricted to a fixtureless assembly approach. A conceptual layout design was developed to address part feeding, manipulation, transportation, fixturing and <b>welding</b> <b>requirements,</b> for an entire breaker model range. A simulation model for three possible layouts of the selected conceptual design provided a means to investigate each layout’s ability to tolerate and balance variation in production requirements, and to establish objective comparative performance data. This showed that the optimal configuration consists of four single loop layout systems. The thesis concludes that the final concept possesses the flexibility to produce the primary product range. Reconfiguration for production beyond this range is assisted by the modular nature of the layout. Ultimately, a reconfigurable design should focus on a properly selected base of core product ranges, providing an expandable and reusable system. The system can be supported by manual assembly stations which handle highly variant, incompatible product ranges...|$|R
40|$|Construction of reliable, {{economically}} feasible and ice-capable vessels and structures for the Arctic {{has been a}} subject of great interest in recent years, {{in spite of the}} concerns that the undertaking clearly faces profound technical difficulties. One of the technical challenges for modern Arctic shipbuilding is to produce high-quality welds, {{due to the fact that}} a weld is usually the weakest part of any structure. Welding is especially difficult for the high strength steels (HSS), which are used in shipbuilding for weight-reduction purposes. The submerged arc welding (SAW) process is one of the most commonly applied welding processes in shipbuilding, because of its high productivity and the outstanding quality of the resultant welds. The objective of the thesis is to explore the usability, development possibilities and parameters of high deposition rate SAW processes and their modifications for welding of thick cold-resistant HSS plates typically used in Arctic shipbuilding applications. Meeting this objective required in-depth understanding of the welding and material science background, which includes the quality <b>requirements</b> of <b>welded</b> joints intended for Arctic service as described in various standards (ISO 19906; ASME 31. 3; Norsok M- 001 and Russian Maritime Register of Shipping), properties of cold-resistant HSS and description of testing methods used to validate welding joints for low temperature conditions. The thesis is based on two research methods: literature review and experimental work. The SAW process and <b>welding</b> <b>requirements,</b> cold-resistant HSS and the Arctic operating conditions and challenges from the engineering perspective are first studied. A literature review of materials and <b>welding</b> <b>requirements</b> for Arctic applications according to various standards, experimental testing of advanced SAW processes and assessment of their suitability for application to Arctic conditions, examination of the effects of the SAW process on HSS for Arctic service, and a proposed suitable range of parameters for welding HSS for Arctic conditions was carried out. Based on this analysis, it became possible to design and conduct experiments to present new experimental data that improve understanding of SAW process and its modifications to weld thick quenched and tempered (QT) and thermo-mechanically processed (TMCP) HSS plates. Experiments were conducted to develop high deposition rate SAW welding procedures of modified SAW (conventional single wire, tandem wire welding, and three-wire and four-wire arrangements) to weld several thick (12 – 35 mm) high strength (580 – 650 MPa tensile strength) cold-resistant (intended operational temperature - 40 °C ~ - 60 °C) steel grades, i. e. E 500, F 500 W, X 70 and AB 2. The welds were evaluated by a wide range of industrial tests: analyses of chemical, microstructural and mechanical properties; hardness tests; and cold resistance evaluation tests: the Charpy V-notch impact test, the Nil-ductility transition temperature (NDT) test, the three-point bending (Tkb) test and the Crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) test. Acceptable welding parameters and recommendations were developed, and the results of the experiments show that highquality welds can be obtained using heat input up to 3. 5 kJ/mm. This thesis provides a practical approach and clarifies the difficulties to SAW process parameter selection for welding thick HSS plates intended for Arctic shipbuilding applications. The experimental results can be directly adapted to industrial applications, and the theoretical observations can be used to gain deeper understanding of state-of-theart of SAW processes and its novel developments...|$|R

It comprises the ultrasonic transducer (probe) built {{into one of the}} welding electrodes and an electronics hardware unit which gathers information from the transducer, performs real-time weld quality characterization and communicates with the robot programmable logic controller (PLC). The system has been fully developed for the inspection of spot welds manufactured in steel alloys, and has been mainly applied in the automotive industry. In recent years, a variety of materials have been introduced to the automotive industry. These include high strength steels, magnesium alloys, and aluminum alloys. Aluminum alloys have been of particular interest due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. Resistance spot <b>welding</b> <b>requirements</b> for aluminum vary greatly from those of steel. Additionally, the oxide film formed on the aluminum surface increases the heat generation between the copper electrodes and the aluminum plates leading to accelerated electrode deterioration. Preliminary studies showed that the real-time quality inspection system was not able to monitor spot welds manufactured with aluminum. The extensive experimental research, finite element modelling of the aluminum welding process and finite difference modeling of the acoustic wave propagation through the aluminum spot welds presented in this dissertation, revealed that the thermodynamics and hence the acoustic wave propagation through an aluminum and a steel spot weld differ significantly. For this reason, the hardware requirements and the algorithms developed to determine the welds quality from the ultrasonic data used on steel, no longer apply on aluminum spot welds. After updating the system and designing the required algorithms, parameters such as liquid nugget penetration and nugget diameter were available in the ultrasonic data acquired during the aluminum welding process. Finally, a fuzzy system was designed to receive these parameters and determine the weld quality...|$|R
