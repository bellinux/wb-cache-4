5|$|A {{second book}} titled Unearthed Arcana was {{produced}} by Wizards of the Coast for Dungeons & Dragons third edition in 2004. The designers did not reproduce material from the original book, but instead attempted to emulate its purpose by providing variant rules and options to change <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Blizzard Entertainment geoblocked a tie-in web comic for its game Overwatch in Russia for {{containing}} {{a scene of}} the character Tracer, who was confirmed as being lesbian, kissing another woman. Blizzard cited the gay propaganda law as reasoning for the block. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> is not blocked in the country.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theme song}} of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> is [...] "Sukma Dua Belas Terengganu 2008" [...] (<b>The</b> 12th Sukma <b>Games</b> Terengganu 2008), a song name after <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|R

50|$|On later {{cartridge}}-based console games, such as Kirby's Adventure and The Legend of Zelda, saved {{games were}} stored in battery-backed RAM on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> cartridge <b>itself.</b> In recent consoles, which use disc-based media for storing games, saved games {{are stored in}} other ways, such as by use of memory cards or internal hard drives on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> machine <b>itself.</b>|$|R
5|$|Outside of the tournament's games, {{other related}} {{competitions}} were held, including a Dota 2-themed short film contest and a cosplay competition, with each having their own independent winners and prize pools. In addition, two new playable characters for <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> were revealed during the event, {{with the latter}} also featuring an accompanying martial arts performance.|$|E
5|$|Terrence Pegula, {{who would}} go on to {{purchase}} the Sabres three years later, was among those in attendance. Also in attendance was game show host Pat Sajak, who spoke positively of his experience (although admitting that Ralph Wilson Stadium's size was somewhat of a distraction from <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dissidia Final Fantasy Original Soundtrack by Takeharu Ishimoto was {{released}} on December 24, 2008, and is available in both regular and special editions, similar to <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself.</b> Most tracks are often remixes done by Ishimoto of past Final Fantasy music originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu.|$|E

50|$|On {{occasion}} (and regularly during preseason games), WKBD produced broadcasts of Detroit Lions football games, {{as well as}} Detroit Pistons basketball <b>games,</b> until <b>the</b> late 1980s {{when the}} Pistons decided to produce and distribute <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>itself,</b> with WKBD responsible for advertising. Both teams' games were simulcast {{on a handful of}} other stations across Michigan.|$|R
5|$|The {{story of}} Brood War is {{presented}} through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission, and conversations within the missions themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cut scenes {{at the end of each}} campaign. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> is split into three new episodes, one centering on each race.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had {{less to do with}} <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2014, the NFL {{announced}} that Perry would {{perform at the}} Super Bowl XLIX halftime show on February 1, 2015. Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott served as special guests for the show. Two days after the halftime show, the Guinness World Records {{announced that}} Perry's performance garnered 118.5 million viewers in the United States, and became the most watched and highest rated show in Super Bowl history. The viewership was higher than <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself,</b> which was viewed by an audience of 114.4 million.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of Spec Ops: The Line {{were mostly}} positive, with many critics praising the narrative, themes, and the provocative take on {{violence}} in video games, but {{noted that it}} failed to innovate or present a strong multiplayer component. Many critics consider the game to be underrated, or overlooked. Previews of the game, as well as <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself,</b> were banned in the United Arab Emirates for the depiction of Dubai {{in a state of}} destruction.|$|E
5|$|The first {{teaser trailer}} was shown at E3 2005, {{depicting}} Dante traveling through a snow-covered environment. A more substantial trailer was released at that year's Tokyo Game Show, {{with a more}} rugged and older Dante in a city-like setting. Both teasers show very little detail of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself.</b> At the 2006 Tokyo Game Show, a more complete trailer debuted, along with a playable demo, featuring the character Nero.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> {{continued}} to evolve during this time. Numerous innovations {{to the rules}} and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought to improve {{the flow of the}} game and make the sport more fan-friendly. The NHL played with six men to a side rather than the traditional seven, and was among the first leagues to allow goaltenders to leave their feet to make saves. The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> cover <b>itself</b> is {{a parody}} of Army of Darkness, with Duke posing as Ash Williams.|$|R
50|$|Besides some rule {{differences}} listed above, some versions label differently {{the names}} of characters, weapons, rooms {{and in some instances}} <b>the</b> actual <b>game</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> {{was closely}} contested. Staubach {{completed}} 25 passes, but also threw two interceptions. Late {{in the fourth}} quarter, Navy took the lead, 22–21. With less than three minutes remaining, the Midshipmen kicked off and halfback Ken Ambrusko fielded the ball from the Terrapins' endzone. Ambrusko returned it 101 yards for a touchdown, and Maryland won the game, 27–22.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory in}} the 2006 Gator Bowl had {{far-reaching}} effects for both the Hokies and the Louisville Cardinals. The win pushed Tech to 11–2 on the season, while the Cardinals' loss ensured they ended the 2005 season with a 9–3 overall record. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> provided more than $14million in economic benefit to the Jacksonville area as Louisville and Virginia Tech fans flocked to the region, spending money on food, hotel rooms, transportation, and entertainment.|$|E
5|$|A 50-point sophomore season earned Phaneuf {{his first}} NHL All-Star Game {{appearance}} in 2006–07. He {{participated in the}} hardest shot competition at the SuperSkills competition, losing to Zdeno Chára, and scored a goal and an assist in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> to help the Western Conference defeat the East 12–9. The Flames signed Phaneuf to a six-year, US$39 million contract extension midway through the 2007–08 season. He responded by posting a career-high 60 points, and was voted into the starting line-up by the fans for the 2008 All-Star Game. Phaneuf {{was named to the}} NHL First All-Star Team following the season, and was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as defenceman of the year, losing to the Detroit Red Wings' Nicklas Lidström.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} type of cheat code is one created by <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{designers}} and hidden within <b>the</b> video <b>game</b> <b>itself,</b> {{that will cause}} any type of uncommon effect that {{is not part of}} <b>the</b> usual <b>game</b> mechanics.|$|R
50|$|Within <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> terminology, belote {{is used to}} {{designate}} a pair of a King and a Queen of a trump suit, possibly yielding <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> name <b>itself.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although logically <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{should be}} called [...] "Snits' [...] Revenge", the apostrophisation used {{in this article is}} in accord with that used on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> box <b>itself.</b>|$|R
5|$|Additional {{downloadable}} content (DLC) {{has been}} released, with more announced, since the game's launch. Expansions include new maps, weapon upgrades and character customization options. The DualShock 3 controller became {{compatible with the}} game upon {{the release of the}} version 1.20 patch. Incognito has stated that any future development on the incomplete single player campaign would only be released as a separate product, and not as an expansion to the current game. Warhawk updates are free, but expansion packs are sold online for a price. Updates are mandatory installations that must be completed in order to play the game. Expansion packs are optional, and the ability to purchase expansion packs is available within the menu of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself,</b> as well as through the PlayStation Store.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier. The staff numbers, including those working on the cutscenes, went from around one hundred for Path of Radiance to around 200 for Radiant Dawn: half the staff worked on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself,</b> while the other half worked on the cutscenes. For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from Path of Radiance the developers felt was wrong. All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E
5|$|Bošković's {{injury was}} {{released}} publicly on 1 May, {{only three days}} before their midweek fixture against Seattle Sounders FC. D.C. United, who had never defeated Seattle at home, was coming off a two-match winning streak. The match ended in United's favor, as goals from Josh Wolff and Charlie Davies helped United earn a 2–1 victory. Playing their third match within a week, United hosted 2010 MLS Cup-finalists, FC Dallas on 7 May. Like United, Dallas was suffering from a slew of injuries, most notably forward David Ferreira who broke his ankle in Dallas' 2–1 away victory at Vancouver. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>itself</b> ended in a scoreless tie, though United out shot Dallas 5–2 in total shots on frame.|$|E
