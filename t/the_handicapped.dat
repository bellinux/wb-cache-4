5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to <b>the</b> <b>handicapped.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pat Nixon became {{involved}} in the development of recreation areas and parkland, {{was a member of the}} President's Committee on Employment of <b>the</b> <b>Handicapped,</b> and lent her support to organizations dedicated to improving the lives of handicapped children. For her first Thanksgiving in the White House, Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families. The following year, she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House. Though presidents since George Washington had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations, Pat became the only First Lady to issue one.|$|E
5|$|The GDR emblem {{was removed}} from over the main {{entrance}} in 1990, the year of reunification, leaving a dark patch. Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished {{to use it for}} its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under the GDR, upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated in part to the 1920s. Access also needed to be provided for <b>the</b> <b>handicapped.</b>|$|E
50|$|At five Princess Doreen won <b>the</b> Inaugural <b>Handicap</b> and <b>the</b> Saratoga <b>Handicap.</b> In <b>the</b> Saratoga <b>Handicap</b> {{she beat}} two-time Horse of the Year, Sarazen. She placed in <b>the</b> Grainger Memorial <b>Handicap,</b> <b>the</b> Independence <b>Handicap,</b> <b>the</b> Bowie <b>Handicap,</b> <b>the</b> Pimlico Serial and was {{third in the}} Pimlico Cup and the Saratoga Cup. In her final season she won <b>the</b> Independence <b>Handicap,</b> placed in <b>the</b> Hotel Statler <b>Handicap,</b> and was third in <b>the</b> Lincoln <b>Handicap</b> and <b>the</b> Oak Park <b>Handicap.</b>|$|R
40|$|An ESS {{model of}} Zahavi's {{handicap}} principle is constructed. This allows a formal exposition of how <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle works, and shows that its essential elements are strategic. <b>The</b> <b>handicap</b> model is about signalling, {{and it is}} proved under fairly general conditions that if <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle's conditions are met, then an evolutionarily stable signalling equilibrium exists in a biological signalling system, and that any signalling equilibrium satisfies the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle. Zahavi's major claims for <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle are thus vindicated. The place of cheating is discussed {{in view of the}} honesty that follows from <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle. Parallel signalling models in economics are discussed. Interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle are compared. The models are not fully explicit about how females use information about male quality, and, less seriously, have no genetics. A companion paper remedies both defects in a model of <b>the</b> <b>handicap</b> principle at work in sexual selection...|$|R
5000|$|At five: Won <b>the</b> Black Helen <b>Handicap,</b> {{placed in}} <b>the</b> Vanity <b>Handicap</b> and <b>the</b> Columbiana <b>Handicap,</b> and was third in <b>the</b> Premiere <b>Handicap</b> and <b>the</b> Vineland <b>Handicap.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers made {{a notable}} move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who {{came back from}} the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. Chamberlain {{averaged}} 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists, once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury, <b>the</b> <b>handicapped</b> Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor, and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals. Winning the regular season with 66 wins, the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers; still, many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22, and the Bucks won 106–85. In Game 2, the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points, four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson, West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory, but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was not only 10 years younger, but healthy.|$|E
