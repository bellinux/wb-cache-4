2500|$|Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two {{men were}} very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an {{impeccable}} literary taste. In An Uncommon Story he wrote: [...] "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, Oblomov will be remembered... Another <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, this Italianate brick {{row house}} at 1524 Hollins Street {{was the home}} of one of Baltimore’s most famous {{citizens}} – noted Baltimore Sun journalist and author Henry Louis Mencken lived here from 1883 {{until his death in}} 1956. Mencken wrote of his home: “I have lived in one house in Baltimore for nearly 45 years. It has changed in that <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have – but somehow it still remains the same.... It {{is as much a part}} of me as my two hands. If I had to leave it I’d be as certainly crippled as if I lost a leg.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with Access Hollywood, Cage denied this allegation, stating that [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I {{resigned from the}} movie because I didn't think I {{had enough time to}} achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do." [...] When first approached for the lead role, Rourke was initially reluctant, stating that [...] "I didn't really care for the script, but I wanted to work with Darren and I kind of thought that whoever wrote the script hadn't spent as much <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had around these kind of people and he wouldn't have spoken the way the dude was speaking. And, so Darren let me rewrite all my parts and he put the periods in and crossed the T's. So once we made that change I was okay with it." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stanley was {{apparently}} very comfortable. He was smoking {{one of my}} best cigars, and a whisky and soda stood at his elbow. He looked up from behind the <b>Times</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> entered.|$|R
60|$|These things terrified {{the people}} to the last degree, and {{especially}} when two or three <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have mentioned already, they found one {{or two in the}} bills dead of the plague at St Giles's.|$|R
6000|$|Upon that fabric fair [...] "Here is she!" [...] Seems written {{everywhere}} [...] Unto me. But {{to friends}} and nodding neighbours, Fellow-wights in lot and labours, Who descry the <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>I,</b> No such lucid legend tells [...] Where she dwells.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the urging}} of his supporters, Miller never {{personally}} set an exact date for the expected Second Advent. [...] However, in response to their urgings he did narrow the time-period to sometime in the year 1843, stating: [...] "My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844" [...] March 21, 1844 passed without incident, {{and the majority of}} Millerites maintained their faith. On March 25, Miller wrote to Himes, [...] "I am still looking for the Dear Savior…. The <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have calculated it, is now filled up; and I expect every moment to see the Savior descend from heaven. I have now nothing to look for but this glorious hope." ...|$|E

60|$|As I {{rose above}} the city <b>I</b> circled several <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had seen Kantos Kan do, and then {{throwing}} my engine into top speed I raced at terrific velocity toward the south, following {{one of the great}} waterways which enter Zodanga from that direction.|$|R
2500|$|In court, Cottrell {{testified that}} after he drove Phillips around Elizabethtown looking for a job, Phillips came into his motel room uninvited, tried to kiss him, and {{attempted}} to force him into oral sex. Cottrell then put Phillips in a headlock, pulled {{him to the floor}} and [...] "started hitting him <b>as</b> hard <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, <b>as</b> many <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could." ...|$|R
60|$|The crop {{that year}} was enormous. At <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{looked out over}} the {{billowing}} acres of wheat which must not only be reaped and bound and shocked and stacked but also threshed, before there was the slightest chance of my returning to the Seminary, my face grew long and my heart heavy.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{were best}} for you, therefore, to accept my hospitality, till such <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can send {{you and your}} ladies on to Bruges." ...|$|E
60|$|And all the <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{afterward}} learned, his will, {{drawn up}} by Carruthers, and making me sole beneficiary, lay in the American consul's safe.|$|E

6000|$|... “What! old Leather-Stocking,” he cried, “grumbling at {{the loss}} of a few pigeons! If you had to sow your wheat twice, and three <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have done, you wouldn’t be so massyfully feeling toward the divils. Hurrah, boys! scatter the feathers! This is better than {{shooting}} at a turkey’s head and neck, old fellow.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon. Some bodies lose their wits, like your friend Aubrey, who tells me, {{if he had}} stood still, he would have fainted away. As long as nerves can do what comes to hand, they need not be blamed, even if they play {{troublesome}} tricks at other <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> suspect they are doing now.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} the game well enough, though I pretended I did not, and played cautiously. It {{was to keep}} a good stock in my lap, out of which I {{every now and then}} conveyed some into my pocket, but in such a manner, and at such convenient <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was sure he could not see it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{have been}} meaning to come a long <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> knew you'd like to have me, Uncle Benjy; and 'tisn't in my heart to refuse you.' ...|$|E
60|$|All this {{flashed through}} my anguished mind in one brief throb of <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> waited, marvelling {{what he would}} do, what say, in answer to that dismissal.|$|E

6000|$|No one else, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> knew, was {{transmitting}} this Coast {{life into}} literature. Edwin Markham was an Oakland school teacher, Frank Norris, a college student, and Jack London {{a boy in}} short trousers. Miller dominated the coast landscape. The mountains, the streams, the pines were his. A dozen <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> passed some splendid peak I quoted his lines. [...] "Sierras! Eternal tents of snow that flash o'er battlements of mountains." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the second}} time, I {{went to the}} door; and, for the second <b>time,</b> try <b>as</b> <b>I</b> might, I couldn't cross the threshold.|$|R
5000|$|Admirers of {{the novel}} {{included}} T. E. Lawrence, who found that [...] "Parts of the book come back to my memory without warning at odd <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> lie about brooding. The Greece part, especially. You get a tense effect out of quite simple words," [...] he wrote to Lucas. [...] "Somehow actual sentences have stuck to me". Lucas dedicated his next novel, Cécile (1930), to Lawrence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll take rooms," [...] was the reply, [...] "and I shall {{spend as}} much <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can with you in London. You want looking after, my son; I've heard all about you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is a warm evening. [...] . Yes, and I {{have been}} {{thinking}} of old <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> walked along,' she said, 'and how people's positions in life alter.

50|$|I {{feel all}} things as dynamic events, being, changing, and {{interacting}} {{with each other}} in space and <b>time</b> even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> photograph them.|$|R

60|$|Well, mother, I believe I {{will not}} {{fill out the}} sheet this <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{want to go down}} without delay to the P. O. and send George's letter and this one. Good-bye, dear mother.|$|E
