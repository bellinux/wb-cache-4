5|$|Because of his father's background, Thakkar's {{early years}} in India were spent around actors. During <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, {{contributing}} to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant. Later on, {{he moved to the}} United States as he believed it was easier to make visual effects movies in Hollywood. Currently, Thakkar stays with his wife and family in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Beyond <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles {{himself by}} {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Kutuzov {{was very}} {{strongly}} {{concerned that the}} French might take the New Smolensk Road around his positions and on to Moscow so placed the more powerful 1stArmy under Barclay on the right, in positions which were already strong and virtually unassailable by the French. The 2ndArmy under Bagration was expected to hold the left. The fall of Shevardino unanchored the Russian left flank but Kutuzov did nothing to change <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> dispositions despite the repeated pleas of his generals to redeploy their forces.|$|E

5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|After <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. <b>These</b> <b>initial</b> subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{proximity}} to trade routes {{in and around}} the Central Valley, the Wintu came into frequent contact with European explorers, traders and settlers. <b>These</b> <b>initial</b> meetings were peaceful, but the Wintu population – along with many other Central Valley tribes – were decimated by a malaria epidemic in the 1830s, accidentally introduced by Hudson's Bay Company fur trappers. In the following decades the remaining Wintu became embroiled in conflict as prospectors and settlers occupied their traditional lands. Some of these conflicts ended in deadly massacres. In 1846, one of the bloodiest single encounters occurred when soldiers led by John C. Frémont killed 175 Wintu, Maidu and Yana. In 1850 about 100 Trinity Wintu perished after being given poisoned food by white settlers. By 1910 the Wintu population had been reduced to about 1,000, from an estimated 12,000 prior to European contact.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. <b>These</b> <b>initial</b> investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E
5|$|In North America, King Kong grossed $9,755,745 {{during its}} Wednesday opening and $50,130,145 over its first weekend for a five-day total of $66.1 million.

The film grossed an additional $332,437,332 in the international box office for a worldwide total of $550,517,357, which not only ranked it in the top five highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, but also helped the film bring back more than {{two and a half times}} its production budget.|$|E
5000|$|Although coastal Min {{varieties}} can {{be derived}} from a proto-language with four series of stop or affricate initials at each point of articulation (e.g. , , [...] and [...] ), Northern Min varieties contain traces of two further series, one voiced and the other voiceless.In Northern Min dialects, <b>these</b> <b>initials</b> have a different tonal development from other stops and affricates, though the details vary between varieties.Moreover, although in Jian'ou and Zhenghe <b>these</b> <b>initials</b> yield voiceless unaspirated initials (as in coastal varieties), they yield voiced sonorants or the zero initial in Jianyang and Wuyishan.Because of these reflexes, Jerry Norman called <b>these</b> <b>initials</b> [...] "softened" [...] stops and affricates.|$|R
25|$|<b>These</b> <b>initials</b> must {{therefore}} be distinguished in proto-Min as aspirated and unaspirated voiced consonants.|$|R

5|$|In late-May {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist roughly 650km (400mi) west of Manila, Philippines in the South China Sea. Late on May23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the area for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis. Over {{the next few days}} the disturbance began to consolidate towards a common low pressure center, resulting in a burst in convective activity. At 0000UTC on May25, the JTWC classified the resulting system as a tropical depression west of Luzon; six hours later both the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) began to monitor the newly formed tropical cyclone, though the latter classified it as a tropical storm. During <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> stages of development the tropical cyclone slowly intensified as it slowly tracked in a clockwise loop throughout the course of the day. At 1800UTC, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status while the JMA followed suit six hours later, thus designating the cyclone with the name Linfa.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October 1941 (15 October, {{according}} to other sources), the Wehrmacht resumed its offensive. At first, the German forces attempted to bypass Soviet defenses by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin and south towards Kaluga and Tula, capturing all except Tula by 14 October. Encouraged by <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> successes, the Germans launched a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, Naro-Fominsk on 21 October, and Volokolamsk on 27 October after intense fighting. Because {{of the increasing}} danger of flanking attacks, Zhukov was forced to fall back, withdrawing his forces east of the Nara River.|$|E
5|$|State {{highways}} {{were first}} formally {{defined by the}} state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations, although <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern Route22 were defined as part of legislative routes1 and 22. Legislative route1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to Armonk (via modern NY120). Legislative route1 continued north along modern NY22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern NY203 and NY980B), then followed US9 to Albany. Legislative route22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following NY7 to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).|$|E

5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their initial seasons, they struggled financially. A key event in franchise history occurred in the 11th game of the Giants inaugural season. The Chicago Bears, led by star running back Red Grange, came to town attracting a then pro football record 73,000 fans, and giving the Giants a much needed financial influx. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. After <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> struggles, the Giants financial status stabilized, and they {{led the league in}} attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s. By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continue to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue {{for the benefit of the}} entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.|$|E

5|$|Australian airmen were {{involved}} in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No.464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night. While No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No.460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included {{at least one of the}} RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK. No.464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>these</b> <b>initial</b> {{developments}} the Depression in {{the early}} 1930s largely halted the development of armour in Australia, although a limited capability was maintained by the regular tank cadre which operated mainly in an instructional role. The 1st Tank Section was disbanded in November 1937 with the men and equipment transferred to the newly created 1st Light Tank Company based at Randwick. It was not the Australian Army's only armoured unit as the Second World War approached. The 2nd Light Tank Company was formed as a Militia unit at Caulfield, Victoria in March 1939 and was also equipped with Vickers Medium Mark II medium tanks. The light tank companies were then equipped with the Light Tank Mark VIa, 10 {{of which had been}} acquired to replace the ageing Mark IIs. In addition, the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers, which had been serving as a Light Horse regiment, having converted from horses to armoured vehicles to become a light cavalry (reconnaissance) regiment and took on the role of a motorised machine-gun regiment during the inter-war years. It subsequently saw action in the Second World War as the 1st Armoured Regiment equipped with Matilda infantry tanks.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{began to}} {{experience}} the effects of Amara on December20, when strong gusts caused by the tropical cyclone swept across the island. <b>These</b> <b>initial</b> winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, resulting in power outage. At the height of power outages, over 12,000households were without power, primarily in Port Sud-Est, Mount Lubin, and Rivière-Cocos. By the afternoon of December22, only 20%of homes had access to electricity. Some of the fallen trees rendered roads impassable. Heavy rains caused some creeks to overflow their banks, and riffles became impassable. The rainfall also caused extensive soil erosion. Amara also triggered a strong storm surge, resulting in coastal flooding. Despite the heavy rainfall, total precipitation amounts remained relatively low, peaking at 78mm (3.07in) in Citronelle. On December21, a wind gust of 152km/h (94mph) {{was reported in the}} locality of Pointe Canon, which was the highest wind measurement recorded in associated with Amara. Another station at Sir Gaëtan Duval Airport reported a similarly strong wind gust clocked at 135km/h (84mph). The strong winds tore metal sheets off of buildings and cut telecommunications between Rodrigues {{and the rest of the}} world. Despite the widespread precautionary measures taken beforehand, Port Mathurin suffered marginal impacts. Following the storm, local police groups and the Special Mobile Force were mobilized in order to assist in relief efforts. Technicians from the Mauritius Central Electricity Board were dispatched to resolve power issues.|$|E
