5|$|After the election, the Conservative {{party were}} charged with {{improper}} election spending, {{in a case that}} became known as the In and Out scandal. It dragged on for years, but in 2012 <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> plea deal, admitting both improper spending and falsifying records to hide it.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men {{set out on}} late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> position on the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E
5|$|After {{their victory}} over Marion, the Informals {{defeated}} the Cadets {{for the second}} consecutive week at Denny Stadium 19–13. After <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 7–0 lead on an 85-yard drive, the Cadets extended it to 13–0 {{by the end of the}} first quarter when Jimmy Scruggs scored on a touchdown reception. The Informals responded with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns to make the halftime score 13–12. Touchdowns were scored on a Frank MacAlpine run and on a 21-yard Whitey Blanchiak reception from Barton Greer. Alabama then scored the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter on a 55-yard interception return for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|In early September, Confederate and Union forces entered Kentucky, ending her neutrality. On September 18, Unionists {{shut down}} the pro-Southern Louisville Courier {{newspaper}} and arrested former governor Charles S. Morehead, who was suspected of having Confederate sympathies. Learning that Colonel Thomas E. Bramlette was under orders to arrest him, Breckinridge fled to Prestonsburg, Kentucky, where he was joined by Confederate sympathizers George W. Johnson, George Baird Hodge, William E. Simms, and William Preston. The group continued to Abingdon, Virginia, where <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> train to Confederate-held Bowling Green, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season without Johnson, the team won 43 games {{to earn the}} eight seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The Lakers became the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 lead versus Phoenix. They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime. Following the season head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B.

Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E

5|$|This {{left the}} Australian {{captaincy}} open again. Harvey started the season strongly and scored 326 runs {{in his first}} three innings. This included 160 against Queensland and 149 for his new state against the touring England team of Peter May. In this match, Benaud had captained New South Wales and the hosts had the better of the play. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 214-run first innings lead and May's men when 6/356 when time ran out.|$|E
5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a follow-up to Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> great deal of interest in production. He said it also enabled them to work at their own pace, hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, {{was inspired by the}} streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> holiday {{in the south of}} France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing. Doyle, returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of Australia, received the news in Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.|$|E

5|$|In March, the pro-German Yugoslav {{government}} was toppled. A furious Hitler ordered the attack to {{be expanded to}} include Yugoslavia. Operation Marita commenced on 7 April. The Luftwaffe committed StG 1, 2 and 77 to the campaign. The Stuka once again spearheaded the air assault, with a front line strength of 300 machines, against minimal Yugoslav resistance in the air, allowing the Stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region. Operating unmolested, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> heavy toll of ground forces, suffering only light losses to ground fire. The effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in just ten days. The Stukas also took a peripheral part in Operation Punishment, Hitler's retribution bombing of Belgrade. The dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti-aircraft gun positions whilst the level bombers struck civilian targets. Belgrade was badly damaged, with 2,271 people reported killed and 12,000 injured.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, the February Revolution {{broke out}} in Petrograd as {{industrial}} workers went on strike over food shortages and deteriorating factory conditions. The unrest spread {{to other parts of}} Russia, and fearing that he would be violently overthrown, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. The State Duma took over control of the country, establishing a Provisional Government. When Lenin learned of this from his base in Switzerland, he celebrated with other dissidents, and immediately sent advice to the Bolsheviks in Russia. He decided to return to Russia to take charge of the Bolsheviks there, but found that most passages into the country were blocked due to the ongoing First World War, which the Provisional Government had decided to continue with. He organised a plan with other dissidents to negotiate a passage for them through Germany, with whom Russia was then at war. Recognising that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens to travel in a train carriage through their territory, among them Lenin and his wife. The group then traveled by train from Zurich to Gottmadingen, and then to Sassnitz, followed by a ferry to Trelleborg in Sweden. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> train to Sweden, where they were welcomed by the mayor, and then on to Harapanda. From there, they went by sleigh to Tornio in Russian-controlled Finland, and then by train to Helsinki, before taking the final train to Petrograd.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} summer came the Bodyline series, when England toured under Douglas Jardine and targeted the upper bodies of the Australian batsmen with short-pitched bowling, using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from the body. In one of the tour matches before the Tests, Fingleton scored a defiant 119*, carrying his bat for New South Wales against the bumper barrage of Harold Larwood and Gubby Allen, ensuring his selection for the First Test. Despite his unbending resistance, his state fell to an innings defeat. In a warm-up for the Tests, he scored 29 and 53 not out for an Australian XI against the tourists, while most of his teammates struggled. His earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as Australia were crushed by ten wickets in the First Test in Sydney. Fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times. He then made a defiant four-hour innings to top-score with 83 in the first innings of Australia's only win of the series in the Second Test in Melbourne, although he did run out his batting partner Leo O'Brien in the process. This helped the Australians to reach 228 and <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 59-run first innings lead before winning the match despite Fingleton making {{only one in the}} second innings. He appeared as well equipped as any Australian to combat England's strategy.|$|E

5|$|Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma {{was born}} at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. The unusual name Zita was given her after a popular Italian Saint {{who had lived in}} Tuscany in the 13th century. She was the third {{daughter}} and fifth child of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and his wife Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Zita's father had lost his throne {{as a result of the}} movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was still a child. He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies (six of whom were mentally disabled, and three of whom died young). Duke Robert became a widower in 1882, and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita's mother. The second marriage produced a further twelve children. Zita was the 17th child among Duke Robert's 24 children. Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore (a large property located between Pietrasanta and Viareggio) and his castle in Schwarzau in lower Austria. It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years. The family spent most of the year in Austria moving to Pianore in the Winter and returning in the Summer. To move between them, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{opened their}} {{season with a}} three-game series in Arlington, Texas against the Rangers. On opening day, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 6–0 lead (thanks {{in part to a}} grand slam by Jimmy Rollins, his 200th career home run), but Cliff Lee gave up seven runs in the next two innings. The Phillies tied the game in the fourth inning, and over the next several innings Marlon Byrd and Cody Asche homered. Texas scored two more runs, but the Phillies won 14–10. Despite the 14 opening-day runs, Ryne Sandberg changed the lineup for the Phillies' second game (against left-handed Martin Perez) by replacing three left-handed hitters with right-handed hitters (perhaps to maximize the Phillies' platoon advantage). A. J. Burnett started, pitching six innings and giving up one run. The game was scoreless until the sixth inning before the Rangers won, 3–2, on a walk-off single by Adrián Beltré {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Although Kyle Kendrick allowed one run in seven innings in the series' final game, Jonathan Papelbon gave up three runs in the ninth inning (including a walk-off walk to Shin-Soo Choo) to blow the save. The Phillies lost two of their first three games, despite strong starting pitching in the last two.|$|E
