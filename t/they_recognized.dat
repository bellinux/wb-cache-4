5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{decided to}} recover Anazarbus and other territories {{which had been}} lost to the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, {{traveling}} along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought assistance from the Danishmend Emir Gazi Gümüshtigin who made a surprise attack on Bohemond's army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond {{because they did not}} recognize him; had <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> him, they would have saved him so they could demand a ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond's head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid Caliph.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Weksler {{and colleagues}} {{followed}} the 2001 definition by Sánchez {{and others for}} the restricted genus Oryzomys, but added O.antillarum from Jamaica as a species. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed Oryzomys from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of Oryzomys. <b>They</b> <b>recognized</b> eight species: the six previously mentioned plus O.albiventer and O.peninsulae. Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the subfossil Oryzomys curasoae from Curaçao as an island population of O.gorgasi. The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 genes to assess relationships within Oryzomys. They recommended that the marsh rice rat be split into two species and that O.couesi be split into four species {{on the basis of}} the observed sequence divergence and other data.|$|E

5|$|In a 2009 {{revision}} of the Oryzomys of western Mexico, M.D. Carleton and J. Arroyo-Cabrales noted substantial differences in coloration and measurements between highland populations (albiventer) and lowland populations (mexicanus) in Jalisco. On {{the basis of these}} differences, <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> O.albiventer as a species separate from the lowland populations, which they classified under O.couesi. They confirmed that Eliot's molestus was based on a large example of O.abiventer, but left the status of the three forms Goldman had associated with albiventer—crinitus, aztecus, and regillus—open, noting that there was no convincing evidence that these represented the same species as O.albiventer. The identity and exact provenance of fulgens (supposed to be from the Valley of Mexico), and consequently its relationship to O. albiventer, remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2011, Harper was honoured by Alberta's Blood tribe.

Harper issued this apology in 2008. The chief of the tribe explained that he believes the apology officially started the healing and rebuilding of relations between the federal and native councils. Lester B. Pearson, John Diefenbaker, and Jean Chrétien are the only other prime ministers of Canada to have been awarded the same honorary title.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim, St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri, St. Andrew's Church at Bandra, and Gloria Church at Byculla. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The British were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land-attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military and led them {{to find a new}} approach to high-threat search and rescue. <b>They</b> <b>recognized</b> that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, it should not be attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Gardner and James Patton {{suggested}} in 1976 that Allen's O.rivularis {{may be the}} same species as O.bombycinus. They considered O.bolivaris as probably the same as O.nitidus and listed castaneus as a synonym of O.capito (equivalent to modern Hylaeamys megacephalus and closely related species plus Transandinomys talamancae). In 1984, Benshoof and colleagues reported the first record of Oryzomys bombycinus from Honduras. Guy Musser and Marina Williams reviewed O.talamancae in 1985 and included O.castaneus {{as one of its}} synonyms, though without having examined the holotype. In the 1993 second edition of Mammal Species of the World, Musser and Michael Carleton used the name Oryzomys bolivaris for the species previously known as O.bombycinus, and in 1998, Musser and colleagues fully documented the allocation of the names bolivaris, castaneus, rivularis, bombycinus, alleni, and orinus to the same species, Oryzomys bolivaris. They noted its similarity to O.talamancae, but did not attempt to determine phylogenetic relationships among the species they discussed. In their limited material, they found geographic variation within the species inconsequential and <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> no subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Black Swan {{swept the}} Austin Film Critics Association and Independent Spirit Awards, winning five and four awards respectively. The film also won three awards {{at both the}} New York Film Critics Awards and the Oklahoma Film Critics Awards, and {{received}} a record 12 Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations. At the latter, the film was nominated in vastly different categories, ranging from its production design, to costumes and makeup to music featured in it. Black Swan performed similarly at the 64th British Academy Film Awards, again with 12 nominations, and was also nominated in similar categories. Another organization to laud the film with {{the same amount of}} nominations was the Alliance of Women Film Journalists. <b>They</b> <b>recognized</b> Black Swan in categories including Most Beautiful Film and its depiction of sexuality, but despite Arnonofsky's feature winning Best Film, it was also nominated in their Movie You Wanted To Love But Just Couldn‘t category.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. <b>They</b> <b>recognized</b> shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

5|$|Hananu {{and some}} of his aides {{traveled}} to Mar'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September, he signed a deal with them in which <b>they</b> <b>recognized</b> him as the representative of the Arab government of Syria and promised military aid. In the course of that month, Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support, and military advisers, from the remnants of the Ottoman Second Army. Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey, who were leading their respective revolts, both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy. In addition, the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria's inhabitants, and in northern Syria in particular, there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks. In the second week of September, Saleh al-Ali announced that he was ready to coordinate with Hananu's rebels.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{decryption}} of German radio communications, the Allied headquarters {{became aware}} of the German withdrawal plan. <b>They</b> <b>recognized</b> the open German flank to the east of the Rhône at Grenoble due the retreat of the 157th Infantry Division towards the Alps. To seize this opportunity, Taskforce Butler was ordered to advance in this direction, paralleling the German evacuation effort and ultimately cutting them off further north. While doing so, it fought some scattered German resistance, and finally, after turning left, found itself near Montélimar, a small city on the east bank of the Rhône River. This town lay directly on the German escape route. Following Taskforce Butler was the 36th Infantry Division. Together, they were tasked on 20August to block the German force at Montélimar as well as continue the northward advance to Grenoble, while VICorps was pursuing the Germans from behind. However, after this speedy advance, the forward Allied forces suffered now from a serious lack of fuel and supplies, which made this task difficult.|$|E
