5|$|In August 2017, NYC Ferry filed {{plans to}} build four ferry docks: one in Soundview, one in Yorkville, one near Stuyvesant Cove, {{and one on the}} Lower East Side. It also sought to add two more piers to its home port at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Soundview route was revised so that it would stop at East 34th Street instead of at East 62nd Street, which would no longer be built. That month, Brooklyn {{politicians}} called for docks to be built in Coney Island and Canarsie, owing to the new system's popularity. The Astoria route was projected to carry 1,800 daily passengers upon opening, by which point the service had seen 1.4 million riders. Due <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> ridership demand, three extra ferries were ordered in September 2017, by which time over 2 million people had ridden the ferry.|$|E

25|$|The river {{shoreline}} {{became the}} hub of early development. Produce from the farms inland was brought there to be shipped to New York City via what is now Main Street, which connected to the Albany Post Road, now US 9. To open the port <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> farmers, the Croton Turnpike (now NY 133) was built early in the 19th century.|$|E

Stalin eventually recognised his lack of know-how and relied on his professional generals to conduct the war.|$|E

The actual result may not be known until the votes are cast at the Democratic National Convention.|$|E
25|$|The term refugee {{is often}} used in {{different}} contexts: in everyday usage it refers to a forcibly displaced person who has fled their country of origin; in a more specific context it refers to such a person who was, on top of that, granted refugee status in the country the person fled <b>to.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> exclusive is the Convention refugee status which is given only to persons who fall within the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.|$|E

Research aimed at 1370°C (2500°F) turbine inlet temperature has led <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> efficient combined cycles and nearly 60% LHV efficiency (54% HHV efficiency) has been reached in the combined cycle unit of Baglan Bay, a GE H-technology gas turbine with a NEM 3 pressure reheat boiler, utilising steam from the HRSG to cool the turbine blades.|$|E
25|$|Thrash metal is {{directly}} responsible {{for the development of}} underground metal genres, such as death metal and black metal. In addition to this, metalcore, grindcore and deathcore employ similar riffs in their composition, the former with more focus on melody rather than chromaticism. The blending of punk ethos and metal's brutal nature led <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> extreme, underground styles after thrash metal began gaining mild commercial success in the late 1980s. With gorier subject matter, heavier downtuning of guitars, more consistent use of blast beat drumming, and darker, atonal death growls, death metal was established in the mid-1980s.|$|E

25|$|All Polynesian {{cultures}} are strongly stratified, ranging from somewhat less <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> Tongan culture is no exception, and despite almost {{two centuries of}} western influence, it is, together with Samoa still the most stratified culture. In former times the king (tui) with the royal family was on top. Below him were the high chiefs (houeiki), the estate holders and warlords. Below them the lower chiefs (fototehina). Below them the working chiefs (matāpule), in fact attendants to the chiefs to which they belonged, providing services to them, like fishing, tax collection, kavamixing, undertaking and protocol keeping. Below them the ordinary people (tua). Below them, or maybe more or less on the same level, the slaves, prisoners of war (popula).|$|E
25|$|Despite this advantage, the Rivet Top {{experienced}} {{two problems}} which reduced its effectiveness. Its listeners {{did not have}} radar scopes to correlate intercepted conversations with specific flights of MiGs, and thus could not determine which U.S. aircraft might be under attack. Secondly, like QRC-248, Rivet Gym was a Signals intelligence (SIGINT) asset of the National Security Agency, and subject <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> stringent rules protecting knowledge of its existence. Even when real-time warnings to U.S. aircraft were finally permitted in mid-1972, fighter crews were not {{made aware of the}} source of the warnings and because EC-121 radio communications were poor, mandating the use of a radio relay aircraft that often failed, they tended to disregard the credibility of the source.|$|E
25|$|Never Better {{is about}} Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life {{never seems to}} get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied with his own flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts {{to be a good}} husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right thing}} tend to lead <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.|$|E

25|$|In 706, in {{association}} with Wu Sansi, Zheng accused the coup leaders, by then all out of the capital Chang'an, of having conspired with Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (王同皎), who was executed early in 706 for having planned to kill Wu Sansi and depose Empress Wei. The five coup leaders were demoted to be military advisors to prefects in distant prefecture. Wu Sansi then had accusations about his affair with Empress Wei publicly posted in Luoyang, hoping to incense Emperor Zhongzong and then blame the coup leaders. Zheng then accused the coup leaders of having posted the accusations and requested that their clans be slaughtered. Emperor Zhongzong denied the request, but exiled the coup leaders <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> distant prefectures, where they subsequently died or were killed on Wu Sansi's orders.|$|E
25|$|The Day of the Dead {{season is}} the busiest for the Linares Family, with {{interest}} in the holiday in the United States and Europe translating <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> business for the enterprise. Their animated skeletons {{are known for their}} variety with those that dance, ride skateboards and do any number of common occupations past and present such as streetcar driver. They produce multicolored cardboard and paper skulls in various sizes although the most common is about 75cm tall. These skulls have various themes such as Don Quixote, street vendors of various types, bullfighters and figures from popular culture. They also make a version to imitate the sugar skulls created for Day of the Dead, which are profusely decorated with flowers, birds and other items. Their work has stood out for its ability to reinvent classic themes of Mexican cartonería.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, as Chairman of EDB, {{he decided}} to name {{publicly}} the holders of government scholarships who broke their bonds to shame them. This created a controversy generating public debates on whether those who received scholarship have {{a moral obligation to}} serve, or whether the scholarship is merely a contractual agreement which could be broken in return for the stated penalties. The debate culminated when MP Chng Hee Kok (庄熙国) questioned Yeo's decision. Yeo responded by calling for Chng to resign his seat in Parliament because of his view. This led <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> unhappiness at the audacity of a civil servant talking down to an elected Member of Parliament. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had to intervene in what was seen as a face-saving rebuke for both– that Philip Yeo was wrong to tell Chng Hee Kok to resign, but Chng had also been wrong in arguing that it was acceptable for scholars to break their bonds because they were merely legal contracts.|$|E
