5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E
5|$|During Simeon's rule, Bulgaria {{spread over}} a {{territory}} between the Aegean, the Adriatic and the Black Sea, and the new Bulgarian capital Preslav was said to rival Constantinople. <b>The</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Bulgarian Orthodox Church became the first new patriarchate besides the Pentarchy, and Bulgarian Glagolitic and Cyrillic translations of Christian texts spread all over the Slavic world of the time. It was at the Preslav Literary School in the 890s that the Cyrillic alphabet was developed. Halfway through his reign, Simeon assumed the title of Emperor (Tsar), having prior to that been styled Prince (Knyaz).|$|E
5|$|During World War I the Bialystok-Grodno District was the {{administrative}} division of German-controlled territory of Ober-Ost. It comprised the city, as the capital, {{and the surrounding}} Podlaskie region, roughly corresponding to {{the territory of the}} earlier Belostok Oblast. At the end of World War I the city became part of <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Second Polish Republic, as the capital of the Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939). During the 1919–1920 Polish-Soviet War, possession of the city by the Red Army and the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee occurred during the lead up to the Battle of Warsaw. During the resultant counteroffensive, the city returned to Polish control after the Battle of Białystok.|$|E

5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances {{could continue}} after Indian independence. The British took {{the view that}} {{because they had been}} established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> dominions of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E

While looking for investors, Steve Jobs was interested, but Lucas found his offer too low. Yet he {{accepted}} {{it in the}} end after {{it turned out to}} be impossible to find other investors. Jobs, who had recently been fired from Apple Computer, paid $5million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5million cash as capital into the company, and joined the board of directors as chairman.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} town was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During World War I the region was {{captured}} by the German Empire, which intended to incorporate the area into its province of East Prussia. After the German defeat, the victorious Entente was willing to assign the territory to either <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Poland or Lithuania. The future of the region was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919. The Germans, whose former Ober-Ost administration was preparing to evacuate, initially supported leaving the area to a Polish administration. However, as Poland was becoming an ally of France, German support gradually shifted towards Lithuania. In July 1919, when the German troops began their slow retreat from the area, they delegated the administration to local Lithuanian authorities. Lithuanian officers and troops, who first arrived in the region in May, began to organize military units in the pre-war Sejny county.|$|E

5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E
5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were {{absentee}} landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions. They were {{often seen as}} the exploiter of the tiller. This situation started to change when <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation {{in accordance with the}} constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula Kayada in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like inams and jagirs. This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.|$|E
5|$|Many Greek Orthodox populations, {{particularly}} those outside <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> modern Greek state, continued {{to refer to}} themselves as Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, born {{on the island of}} Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What are you looking at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier retorted. ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E

5|$|Nansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania (renamed Oslo in 1925), {{and later}} {{worked as a}} curator at the University Museum of Bergen where his {{research}} on {{the central nervous system}} of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of neurology. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; {{in the course of his}} research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Carl of Denmark to accept the throne of <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Entumbane uprising, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bulawayo or Entumbane II, {{occurred}} between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around Bulawayo, Zimbabwe amid political tensions in <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> state. Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating a situation that threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, barely a year {{after the end of the}} Bush War. The Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former Rhodesian Security Forces, fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new Zimbabwe National Army, put down the uprising. Groups of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller outbreak of fighting between guerrillas in November 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis caused <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> African {{states to}} reconsider their allegiances and {{internal}} ties. In particular, {{it led to}} the division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E
