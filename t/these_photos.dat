The Seafires strafed a radar station and an airfield on Moen island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire {{equipped with a}} reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; <b>these</b> <b>photos</b> were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments. One of the Seafires was shot down while attacking the airfield, resulting {{in the death of}} its pilot. This was the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{presented}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers showed off a demonstration of the game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. <b>These</b> <b>photos</b> would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} with Pollock, Hans Namuth had created two films and {{captured}} more than 500 photographs of the artist. [...] <b>These</b> <b>photos</b> were first published in 1951 in Portfolio, a journal edited by Alexey Brodovitch and Franz Zachary. [...] After the death of Pollock in 1956, Namuth's photos grew in popularity and were often used in articles about the painter in place of Pollock's artwork itself. [...] Art historian Barbara Rose states that the photographs changed art {{by focusing on the}} creation of art rather than the final product alone. [...] Younger artists such as Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra, and Robert Morris were able not only to view Pollock's paintings, but, with Namuth's images, to see Pollock in the act of painting, giving rise to the popularity of Process Art. [...] <b>These</b> <b>photos</b> have also allowed art historians to dissect the details of Pollock's method. For example, art historian Pepe Karmel found that Pollock's painting in Namuth's first black-and-white film began with several careful drippings forming two humanoid figures and a wolf before being covered beneath several layers of paint.|$|E
500|$|According to Kimmelman, {{the reason}} for their {{reluctance}} to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the worst fears {{of many of the}} interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced retailed for US$1,000.

500|$|Europa {{displayed}} {{a large number}} of intersecting linear features in the low-resolution photos from Voyager1. At first, scientists believed the features might be deep cracks, caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes. The high-resolution photos from Voyager2, taken closer to Jupiter, left scientists puzzled as the features in <b>these</b> <b>photos</b> were almost entirely lacking in topographic relief. This led many to suggest that these cracks might be similar to ice floes on Earth, and that Europa might have a liquid water interior. Europa may be internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one-tenth that ofIo, and as a result, the moon is thought to have a thin crust less than [...] thick of water ice, possibly floating on a 50-kilometers-deep (30mile) ocean.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Photosynthesis is {{the process}} by which plants, algae and photo {{synthetic}} bacteria convert sunlight energy into chemical energy (ATP). The initial stages of this process (harvesting solar energy and transferring it to the reaction centres) occur extremely fast and with an efficiency of close to 100 %. Studying the dynamics of these reactions will enable us to develop artificial functional light harvesting arrays and energy transfer systems that mimic the process in nature, thus helping us use light as an energy source that is environmentally clean, efficient, sustainable and carbon-neutral. These reactions can be measured using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy (transient absorption in the liquid phase and monitoring the subsequent kinetics in the wavelength region: 400 nm- 700 nm). In order to perform <b>these</b> experiments, <b>photo</b> synthetic pigment-protein complexes must be isolated, purified and characterised. In this work, <b>these</b> <b>photo</b> synthetic complexes were isolated from spinach leaves and characterised using various biological and spectroscopic techniques. Finally, the first results of pump-probe application to biological samples in South Africa were discussed. Master...|$|R
5000|$|Sullivan saw Come Play With Me as {{a chance}} to turn his then-girlfriend and {{magazine}} cover girl Mary Millington into a film star, as well as an opportunity for some cross-media marketing. Sullivan's magazines like Playbirds and Whitehouse are seen/referenced throughout the film, but it was with promoting the film through his magazines that Sullivan really came into his own. Months before the film's release Sullivan‚Äôs readers were promised Come Play with Me would be [...] "the British Deep Throat" [...] and would [...] "make Linda Lovelace look like Noddy". To add credibility to <b>these</b> claims, <b>photo</b> shoots that were only a few shades away from hardcore were published in Sullivan‚Äôs magazines and claimed to be stills from the upcoming film, whereas in fact they bore little resemblance to anything in Come Play With Me. A fixture in <b>these</b> <b>photo</b> shoots was hardcore actor Timothy Blackstone, sometimes billed in the articles as [...] "Randy Buck, Esquire".
