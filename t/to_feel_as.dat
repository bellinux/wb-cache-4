5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and {{the ruins of the}} Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E

25|$|An {{automobile}} simulator {{provides an}} opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they {{are sitting in the}} cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though {{are out of control}} which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are fives {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with panic disorder.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (<b>to</b> <b>feel)</b> <b>as</b> opposed to voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way as}} underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E

The first details of the game were revealed at the [...] "Star Ocean Special Stage" [...] during the Square Enix Party 2007, alongside those of [...] Yoshinori Yamagishi, producer of the series, stated that he wants the remakes <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though they're completely new games.|$|E
500|$|The player {{character}} in Myst, Riven, Exile and Revelation is the [...] "stranger"; the character's {{real name is}} never given and remains faceless at all times. Atrus addresses the player character as [...] "my friend" [...] in cutscenes. Cyan's intent was for players <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though they were themselves there, stranded on a mysterious island with {{no choice but to}} explore. Thus, the games' protagonist is an anonymous, gender-neutral entity with no given history, and players are free to imagine themselves as the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} project ready for theaters, Lasseter {{would need to}} add 12 minutes or so of {{material}} and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since {{it could not be}} mere padding—it would have <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if it had always been there, an organic part of the film. With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. [...] There, he hosted what he called a [...] "story summit", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.|$|E

500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim {{told me that the}} Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all they do is work, work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So {{when it comes time to}} dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode {{is based on the}} Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the body}} of the Autobiography, Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is {{seemingly}} absent: [...] "Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium". Wideman argues that Haley wrote {{the body of}} the Autobiography in a manner of MalcolmX's choosing and the epilogue {{as an extension of the}} biography itself, his subject having given him carte blanche for the chapter. Haley's voice in {{the body of the}} book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by MalcolmX but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though the voice of MalcolmX is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: [...] "Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told." ...|$|E

500|$|There are {{multiple}} features {{omitted from the}} game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though they are lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. [...] "You're not building yourself into a tank," [...] said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic {{in a way that}} forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the [...] "anti-video game play mechanic". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, {{in order for them to}} [...] "feel every strike". The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices, in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters.|$|E
500|$|Sony {{requested}} that MediEvil should support the PlayStation analogue controller, which Sorrell {{described as a}} [...] "particularly fortuitous event" [...] as it allowed them to capture much more fluidity and intuitiveness within the game. New concepts such as camera and character control presented many drawbacks and required the team to try {{out a number of}} approaches before settling on solutions that seemed to work. The team finally settled on the concept that MediEvil would support both analogue and digital camera-related controls for balance reasons. Sorrell stated that a spline camera view was the first attempt, but he disliked it {{due to the lack of}} freedom for the player <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if he was exploring. It was then changed to a free-form camera view, which [...] "just worked". There were also many levels and ideas from the original concept that the team were forced to remove due to time or budget constraints. There was intended to be a platform-oriented section of the game where the player would control the worm that lived in Daniel's skull. Concept art and a separate level was created for this section, but it never materialised into the game.|$|E
500|$|... "Elogium" [...] inaugurated Biller's term as {{a writer}} for Star Trek: Voyager. [...] When he brought in the script for series co-creators Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor to review, {{he was told that}} {{it was a very good}} script. [...] However, Piller said that [...] "I don't think the teaser works at all." [...] Biller {{received}} so many notes on the script that he began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though the experience were an audition. [...] After rewriting the script, Taylor expressed his pleasure with Biller's technical descriptions within the script and asked if Biller had a science background; ironically, Biller had instead attended Brown University specifically to avoid taking science courses—the technical details were all made up. The day after presenting the rewrite, Taylor asked Biller to join the Voyager writing staff. [...] Biller had been unaware of the vacancy, having come on board for the $15,000 fee and expecting nothing more. [...] Though initially reluctant, Biller took Taylor's offer for the [...] "opportunity to write television that was about something." [...] Taylor and Biller conceded that it was UPN's holding back of the episode until the second season that resulted in Ensign Wildman's strange gestation period of seven or eight months.|$|E
50|$|Margaret Mahler {{also saw}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sadness <b>as</b> an {{emotional}} achievement, as opposed for example to warding it off through restless hyperactivity. D. W.

60|$|Mr. Prendergast {{was afraid}} {{to bring out the}} very pith of his story in so abrupt a manner. He wished to have the work over, <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> that <b>as</b> {{regarded}} Herbert it was done,--but his heart failed him when he came to it.|$|R

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it [...] "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do." ...|$|E
500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
