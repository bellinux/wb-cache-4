Some favored the latter design {{because it would have}} greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the pathway.|$|E

This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Empire.
