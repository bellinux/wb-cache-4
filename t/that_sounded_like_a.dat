Three months later, Yokota presented three different styles of music to Miyamoto: one piece had an orchestral sound, the other had pop music, and the last featured a mix of both orchestral and pop music. Miyamoto chose the orchestral piece, as it sounded the most [...] "space-like". Yotaka stated that Miyamoto chose the piece without knowing that Kondo actually wrote it. In a retrospective interview, Satoru Iwata said that Miyamoto chose the music that sounded [...] "space-like" [...] because he was looking for a sound that would express the game, in contrast to the tropical sounds of Super Mario Bros. Yotaka revealed that he initially struggled to create music <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Super Mario game, but as time progressed he declared that the songs he made for the game had [...] "become natural".|$|E
500|$|After {{a day or}} so, Adams' family {{began searching}} the city for him, placing notices in several {{newspapers}} such as the New York Courier and Enquirer and the New York Weekly Tribune notifying people he was missing. A neighbor of Colt's, Asa H. Wheeler, told Adams' father-in-law, Joseph Lane, {{that he had heard}} noises in Colt's office <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fight followed by a crash to the floor. Peering in the keyhole, he saw someone [...] "bending over something on the floor". [...] Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and saw that a large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed. On September 22, 1841, Colt visited Adams' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams. Adams' bookbinder, Charles Wells, told Colt that the last time Adams had been seen was on the way to visit Colt himself. Colt made no reply to the implied allegation, and excused himself.|$|E

For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: [...] "In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take." [...] In {{his review of}} Corea's later work The Ultimate Adventure, Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes: [...] "'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cheesy video-game soundtrack."

[...] John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian, writing that the album [...] "cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'", and that it [...] "drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory".|$|E
500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E

Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing we had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. <b>That</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E

[...] The first radio transmitters, called spark gap transmitters, transmitted information by wireless telegraphy, using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in Morse code. [...] They couldn't transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of damped waves, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> buzz in receivers.

2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Music critic Kim Young-dae of Idology {{noted that}} the album {{exhibited}} [...] "diverse genres and approaches, fitting well into the current scene as a result". He observed that the band avoided a cliché chorus and opted for [...] "trendy brass grooves and a fluent melody" [...] in [...] "Hide and Seek", and dubbed the experimentation in the composition and arrangement of [...] "Domino" [...] as [...] "refreshing". Also writing for Idology as 'Mimyo', musician Moon Yong-min noticed that the album [...] "sets its foot between [...] uneasy cleavages" [...] of rock, K-pop, and dance music [...] "from {{the texture of the}} approach". He sensed that the mixture of sounds came across as [...] "nonchalant" [...] as opposed to engaging in them for the purpose of [...] "popular appeal or an 'edgy', hybrid element". He recalled past attempts of rock band popular music, but noted that CNBLUE worked well in avoiding the [...] "discomfort" [...] of trying to sell records. In a mixed review, Cao Jiefeng of Malaysian newspaper Sin Chew Daily claimed that the band lacks the ability to create a [...] "hit hook" [...] and that it should strive to develop more [...] "outstanding" [...] melodies. He pointed out that the element of rock music almost disappeared in some tracks, saying that [...] "Drunken Night" [...] was essentially a techno dance-pop song <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 2PM or B1A4 [...] "side-cut". He spotlighted [...] "Domino" [...] {{as one of the top}} tracks, stating that the [...] "cool rockers" [...] become [...] "the romantic bourgeoisie" [...] in the song. He also applauded [...] "Radio"; he compared it to a British band Coldplay's and Swedish producer Avicii's [...] "A Sky Full of Stars", revering its [...] "grand chorus" [...] and [...] "wild guitar solo". He concluded that 2gether is a [...] "revolutionary production" [...] that paved the way to a [...] "promising start" [...] in CNBLUE distinguishing itself from Maroon 5.|$|E
2500|$|The Strokes {{frontman}} Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi {{started writing}} {{material for the}} album in January 2009, intent on entering the studio that February. Julian commented in Rolling Stone that they had completed about three songs <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mixture of 1970s rock and [...] "music from the future". On March 31, 2009 from their MySpace account, the band announced {{the end of their}} [...] "much needed hibernation period" [...] and the commencement of new writing and rehearsing for a fourth full-length album, entitled Angles. This album would be different from the first three in that it would feature music written by the other four Strokes, rather than Casablancas writing ninety-five percent of the material again: [...] "It's supercollaborative, and it sounds different," [...] said Valensi, [...] "but it has a Strokes vibe to it." [...] In an NME article, Pharrell Williams expressed interest in producing this upcoming album. This followed the news that Casablancas had collaborated with Williams and Santigold on [...] "My Drive Thru", a track commemorating the 100th anniversary of Converse's Chuck Taylor All-Stars shoe. The song was available as a free download from the official Converse site. The album was due to be released in late 2009, but disagreements about the songs' readiness forced the Strokes to scale back this date. On February 1, 2010, the Strokes announced on their website that the recording of the fourth album was being helmed by award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli. According to Chiccarelli in an interview with HitQuarters, the two camps first met in 2009 and, after finding they shared a similar mind space and similar thoughts on the potential direction of the new record, tried out some tracking. [...] Not long after recording began, however, the band became frustrated with Chiccarelli's reserved production style. [...] Only one song from these recording sessions, [...] "Life Is Simple in the Moonlight", remained on the album's track listing. [...] Inspired, in part, by bands like MGMT, Arctic Monkeys, and Crystal Castles, the Strokes decided to experiment with various production techniques, and recorded the rest of the album's material at Albert Hammond, Jr.'s home studio in upstate New York with award-winning engineer Gus Oberg.|$|E
