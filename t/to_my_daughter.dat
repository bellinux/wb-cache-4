500|$|In {{his review}} of Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter,</b> Younge states, [...] "At moments in the book she sounds like an elderly relative, distraught at the wayward manners of the young," [...] but also says that Angelou seems to have [...] "outlived the need for social convention". Kirkus Reviews finds [...] "old {{fashioned}} wisdom" [...] in the book, and calls it [...] "a slim volume packed with nourishing nuggets of wisdom". Reviewer Karen Algeo Krizman says that [...] "Angelou delivers with her signature passion and fire" [...] and that although the essays are [...] "easy to take in during brief moments of quiet", they have a powerful message. Laura L. Hutchison of The Fredicksburg Free Lance-Star states that Letter is [...] "written in Angelou's beautiful, poetic style" [...] and called the essays [...] "advice from a beloved aunt or grandmother, whose wisdom you know was earned". Hutchinson also stated that the book would gain Angelou new readers, and that her current audience would read and reread it. Psychologists Eranda Jayawickreme and Marie J. C. Forgearda called the essays in Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter</b> [...] "illuminating" [...] and {{used it as a}} non-scientific, interdisciplinary textto teach positive psychology.|$|E
500|$|Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter</b> (2009) is {{the third}} book of essays by African-American writer and poet Maya Angelou. [...] By {{the time it was}} published, Angelou had written two other books of essays, several volumes of poetry, and six autobiographies. [...] She was {{recognized}} and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women, and had become [...] "a major autobiographical voice of the time". [...] Angelou had no daughters herself, but was inspired to write Letter as she was going through 20 years of notes and essay ideas, some of which were written for her friend Oprah Winfrey. [...] Angelou wrote the book for the thousands of women who saw her as a mother figure, and to share the wisdom gained throughout her long life.|$|E

500|$|Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter</b> is Maya Angelou's third book of essays. [...] She had {{published}} several volumes of poetry, including Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which {{was nominated for}} the Pulitzer Prize. She had recited her poem, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning", at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. In 2009, when Letter was published, Angelou {{had published}} six out of her seven installments of her series of autobiographies. Her sixth autobiography, A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), was considered her final autobiography until she published her seventh autobiography, Mom & Me & Mom, in 2013, {{at the age of}} 85.|$|E
500|$|Critics have judged Mom & Me & Mom and Angelou's other autobiographies [...] "in {{light of}} the first", and Caged Bird {{generally}} receives the highest praise. [...] Marjorie Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor, considers the book a sequel to Caged Bird.' [...] Many of the events described in Angelou's previous autobiographies are revisited in this one, some with more detail than others, such as her period of homelessness, which was described in Caged Bird, and her serious beating by her jealous boyfriend, which was first disclosed in Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter</b> (2008), Angelou's third book of essays. [...] According to Fiona Sturges, who reviewed Mom & Me & Mom in the British publication The Independent, [...] "As in her previous books, these tales are told with clear-sightedness and an absence of self-pity, and they are no less grim for their familiarity. Angelou has never been one for florid prose, and here she maintains a precise and economical style which makes these bleak moments more vivid, like a film from which you can't look away". [...] Sayers states that major dramatic events, such as the incident when Angelou was beaten, [...] "are delivered without much amplification or further reference".|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Elsie B. Washington, {{most likely}} due to President Clinton's choice of Angelou to recite her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at his 1993 inauguration, called her [...] "the black woman's poet laureate". [...] Sales of the {{paperback}} version of her books and poetry rose by 300–600% the week after Angelou's recitation. Random House, which published the poem later that year, had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books {{to keep up with}} the demand. [...] They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1200% increase. [...] Angelou famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, [...] "I agree with Balzac and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, 'I write for money. [...] Younge, speaking after the publication of Angelou's third book of essays, Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter</b> (2008), has said, [...] "For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art—issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry, song and conversation".|$|E

500|$|Mom & Me & Mom (2013) is {{the seventh}} of Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies. [...] It was {{completed}} 11 {{years after the}} publication of her previous autobiography, A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and over thirty years after she wrote her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). [...] Mom & Me & Mom, in which Angelou relates her relationship with her mother Vivian Baxter, was published shortly before Mother's Day and Angelou's 85th birthday. [...] In the time period between the publication of her sixth and seventh autobiographies, Angelou was the first African-American woman and living poet selected by Sterling Publishing, who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their Poetry for Young People series in 2004. In 2009, Angelou wrote [...] "We Had Him", a poem about Michael Jackson, which was read by Queen Latifah at his funeral, [...] and wrote [...] "His Day is Done", a poem honoring Nelson Mandela after his death in 2013. [...] She published a book of essays, Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter,</b> in 2009, and two cookbooks, Hallelujah! The Welcome Table in 2004 and Great Food, All Day Long in 2010. [...] During this period, she was awarded the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Daughter,</b> {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the {{best thing that ever happened}} to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. I might even entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind... Not like those childish roughnecks in the square!
