Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved. Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese as matsuri (祭) which {{celebrate}} annually. There are no specific festival days {{for all of}} Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon. Festivals are often based around one event, with food stalls, entertainment, and carnival games <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> entertained. Its usually sponsored by a local shrine or temple, though they can be secular.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses {{to play with the}} other children. The snowman starts {{speaking}} to the boy, repeating his assertions that the other children are silly. Fifty years later, the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds. He uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> away from him. They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city.|$|E

5|$|Strong winds {{knocked out}} power and {{telephone}} lines across the eastern {{region of the}} country, leaving thousands isolated until the lines were repaired hours later. The cyclone caused extensive damage along the coastline, including {{in the city of}} Sur and the village of Ras al Hadd at the easternmost point of the Omani mainland. In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported to the oil fields of the nation. The liquefied natural gas terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing. Around 20,000people were affected, and damage in the country was estimated at around $4.2billion (2007USD).|$|E

25|$|Keynes' {{basic idea}} was simple: <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> fully employed, governments {{have to run}} deficits {{when the economy is}} slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep {{production}} at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes.|$|E

25|$|Much of the Western public still {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as a close {{ally in the}} context of the recent defeat of Nazi Germany and of Japan.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn, but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light will deliver a high amount of energy– enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a sunburn. A photon of infrared light will deliver a lower amount of energy– only enough to warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a sunburn.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{inception}} of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, {{there had been some}} techniques <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> alive developed in the 18th century, both in Japan and in Europe, however {{it was not until the}} mid-20th century that James Elam and Peter Safar discovered and published the method now known as CPR. Safar conducted research on existing basic life support procedures including controlling a person’s breathing airway by tilting back his or her head with an open mouth; and using mouth-to-mouth breathing. He combined these with a procedure known as closed-chest cardiac massage to become the basic life support method of CPR.|$|E

25|$|The center {{platform}} {{was first}} used in passenger service in 1959, but was originally built {{along with the other}} platforms. It served the purpose of a Spanish solution, allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would open the doors on both sides. Newer subway cars' door controls made it more difficult to open doors {{on both sides of the}} train simultaneously; thus this solution became impractical and the platform was closed on November 8, 1973. In 2007–2010, it was converted to a crossunder between the IRT side platforms. Large metal fences have been erected <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> away from the edges.|$|E

Altamirano, Jesús Terán, Ponciano Arriaga, Niños Héroes and 20 de Noviembre suffered severe damage such as severely cracked foundations. In {{the days after the}} quake, military and police cordoned off ten buildings <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> out, leading a number of them to sleep on the streets. Twelve buildings in the complex were so severely damaged that they were demolished in the next six months.|$|E
25|$|Three {{minutes after}} the blast, {{hundreds}} of angry residents gathered at the scene and confronted the undercover soldiers. The soldiers fired live rounds at the ground and into the air <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> back. The crowd kept drawing back and moving forward again until 9:50, when the RUC arrived and began firing plastic bullets at the protesters. Two women were wounded by plastic bullets and the undercover soldiers then fled in unmarked cars, setting off crackers or fireworks at the same time. Sinn Féin councillor Francie Molloy claimed that the protesters forced the SAS to withdraw, saving Doris's life in the process. Witnesses allegedly feared an undercover soldier brandishing a pistol would have killed the wounded Doris with a shot to his head.|$|E

25|$|United States' {{concept of}} a {{reservation}} had not {{been used by the}} Spanish, Mexicans or other Apache neighbors before. Reservations were often badly managed, and bands that had no kinship relationships were forced to live together. No fences existed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> in or out. It was not uncommon for a band to be given permission to leave {{for a short period of}} time. Other times a band would leave without permission, to raid, return to their homeland to forage, or to simply get away. The military usually had forts nearby. Their job was keeping the various bands on the reservations by finding and returning those who left. The reservation policies of the United States produced conflict and war with the various Apache bands who left the reservations for almost another quarter century.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} summer {{session at the}} University, both Moore and Sharpe began to work with players on the {{offensive}} change, and in August Royal and Bellard traveled to Tuscaloosa and led a coaching clinic for the Alabama staff on the wishbone. In {{order to keep the}} change a secret, Bryant closed all of the Crimson Tide's practices closed from the public, screened the practice field from view with a canvas and hired security <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> away. The change to the wishbone was kept under such secrecy that when the media would visit practice, Bryant had the team practice the pro-style system that was phased out. Alabama later opened the season with an upset victory over USC that was credited to the surprise switch to the wishbone that caught the Trojans off-guard.|$|E
25|$|Good Samaritan laws offer legal {{protection}} {{to people who}} give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, {{for fear of being}} sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance, and holds those who fail to do so liable.|$|E
