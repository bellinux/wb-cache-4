Argus is {{typically}} used in tandem with Hercules, where it hovers several meters above the seafloor and provides a view of Hercules on the seafloor, but {{can also be used}} as a standalone <b>tow</b> <b>sled.</b> The frame carries a broadcast quality high definition camera, standard definition cameras, and two 1,200 Watt arc lamps capable of producing over 100,000 lumens of light each. Argus also supports a wide range of instrumentation, including a depth sensor, altimeter, CTD, sub-bottom profiler, scanning sonar, and side-scan sonar. Argus uses dual two-horsepower electric thrusters for heading adjustment and limited lateral movement.|$|E
50|$|But, the {{technology}} also {{started to be}} used in other applications. In 1998, salvager Paul Tidwell and his company Cape Verde Explorations led an expedition to the wreck site of the World War 2 Japanese cargo submarine I-52 in the mid-Atlantic. Resting at a depth of 5240 meters, it had been located and then identified using side scan sonar and an underwater <b>tow</b> <b>sled</b> in 1995. War-time records indicated the I-52 was bound for Germany, with a cargo including 146 gold bars in 49 metal boxes. This time, Mr. Tidwell's company had hired the Russian oceanographic vessel, the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh with its two manned deep-ocean submersibles MIR-1 and MIR-2 (figure 3). In order to facilitate precise navigation across the debris field and assure a thorough search, MIR-1 deployed a long baseline transponder network on the first dive. Over a series of seven dives by each submersible, the debris field was progressively searched. The LBL positioning record indicated the broadening search coverage after each dive, allowing the team to concentrate on yet unsearched areas during the following dive. No gold was found, but the positioning system had documented the extent of the search.|$|E

5000|$|This {{attention}} {{is due in}} part to its magnificent, remote mountain setting. Its location within a protected area in a national park prohibits motorized ground access, and the risk of flooding in its entrance has limited most explorations to mid or late winter, so cavers must access it via a 20 km ski with <b>towed</b> <b>sleds,</b> or by helicopter. This feeling of remoteness is compounded by the cave's linear layout and its single entrance.

40|$|A key design {{challenge}} in at-sea refueling and recovery of Unmanned Sea surface Vehicles (USSVs) {{is making a}} connection with the USSV to the <b>towed</b> <b>sled,</b> in view of relative motions between the two. To enable a reliable connection, the USSV must be capable of positioning its bow within the sled’s docking aperture. The level of confidence is traded off against size and acceptable sea state operating range for recovery and refueling equipment. NSWC Carderock Division Detachment Norfolk performed at-sea experiments designed to acquire real world, statistically significant data to determine the ability of an autonomous USSV to hit a target {{under a variety of}} operational conditions including sea state, heading relative to the sea, and USSV speed. The resulting extensive set of motion and positional data will be useful for future system designers for years to come. This work was funded by the Office of Naval Research, Sea Platforms and Weapons Division. NSWC Carderock Division Detachment Norfolk has developed a system to enable underway refueling of USSVs in open ocean conditions that does not require recovering the USSV. This concept relies on a two-part connection, the initial latching of the USSV to a <b>towed</b> <b>sled,</b> and a fluid seal. The capture and fueling system consists of an extendable probe in the USSV's bow that engages a receiving mechanism mounted in the vertex of a V-shaped sled.

Twenty athletes performed 30 -m sprints in three different conditions: (a) un-resisted, (b) <b>sled</b> <b>towing,</b> and (c) vest sprinting. During <b>sled</b> <b>towing</b> and vest sprinting, external loads of 15 % and 20 % of body mass were used. Sprint times were recorded over 10 and 30 m. Sagittal-plane high-speed video data were recorded at 5, 15, and 25 m from the start. Relative to the un-resisted condition, sprint time increased (7. 5 to 19. 8 %) in both resisted conditions, resulting mainly from decreased step length (− 5. 2 to − 16. 5 %) with small decreases in step frequency (− 2. 7 to − 6. 1 %). Sled towing increased stance phase duration (14. 7 to 26. 0 %), trunk angle (12. 5 to 71. 5 %), and knee angle (10. 3 to 22. 7 %), and decreased swing phase duration (− 4. 8 to − 15. 2 %) relative to the un-resisted condition. Vest sprinting increased stance phase duration (12. 8 to 24. 5 %) and decreased swing phase duration (− 8. 4 to − 14. 4 %) and trunk angle (− 1. 7 to − 13. 0 %).

40|$|The use of {{weighted}} <b>sled</b> <b>towing</b> as {{a training}} tool to improve athlete acceleration has received considerable attention; however, its effectiveness for developing acceleration is equivocal. This study compared {{the effects of}} combined weighted <b>sled</b> <b>towing</b> and sprint training against traditional sprint training on 10 and 30 m speed in professional rugby union players (n = 20). After baseline testing of 10 and 30 m speed, participants were assigned to either the combined <b>sled</b> <b>towing</b> and sprint training (SLED) or traditional sprint training (TRAD) groups, matched for 10 -m sprint times. Each group completed 2 training sessions per week for 6 weeks, with performance reassessed post-training. Both training programmes improved participants' 10 and 30 m speed (p < 0. 001), but the performance changes (from pre to post) in 10 m (SLED - 0. 04 ± 0. 01 vs. TRAD - 0. 02 ± 0. 01 seconds; p < 0. 001) and 30 m (SLED - 0. 10 ± 0. 03 vs. TRAD - 0. 05 ± 0. 03 seconds; p = 0. 003) sprint times were significantly greater in the SLED training group. Similarly, the percent change within the SLED group for the 10 m (SLED - 2. 43 ± 0. 67 vs. TRAD - 1. 06 ± 0. 80 seconds; p = 0. 003) and 30 m (SLED - 2. 46 ± 0. 63 vs. TRAD - 1. 15 ± 0. 72 seconds; p = 0. 003) tests were greater than the TRAD group.
