2500|$|Darrieus wind turbine: [...] "Eggbeater" [...] turbines, or Darrieus turbines, {{were named}} after the French inventor, Georges Darrieus. They have good efficiency, but produce large torque ripple and {{cyclical}} stress on the tower, which contributes to poor reliability. They also generally require some external power source, or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning, because the starting torque is very low. The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor. Solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area. Newer Darrieus type turbines are not held up by guy-wires but have an external superstructure connected to the <b>top</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Deschanel's [...] "kooky" [...] style {{subsequently}} found {{a popular}} outlet as Los Angeles teacher Jess Day, whom she {{played in the}} Fox TV sitcom, New Girl (2011-). Jess's fashion preferences, including some striking brassières {{in a range of}} colours, attracted much interest, while, around the same time, Anastasia (Ana) Steel's tastes in E. L. James' best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey (2011) were thought to have assisted sales of exotic lingerie. Blue was a favoured color (Natalie Portman as Dr. Emma Kurtzman was shown dressing hastily for work in a lacy blue bra in the 2011 film, No Strings Attached) and was Ana's own preference: [...] "I'm in the pale blue lacy perfect-fit bra. Thank heavens". In 2010, the winning German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest proclaimed, [...] "I even did my hair for you/I bought new underwear, they're blue" [...] (Satellite, sung by Lena).

In the photo, a thirteen-year-old Harrison is pictured in {{the centre of the}} top row, his face tinted blue; school teachers appear dressed in long-sleeve <b>tops</b> <b>bearing</b> a superimposed record-company logo or Om symbol. Wilkes and Harrison disagreed over the size of the Babaji image, which the designer apparently disliked and wanted to reduce in size.|$|R
50|$|In service, {{the unit}} {{proved to be}} a {{somewhat}} mixed bag; some owners reported excellent reliability and long engine lives, others complained of overheating, frequent blowing of head gaskets, cylinder head cracks (cracks between the valve seats are common and do not represent danger if the cracks do not exceed specifications), premature wear of the bottom and <b>top</b> end <b>bearings,</b> low oil pressure etc.|$|R

On the lower end it carries the Archimedean screw which is partly submerged in water. The screw doesn't rotate in a pipe but has a fixed encasing which simplifies the design further. The top end of the shaft carries the Common sails with a span of approximately 5 to 6 meters. In some cases wooden slats are used instead of sail cloth. The mill can be stopped using a band brake on the brake disk which is fitted on the shaft behind the <b>top</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Exposed hub locks can {{be broken}} or damaged by {{off-road}} conditions, rendering 4×4 useless and leaving the vehicle stranded. Also, in some axle designs (such as those used on older Land Rovers), the <b>top</b> swivel <b>bearing</b> can become starved for lubrication (which is normally supplied by oil slung up by the rotating axle), unless the hubs are locked every few hundred miles. Also, since locking hubs generally do not require a key to operate, they can be maliciously locked or unlocked by persons other than the vehicle owner.|$|R

50|$|A {{refurbishment}} in {{the late}} 1970s/early 1980s started converting the six-seat compartment stock to 3+2-seat open saloons. At the same time, the red-brown horsehair seating and metal-framed cord overhead luggage racks were replaced with standard Mark 2 seats and metal racks. 2 x 25w. ceiling bulbs lit each compartment, and the partitions were initially painted in light cream: three publicity panels about 15 cm x 40 cm filled the space on the compartment walls between {{the top of the}} seats and the luggage racks - the central panel was originally a mirror, but as these proved dangerous in service they were soon replaced with normal advertising. The other fittings were a chain alarm-cord in a recess above and {{to one side of the}} door, and the door-lock itself, a simple spring-loaded slide: the slam-doors could be opened at speed, albeit at considerable risk to the passenger doing so. The door window could also be opened full-length into a recess in the door panel beneath, initially supported at the bottom by a leather strop, which was soon replaced by a metal friction-bar at the <b>top,</b> <b>bearing</b> on the side-rails - in general they were either closed or with a one- or two-inch opening. The flooring was a strong linoleum on wooded baulks: the linoleum was not present in the guards compartments, which together with the cabs were painted in a dark green. A mirror to a roof periscope facing along the length of the unit was fitted centrally to the guard's side of the rear compartment partition, together with a handle for the sweep=arm cleaner of the roof glasa. Underneath was a small worksurface about 2'x1', a swivel-chair screwed to the floor, and variously a short ladder for evacuating coaches, sometimes a medical cabinet, and a rail-shorting bar would be fixed to the side of the compartment. The driver's cab was fitted with one flap-down seat on each side: the driver occupied the left-hand position.|$|E

40|$|DNA topoisomerase II (Top 2) is an {{essential}} nuclear enzyme and a target of very effective anticancer drugs including anthracycline antibiotics. Even though several aspects of drug activity against Top 2 are understood, the drug receptor site is not yet known. Several Top 2 mutants have altered drug sensitivity and have provided information of structural features determining drug action. Here, we have investigated the sensitivity to three closely related anthracycline derivatives of yeast <b>Top</b> 2 <b>bearing</b> mutations in the CAP-like domain and integrated the findings with computer models of ternary drug-enzyme-DNA complexes. The results suggest {{a model for the}} anthracycline receptor wherein a drug molecule has specific interactions with the cleaved DNA as well as amino acid residues of the CAP-like domain of an enzyme monomer. The drug molecule is intercalated into DNA at the site of cleavage, and interestingly, drug-enzyme contacts involve one side of the four-ring chromophore and the side chain of the anthracycline molecule. The findings may explain several established structure-activity relationships of antitumor anthracyclines and may thus provide a framework for further developments of effective Top 2 poisons...|$|R
