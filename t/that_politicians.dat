5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{conveying}} {{a message}} through a periodically updated clock found an earlier {{expression in the}} Doomsday Clock.

In particular, {{it has become a}} national fixture shows that the U.S.'s increasing debt. By 1995, the New York Times reported <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> were citing the clock to advocate for a reduction to the national budget.

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had {{a master plan}} to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the {{remaining}} independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand {{the power of the}} Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–14. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, {{after two}} years in the largely rural diocese of Hereford, Henson {{returned}} to Durham as its bishop. The industrial north-east of England, including County Durham, was badly affected by an economic depression. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and socialism, and for a time his forthright expression of his views made him unpopular in the diocese. His opinions about some Church matters changed radically during his career: at first a strong advocate of the Church of England's continued establishment as the country's official church, he came to believe <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> could not be trusted to legislate properly on ecclesiastical matters, and he espoused the cause of disestablishment. He campaigned against efforts to introduce prohibition, exploitation of foreign workers by British companies, and fascist and Nazi aggression, and supported reform of the divorce laws, a controversial revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

25|$|Several {{economists and}} {{political}} scientists {{have argued that}} economic inequality translates into political inequality, particularly in situations where politicians have financial incentives to respond to special interest groups and lobbyists.

25|$|UMNO {{critics contend}} that the {{official}} figure {{does not take into}} account the huge volume of shares, amounting to 7.9 percent in 1999, that is held by nominee companies. Independent studies have revealed <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> and political parties, including UMNO, have resorted to using nominee companies to conceal their ownership of corporate equity from public scrutiny. Also, branded conglomerates like Proton and Petronas are not regarded by the government as Bumiputra companies. This approach tends to exaggerate non-Malay purchasing power. It is also not clear if the government calculations included the 2.7 million unincorporated businesses in the country.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{association}} between politician ownership and accounting conservatism for a sample of S&P 1500 firms between 2005 and 2011. The contracting explanation predicts <b>that</b> <b>politician</b> owned firms adopt less conservative accounting because lenders are less concerned with downside default risk for these politically favored firms. The political costs explanation predicts <b>that</b> <b>politician</b> owned firms adopt more conservative financial reporting to shield allied politicians from voter scrutiny. I find that equity ownership {{by members of the}} U. S. House and Senate is associated with lower levels of conditional conservatism. This negative association is more pronounced among: (1) firms owned by local politicians, where there is a greater alignment between the interests of the politician and the firm, and (2) firms with long-term issuer credit ratings, for which debt market participants particularly value conservatism as a mechanism for conveying information on downside default risk. I also examine the relationship between politician ownership and unconditional conservatism and fail to document a statistical relationship between the two constructs. Collectively, the results of my thesis provide consistent evidence of a lower contracting demand for conditional conservatism among politician owned firms...|$|R
25|$|Research also {{indicated}} that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–06, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population. Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and {{were also more likely}} than average to think <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> were personally corrupt. There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the Daily Mail, Daily Express, and The Sun, all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of papers in the {{economics}} literature suggest that carbon taxes should be preferred to carbon trading (Carbon Trust, 2009). Counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference <b>that</b> <b>politicians</b> may have for emissions trading compared with taxes (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). One of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries, rather than the revenues going to the government. In comparison, industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax. It is therefore argued that with emissions trading, polluters {{have an incentive to}} cut emissions, but if they are exempted from a carbon tax, they have no incentive to cut emissions (Smith, 2008, pp.56–57). On the other hand, freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour (World Bank, 2010, p.268).|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his term as leader of the Moderate Youth League, Reinfeldt supported the government of Prime Minister Bildt, but he gradually changed his views and became more critical of the party leadership. In 1993 he wrote the book [...] "Det sovande folket" [...] (The Sleeping Nation), in which he criticized the Swedish welfare state and argued for the introduction of a neoliberalist society. The book argues that the welfare state is a stillborn construction, as it systematically puts people in benefit dependency. It states that the people of Sweden can be divided into [...] "fools" [...] and [...] "sleepy-brains", out of which the former stands for those who work, and the latter for the slackened people who depend on funds from the welfare state.
