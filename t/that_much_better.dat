500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the game that has {{attracted}} criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from Final Fantasy X. One reviewer at RPGamer commented that [...] "there is little question that the graphics in Final Fantasy X-2 could rival just about any other RPG on the market ... one does not get ... that the graphics have been improved in any significant way since Final Fantasy X", while GameSpot said [...] "X-2 doesn't look <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than X did two years ago". Electronic Gaming Monthly regarded this reuse of code as [...] " [...] in the one area where Final Fantasy titles usually shine".|$|E
500|$|Erica Durance {{has been}} {{nominated}} for two Saturn Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actress category for her performance as Lois Lane. The first came in 2005, after her first season with the show, and then again the following year. Before the end of Smallville's seventh season, IGN's Daniel Phillips compared the actresses who have portrayed the character of Lois Lane {{over the past three}} decades. Up against the most recognizable version of Lois Lane, Margot Kidder, the 2006 film incarnation played by Kate Bosworth, and the previous live-action television version portrayed by Teri Hatcher, Erica Durance was rated the highest. Although Phillips acknowledges that Kidder is the best representation of Lois' personality, he claims that Durance is the best overall embodiment of the character. Apart from her beauty, Phillips states, [...] "Durance makes Lois intelligent, capable, funny and dangerously curious – exactly the type of woman Clark Kent would fall for." [...] Mike Moody of TV Squad named Lois as one of five reasons to watch Smallville's eighth season. Moody believes that Durance's Lois is [...] "one of the best versions of the character" [...] because Durance plays her as [...] "tough, brainy, sexy and catty", which makes her portrayal <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane in Superman Returns. BuddyTV's John Kubicek likens the actress's performance—her [...] "stylized delivery of lines"—to that of actresses from the 1940s screwball comedy era.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of his {{freshman}} year, Frazier recorded a team-high 34-inch vertical in Penn State's preseason workouts. He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, [...] "Billy Oliver, Sasa , Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in this yet, so it was important just to get out there." [...] In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time. He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench. He shot 6-of-11 from the field, and 4-of-5 on three-pointers. Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain. If he starts making perimeter shots, then we're <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> We've seen him where he can make shots in practice and do pretty well. We just needed to get him some confidence and get him into the flow." [...] The game would remain a season-high for him under the scoring category. Frazier was awarded his first start as a shooting guard on November 22, 2009 against Davidson; he registered 7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. He recorded a season-high 34 minutes. He finished the 2009–10 season averaging 5.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.7 turnovers. He played in all 31 regular season games.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1971, The Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds made a {{trade that}} was one of the most {{impactful}} in the history of the sport, and helped create [...] "The Big Red Machine" [...] of the 1970s, with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. [...] The [...] Astros sent second baseman Joe Morgan, infielder Denis Menke, pitcher Jack Billingham, and outfielders César Gerónimo and prospect Ed Armbrister to Cincinnati for first baseman Lee May, second baseman Tommy Helms and infielder Jim Stewart. [...] The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world scratching their heads as to why Astros General Manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. [...] May and Helms were good talents but both had obvious weaknesses. [...] The Reds on the other hand would shore up many problems. They had an off-year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1970. [...] They had plenty of power at the plate in Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Lee May. The problem was, they were all right-handed batters and two of the three were first basemen. [...] Three sluggers batting in a row in the middle of the Reds lineup caused issues: First, it left them vulnerable to right-handed pitching; next, there was the problem of double play balls killing a rally; finally, Perez, a first baseman, was placed at third in order to have both May and Perez in the line-up. [...] Perez at third base caused a fielding weakness. [...] Now with Menke, a proven veteran that could play third, Perez could move to first, thus strengthening the left side of the field. [...] They also got the 6ft 4in Billigham, who was just entering his prime as a pitcher and would go on to help lead the Big Red Machine to back-to-back World Series in 1975 and 1976. [...] The deal turned out to be more than just Morgan for May, but Morgan turning out to be a great second baseman for the Astros, to a second baseman that would turn out to be an all-time great, just made the deal <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for the Reds.|$|E

Thus, we learn the value of the coal we buy; we know to a tee the last penny of cost of every item of production, and we learn which firemen are the most wasteful, which firemen, out of stupidity or carelessness, get the least out of the coal they fire."
