5|$|In contrast, however, many Christian evangelists {{and church}} {{organizations}} {{took a more}} supportive role. For example, <b>televangelist</b> Jim Bakker expressed {{public support for the}} group Stryper, watching them perform and becoming personal friends with the band's members.

5|$|American <b>televangelist</b> Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} {{prominent}} Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history. He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly {{in the direction of}} world government for the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Wealth is {{interpreted}} in prosperity theology as a blessing from God, obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms; Kenneth Copeland, an American author and <b>televangelist,</b> argues that prosperity {{is governed by}} laws, while other teachers portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.|$|E

50|$|The Trinity Foundation has an {{extensive}} video library of <b>televangelists.</b> They routinely take {{notes of the}} <b>televangelists</b> broadcasts.

5|$|Sanchez takes Bond to his base, {{which is}} {{disguised}} as {{the headquarters of}} a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in petrol and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The <b>televangelist</b> Professor Joe Butcher serves as middleman, working under Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts {{a fire in the}} laboratory, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder.

50|$|Anthony's investigative {{work into}} the {{fundraising}} tactics of big-money <b>televangelists</b> {{first came to}} national attention in 1991 following a Primetime Live hidden-camera investigation of <b>televangelists.</b> Anthony portrayed himself—a Dallas minister of a small church trying to learn how big-money ministries work—in the segment on fellow East Dallas minister Robert Tilton. Anthony and the Trinity Foundation were instrumental in providing evidence for the many state and Federal investigations of Tilton {{in the years that}} followed, and he is often interviewed by reporters in preparations for stories on other <b>televangelists.</b> He was also the subject of a lengthy profile in the December 6, 2004 issue of The New Yorker.|$|R

He ended the arrangement with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries after differences arose.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded in}} 2011 with no penalties or findings of wrongdoing.

25|$|From then {{until her}} {{renunciation}} of the Church of Satan in 1990, Zeena appeared in such nationally syndicated programs as The Phil Donahue Show, Nightline with Ted Koppel, Entertainment Tonight, The Late Show, Secrets & Mysteries and the Sally Jesse Raphael Show.

5000|$|Researcher and {{bioethics}} expert Fred M. Frohock cited Popoff as [...] "one of many egregious {{instances of}} fake healing." [...] Ole Anthony of the Trinity Foundation, which has investigated <b>televangelists</b> since 1987, said, [...] "Most {{of these guys}} are fooled by their own theology", referring to other <b>televangelists</b> he considers scammers, including Joel Osteen and T. D. Jakes; {{but in the case}} of Popoff, [...] "He's fundamentally evil, because he knows he's a con man." ...|$|R
25|$|The news {{coverage}} generated by Randi's exposé on The Tonight Show led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's TV show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987.

25|$|Graham was {{a spiritual}} adviser to American presidents; he was {{particularly}} close to Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson (one of Graham's closest friends) and Richard Nixon. He insisted on integration for his revivals and crusades in 1953 and invited Martin Luther King Jr. to preach jointly at a revival in New York City in 1957. Graham bailed King out of jail in the 1960s when King was arrested in demonstrations. He was also lifelong friends with another <b>televangelist</b> and founding pastor of the Crystal Cathedral, Robert H. Schuller, whom Graham talked into doing his own television ministry.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} release {{contained a}} song called [...] "Yellow Fever", which was about having sex with Asian women, {{as well as a}} hidden track on track number 69 on the original release.

5000|$|Several <b>televangelists</b> {{are very}} active in the {{national}} or international political arena (e.g., Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart, John Hagee), and often espouse conservative politics on their programs. Such <b>televangelists</b> may occasionally arouse controversy by making remarks deemed offensive on their programs or elsewhere, or by endorsing partisan political candidates on donor-paid airtime, at which point some have been threatened {{that they may have}} their tax-exempt status taken away if they reside in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, televangelism has emerged as one {{important}} media phenomenon, inter alia, among Muslim communities. As a phenomenon, televangelism is interesting in many respects; it is {{a manifestation of the}} phenomenon of "info-tainment" as <b>televangelists</b> integrate entertainment features such as sound effects and music in their sermons. It is also a manifestation of the rise of the celebrity culture as <b>televangelists</b> have become 'media celebrities' with thousands of hundreds of fans and followers on social media networks.   Thematically, this study is divided into two main sections. First. I delineate the characteristics of televangelism as a novel form of religious expression in which <b>televangelists</b> adopt a modern style and use colloquial language; and in which <b>televangelists</b> present religion as a source of individual change. I have argued that these features seem to have granted <b>televangelists</b> popularity particularly among Muslim youth who view televangelism as a new form of religious expression that is modern in appearance and relevant to their everyday lives. The study has further highlighted the importance of digital media technologies in popularizing televangelists' programmes and sermons. Drawing on two case studies of popular <b>televangelists,</b> namely Amr Khaled and Hamza Yusuf, the study has shown that <b>televangelists</b> draw on a plethora of digital media tools to extend the visibility of their programmes including websites and social media networks. The study has found that televangelists' fans {{play an important role in}} popularizing televangelists' programmes. Moreover, the study relates televangelism to the rise of digital Islam. The study has argued that digitization and the increase of literacy rates have changed the structure of religious authority in the twenty first century, giving rise to new voices that are competing for authority.   Having provided an explanatory framework for the phenomenon of televangelism, the study moves in the second section to critique televangelism as an 'info-tainment' phenomenon. Drawing on Carrette and King's Selling Spirituality, one issue that the study raises is the extent to which televangelism fits into the modern form of 'spiritualities'. Rather than being a critical reflection of the consumer culture, modern spiritualities seem to 'smooth out' resistance to the hegemony of capitalism and consumerism. I have proposed that it is through a content-related analysis of televangelists' sermons that one can get a nuanced understanding of how the discourses of particular <b>televangelists</b> can possibly relate to dominant (capitalist) ideologies, how structures of power are represented in their discourses and what their texts may reveal about the socio-historical contexts of Muslims in the twenty first century...|$|R
50|$|Some U.S. <b>televangelists</b> such as Robert Tilton and Peter Popoff buy {{television}} {{time from}} infomercial brokers representing television {{stations around the}} U.S. and even some widely distributed cable networks that are not averse to carrying religious programming. A block of such programming appears weekdays on BET under the umbrella title BET Inspiration (which fully replaced the direct response variety of infomercials on the channel in 1997). The vast majority of religious programming in the United States is distributed through paid infomercial time; the fees that <b>televangelists</b> pay for coverage on most religious stations are a major revenue stream for those stations, in addition to programming the networks produce themselves (the {{money to pay for}} this air time comes mainly through listener donations, with less scrupulous <b>televangelists</b> using hard sell tactics to coerce faithful viewers to send money, sometimes by using a variant of the prosperity gospel).|$|R
500|$|The tour's {{concept was}} {{inspired}} by disparate television programming, coverage of the Gulf War, the desensitising effect of mass media, and [...] "morning zoo" [...] radio shows. The stage featured dozens of large video screens that showed visual effects, video clips, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant automobiles. Channel surfing, prank calls, video confessionals, a belly dancer, and live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo were incorporated into the shows. On stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including the leather-clad egomaniac [...] "The Fly", the greedy <b>televangelist</b> [...] "Mirror Ball Man", and the devilish [...] "MacPhisto". In contrast to other U2 tours, each of the Zoo TV shows opened with six to eight consecutive new songs before older material was played.|$|E
500|$|Not {{only was}} Christian metal criticized by non-Christian metal fans, {{but soon the}} {{movement}} was also criticized by fundamentalists; Allmusic wrote that [...] "when church leaders were accusing heavy metal of encouraging Satanism, Stryper set out to prove that metal and hard rock {{could be used to}} promote Christianity. The southern California band was viewed with suspicion by both ministers (who refused to believe that Christianity and metal were compatible) and fellow headbangers—and yet, Stryper managed to sell millions of albums to both Christian and secular audiences." [...] For example, the <b>televangelist</b> Jimmy Swaggart wrote a book titled Religious Rock n' Roll – A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing in 1987 and criticized the scene, particularly Stryper, for using heavy metal music to preach the gospel of Christianity. Many new bands began to arise, eventually drawing the attention of record labels that specialized in Christian music.|$|E
500|$|Like Achtung Baby, the 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal {{break with}} the band's past. In {{contrast}} to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill [...] "sensory overload" [...] in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant automobiles. Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, the group's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating; on stage, Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including the leather-clad egomaniac [...] "The Fly", the greedy <b>televangelist</b> [...] "Mirror Ball Man", and the devilish [...] "MacPhisto". Prank phone calls were made to President Bush, the United Nations, and others. Live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo caused controversy. Zoo TV was the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, earning US$67million.|$|E
