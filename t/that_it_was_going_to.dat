5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Hype Williams and was filmed in downtown Los Angeles. Filming of the video involved a partial closure of the 2nd Street Tunnel and part of downtown Los Angeles spread out over a 48-hour period. Kesha explained the idea behind the video {{as well as the}} experience during an interview with MTV News; she said that the video was different from her other videos, noting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show a sexier side of herself.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce its}} commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, {{to try to}} attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled {{at the end of}} 1963.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the company}} managed {{to cover it}} costs, and the company stated that it hoped to have a revenue of NOK 30 million the {{following}} year, through an ambitious expansion plan. A private offering for NOK 8 million was issued to allow this expansion. Among the purchasers was the Municipality of Narvik and Narvik Port Authority. In March, Chair Rune Arnøy was forced to withdraw after accusations of conflict of interest, since he was both chair of Ofotbanen and harbormaster at the Port of Narvik. CargoNet, a freight competitor of Ofotbanen, had {{felt that they were}} being unfairly treated by the port after the municipality had bought shares in Ofotbanen and appointed Arnøy as chair. The legality of the port's purchase of the shares was considered by the Norwegian Coastal Administration; though deemed legal, the port authority was required to sell the shares within three years. In April, Ofotbanen received a permit to operate in Sweden, and started offering charter trains between Narvik and Kiruna in Sweden, primarily for cruise ship passengers. It also announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bid for the public service obligations for subsidized passenger railway transport that the government was planning to conduct in 2006. In June, Ofotbanen received permission to operate freight trains throughout the entire railway network in Norway. This was the first time such permission was granted to a different company than NSB or its subsidiaries.|$|E

25|$|Miles {{promised that}} the company would stay {{headquartered}} in Birmingham (the city where the company was founded {{and a majority of}} employees were located), in 2011. In 2014, though, when the company announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be publicly traded, SEC filings showed the headquarters as Plano, Texas. Reasons given for the shift included simplifying travel, a lack of talent available in Birmingham (the talent source for the companies initial growth and development), and the need to consolidate offices to prepare for an IPO. Local media, business, and civic leaders said they were unaware of the move.|$|E

However, on 28 July 2015, the Supreme Court issued a statement in denounced the International Commission demands. In response, Guatemalan newspaper Diario La Hora reveals that the thirteen judges of the Supreme Court were designated thanks to the alliance between the official Partido Patriota and the main opposition party, Libertad Democrática Renovada.

25|$|The flights {{across the}} Tasman {{initially}} operated twice weekly (on Tuesdays and Saturdays), but dropped to one flight a week during off-peak months before winter services were suspended entirely in 2014. In October 2014, the Rotorua District Council decided, {{in conjunction with}} Air New Zealand, to stop subsidising the service as they felt that the amount they were funding, which equated to around $1 million per year, could be better spent on other initiatives. Therefore, {{it was announced that}} flights to Sydney would cease, and the final international flight from the airport was on 25 April 2015. Following the discontinuation of international flights, the airport stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> focus on strengthening domestic routes and was specifically interested in initiating non-stop flights to Queenstown.|$|E

The air liaison teams attached to the corps and Panzer Divisions were directed to report the battle situation at the front, but were forbidden to advise the army, or request air support. The army sent separate reports, under the same conditions. The reports were digested by Kleist and Richthofen's chiefs of staff, and action was or was not taken with mutual agreement. Attack orders could be delivered in minutes to air units. A Gruppe (Group) of Ju 87s and Bf 109s was ready in reserve to respond, and could do so within 45 to 70 minutes. Fliegerkorps VIII and Richthofen {{were led to believe}} they would spend the entire campaign supporting Reichenau in northern Belgium, but the OKL did not inform the Corps <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be used in a Meuse river breakthrough.|$|E
25|$|By 1994, Novell {{had largely}} {{given up on}} {{attempting}} to make NetWare into a complete alternative operating system, and started selling off many of the companies it had acquired {{only a few years}} earlier. They had minimally promoted Btrieve, largely due to the delay (24 months) in releasing version 6. Negotiations between The Woodward's and Novell were entered into, and after two years Novell announced (26 Jan, 1994) <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> transfer ownership of Btrieve to Btrieve Technologies, Incorporated (also known as BTI). On 29 April 1994, the transfer was completed and Nancy Woodward became the Chairman of BTI and Doug Woodward was made the Chief Technical Officer.
