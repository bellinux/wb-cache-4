5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi differ by only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. <b>These</b> <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> that the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E
25|$|Pitch {{constancy}} {{refers to}} the ability to perceive pitch identity across changes in acoustical properties, such as loudness, temporal envelope, or timbre. The importance of cortical regions lateral to A1 for pitch coding is also supported by studies of human cortical lesions and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain. <b>These</b> <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> a hierarchical system for pitch processing, with more abstract properties of sound stimulus processed further along the processing pathways.|$|E
25|$|Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) is a triplet repeat disease {{characterized}} by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, ophthalmoplegia, and polyneuropathy. Since muscle cramps are a frequent occurrence in MJD, axonal hyperexcitability {{has been considered}} {{to play a role}} in the disease. Research has demonstrated that the strength-duration time constant in MJD patients is significantly longer than in controls, and this corresponds to a significant reduction in rheobase. Combined with findings on Na+ channel blockers, <b>these</b> <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> that the cramps in MJD are likely caused by the increased persistent Na+ channel conductance that may be unregulated during axonal reinnervation (which results from long-term axonal degeneration).|$|E

2500|$|Primary {{sequence}} analysis of OSM allocates {{it to the}} gp130 group of cytokines. OSM most resembles LIF, bearing 22% sequence identity and 30% similarity. Incidentally the genes for OSM and LIF occur in tandem on human chromosome 22. Both LIF and OSM genes have very similar gene structures sharing similar promoter elements and intron-exon structure. <b>These</b> <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> that OSM and LIF arose relatively recently in evolutionary terms by gene duplication. Of the five cysteine residues within the human OSM sequence four participate in disulfide bridges, one of these disulfide bonds namely between helices A and B is necessary for OSM activity. [...] The free cysteine residue {{does not appear to}} mediate dimerisation of OSM.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{downhill}} folding {{is difficult}} to measure experimentally, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have been performed on fast-folding proteins to explore their folding kinetics. Proteins whose folding rate is {{at or near the}} folding [...] "speed limit", whose timescales make their folding more accessible to simulation methods, may more commonly fold downhill. Simulation studies of the BBL protein imply that its rapid folding rate and very low energy barrier arise from a lack of cooperativity in the formation of native contacts during the folding process; that is, a low contact order. The link between lack of cooperativity and low contact order was also observed in the context of Monte Carlo lattice simulations [...] <b>These</b> <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> that the average number of [...] "nonlocal contacts" [...] per residue in a protein serves as an indicator of the barrier height, where very low nonlocal contact values imply downhill folding. Coarse-grained simulations by Knott and Chan also support the experimental observation [...] of global downhill folding in BBL.|$|E
2500|$|Farming, {{rather than}} just reduced sunlight, may have helped trigger pale skin in Europeans. In a 2007 study, almost all Africans and East Asians have one allele of the SLC24A5 gene, whereas 98% of the Europeans studied had the other. [...] <b>These</b> <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> that a {{selective}} sweep occurred as recently as 5,300 to 6,000 years ago, replacing darker skins with light skins at astonishing speed. It implies that Europeans had been dark-skinned {{for tens of thousands}} of years. Several decades ago, Stanford's Cavalli-Sforza had argued that European hunter-gatherers, herders and fishers could have survived from the vitamin D content of their diet alone. Only when farming took hold did Europeans—replacing meat and fish with grain—need to absorb more sunlight to produce vitamin D in their skin. Other writers, including Darwin, Miller, and Dawkins, have proposed that skin-colour changes were driven by sexual selection. Cochran and Harpending reject the sexual-selection idea when used to imply that race is no more than skin deep ("perhaps little more than a fad"), pointing out that experts can easily determine race from skeletal evidence alone.|$|E
