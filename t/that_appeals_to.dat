25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the GCF concerns the creation of the Fund's Private Sector Facility (PSF). Many of the developed countries represented on the GCF board advocate a PSF <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> capital markets, in particular the pension funds and other institutional investors that control trillions of dollars that pass through Wall Street and other financial centers. They hope that the Fund will ultimately use a broad range of financial instruments.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the policy}} of the Australian Labor Party from 1908 <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> the Privy Council should be abolished, it took no {{legislative}} action to implement that policy, and appeals to the Privy Council never became a major political issue. There were calls among lawyers and academics in the 1950s for the abolition of such appeals, however there was no legislative response until 1968, abolishing appeals in matters involving federal legislation, 1975, abolishing almost all appeals from the High Court, and 1986 which abolished appeals from State Courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitless}} {{nature of}} {{appeals to the}} House of Lords {{was the cause of}} much concern, involving an additional set of expensive and time-consuming appeals from the Court of Appeal that could not necessarily set decisions down in the knowledge that they were final. The appeals from the County Courts were seen similarly, involving an appeal to the High Court of Justice and the bypassing of the Court of Appeal for a second set of appeals to the Lords. The Administration of Justice (Appeals) Act 1934, a short statute, solved both problems neatly by abolishing the appeal of County decisions to the High Court and instead sending them automatically to the Court of Appeal, and by establishing <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> the Lords could only take place with the consent of the Court of Appeal or the Lords themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheduling}} of Panorama has, {{since the}} 1980s, often been {{a subject of}} media debate and controversy, due to {{the duties of the}} BBC to provide both on the one hand entertaining programming <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> a mass audience, and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30pm, after the Nine O'Clock News. Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yenotob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10pm, {{to make way for the}} sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was side-lining serious content in favour of lighter programming.|$|E

25|$|Because of her {{participation}} in the musical, {{it took a long}} time for Beni to release new material. When the musical stopped touring in 2006, she began modeling as the face of Cecil McBee, one of the largest and most popular Japanese clothing lines <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> teenage and college girls. She was also the host of the NHK fashion program, Tokyo Kawaii TV, where Beni discusses the latest fashion trends in Japan. When she became the face of Orion Beer a new single was announced to be released on September 20. Her seventh single was named How Are U?. This single was her first single not to chart on the Oricon chart and is considered a total flop. Her eighth single named Luna was an ending theme song for the Japanese drama Warui Yatsura. This single charted at the No. 77 spot making it a small comeback from Beni. On April 25, 2007, Beni released her third studio album named Gem. The album charted at the No. 114 place on the Oricon chart.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Yuji Horii and {{his team}} at Chunsoft began {{production}} on Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior). After Enix published the game in early 1986, it became the template for future console RPGs. The game {{was influenced by the}} first-person random battles in Wizardry, the overhead movement in , and the mystery storytelling in Horii's own 1983 visual novel game Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii's intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general. This required {{the creation of a new}} kind of RPG, that didn't rely on previous D experience, didn't require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and that could appeal to any kind of gamer. Compared to statistics-heavy computer RPGs, Dragon Quest was a more streamlined, faster-paced game based on exploration and combat, and featured a top-down view in dungeons, in contrast to the first-person view used for dungeons in earlier computer RPGs. The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs. The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, building on Horii's previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case, but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to, making use of the RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this. It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs, like major quests interwoven with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre, alongside anime-style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music.|$|E

Fellow dissident Rene Gomez Manzano, on the other hand, was critical of the Project, stating <b>that</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> the Communist-Party-controlled NAPP were futile; similarly, other Cuban exiles criticized the initiative for what they considered its implicit acceptance of the legitimacy of the Castro regime and its constitution.|$|E
