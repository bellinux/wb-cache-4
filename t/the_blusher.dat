If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with <b>the</b> <b>blusher</b> (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
60|$|The {{belief that}} {{blushing}} was SPECIALLY {{designed by the}} Creator is opposed to {{the general theory of}} evolution, which is now so largely accepted; but it forms no part of my duty here to argue on the general question. Those who believe in design, will find it difficult to account for shyness being the most frequent and efficient of all the causes of blushing, as it makes <b>the</b> <b>blusher</b> to suffer and the beholder uncomfortable, without being of the least service to either of them. They will also find it difficult to account for negroes and other dark-coloured races blushing, in whom a change of colour in the skin is scarcely or not at all visible.|$|E

40|$|Blushing is {{restricted}} to the facial area that is uncovered {{and in the center}} of social attention. Together with the observation that blushing typically occurs in interpersonal situations, it has been proposed that <b>the</b> <b>blush</b> might have acquired signaling properties with relevant social implications. Following such a functional perspective, this article evaluates the signal value and social effects of <b>the</b> <b>blush.</b> First, it is argued that <b>the</b> <b>blush</b> fulfils all criteria for being a reliable social signal. It seems impossible to fake or to suppress, and it seems to co-occur with a specific mental state: The acute awareness that one’s goal of esteem before others is at stake. Second, it is illustrated that the social effects of <b>the</b> <b>blush</b> may greatly vary as a function of context. In contexts that clearly imply some kind of misbehavior, <b>the</b> <b>blush</b> has face-saving properties. Yet, in many other contexts, such as merely being the center of attention or situations that are ambiguous with regard to the blushing actors’ antecedent behaviors, <b>the</b> <b>blush</b> may have undesirable effects. Third, it is illustrated that the signal value of <b>the</b> <b>blush</b> not only affects the observers but also the blushing actors. It is shown that the anticipated influence of one’s blushing on other people’s judgments may help explain why actors often consider blushing as a highly undesirable response, and why some people may even develop a phobic fear of blushing...|$|R

5000|$|Several {{different}} {{psychological and}} psycho-physiological mechanisms for blushing have been hypothesized by Crozier (2010): [...] "An explanation that emphasises the blush’s visibility proposes {{that when we}} feel shame we communicate our emotion to others {{and in doing so}} we send an important signal to them. It tells them something about us. It shows that we are ashamed or embarrassed, that we recognise that something is out of place. It shows that we are sorry about this. It shows that we want to put things right. To blush at innuendo is to show awareness of its implications and to display modesty that conveys that you are not brazen or shameless. The blush makes a particularly effective signal because it is involuntary and uncontrollable. Of course, a blush can be unwanted the costs to <b>the</b> <b>blusher</b> on specific occasions are outweighed by the long-term benefits of being seen as adhering to the group and by the general advantages the blush provides: indeed the costs may enhance the signal’s perceived value." [...] A number of techniques may be used to help prevent or reduce blushing.|$|E

I examine these themes and compare them with current psychological accounts which assign a central place to embarrassment and, more specifically, emphasise either unwanted social attention, exposure of the self, or <b>the</b> <b>blush's</b> signalling function. Analysis of Austen's work suggests that greater attention should be paid to self-consciousness {{as it relates to}} threats to reputation, to the erotic dimension of <b>the</b> <b>blush,</b> and to potential gender differences. It should encourage researchers to be aware of limitations of psychological accounts and to expand their range of sources of information in order to enhance understanding of this elusive phenomenon...|$|R
