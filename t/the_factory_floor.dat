5|$|The train {{carrying}} {{the women and}} children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor</b> and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only be done on <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor,</b> separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E

5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor</b> to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

The CDA arrests Waternoose and it is revealed that Roz the monster in charge of paperwork is CDA #1 to which she orders Sulley and Mike to return Boo home and has her door shredded to prevent any more contact with her.|$|E

25|$|Frederick Winslow Taylor (March 20, 1856 – March 21, 1915) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer {{who sought to}} improve industrial efficiency. He {{was one of the}} first management consultants. Taylor was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and his ideas, broadly conceived, were highly influential in the Progressive Era (1890s-1920s). Taylor summed up his efficiency techniques in his 1911 book The Principles of Scientific Management, which in 2001 Fellows of the Academy of Management voted the most influential management book of the twentieth century. His pioneering work in applying engineering principles to the work done on <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor</b> was instrumental in the creation and development of the branch of engineering that is now known as industrial engineering. Taylor made his name in, and was most proud of his work in, scientific management; however, he made his fortune patenting steel-process improvements.

2500|$|Author A.R. Weyl (Fokker: the {{creative}} years, Putnam 1965) says that, while Fokker was a talented and bold pilot, his business character was more flawed. He failed to reinvest war profits {{back into his}} factory which consequentially struggled to fulfill war contracts as <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor</b> was often muddled with prototype development and production taking {{place at the same}} time. Fokker distrusted qualified engineers (which he was not) and resented frequent German insistence on carrying out stringent structural tests to ensure prototype aircraft were fit for combat. He could be bad tempered and insensitive as when he verbally abused his dying designer Martin Kreuzer on the evening of 27 June 1916, after Kreuzer had crashed the prototype Fokker D.I. The rudder jammed but Kreuzer was able to give a verbal report on the accident before he died. [...] "Fokker hurried to the scene and shouted reproaches at the mortally injured man". Weyl says this incident was witnessed by Reinhold Platz, who succeeded Kreuzer.|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor.</b> We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E

We analyse a particular type of HMS called a holonic assembly system which focuses on flexible control, transportation, transformation and storage of parts for assembling value-added products.

To facilitate the widespread adoption and deployment of HMS technology, a comprehensive conceptual model is required.

60|$|Here {{he saw the}} {{important}} and delicate core again carefully tested as to its electrical condition, after which it received a new jacket of tanned jute yarn {{to protect it from}} the iron top coat yet to come. Its jute jacket on, it was then coiled away in tanks full of water, where it was constantly kept submerged and continuously tested for insulation. Last of all the top coat was put on. This consisted of ten wires of peculiarly fine and strong iron. Each of these ten wires had put on it a special coat of its own, made of tarred Manilla yarn, to protect it from rust as well as to lighten its specific gravity. The core being brought from its tank, and passed round several sheaves, which carried it below <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> <b>floor,</b> was drawn up {{through a hole in the}} centre of a circular table, around the circumference of which were ten drums of the Manilla-covered wire. A stout iron rod, fastened to the circumference of the table, rose from between each drum to the ceiling, converging in a cone which passed through to the floor above. Our core rose in the middle of all, and went through the hollow of the cone. When all was put in noisy and bewildering motion, the core which rose from the turning-table and whirling drums as a thin jute-clad line, came out in the floor above a stout iron-clad cable, with a Manilla top-dressing, possessing strength sufficient to bear eleven miles of its own length perpendicularly suspended in water--or a margin of strength more than four and a half times that required,--and with a breaking strain of seven tons fifteen hundredweight.|$|E
