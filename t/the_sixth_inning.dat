5|$|Philadelphia {{scored in}} the first inning for the third {{consecutive}} game, taking a 2–0 lead when Shane Victorino and Pedro Feliz batted in Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell respectively. Tampa Bay cut the lead in half in the fourth inning; Carlos Peña doubled and was batted in on Evan Longoria's single, both players' first hits of the Series. The Rays then tied the game in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> when B. J. Upton scored from second base on a Peña single. The game was suspended after the top of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> due to rain, making it the first game in World Series history to not be played through to completion or declared a tie.|$|E
5|$|Steve Woodard {{received}} an unusual no-decision in 2000, when the team's Opening Day {{game against the}} Cincinnati Reds was called in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> due to rain, with the score tied at 3. This was the first Opening Day tie game since 1965.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his MLB debut, the league {{investigated}} Nova and fellow Yankees pitching prospect Wilkins de la Rosa for injecting each other with Vitamin B12. Overall, Nova made seven starts for the Yankees in 2010, pitching to a 1–2 record and a 4.50 ERA. Nova reached <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> only once, however, as he allowed a higher opponents' batting average and ERA in the fifth inning than in the first four. The Yankees did not include Nova on their postseason roster.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers scored {{their only}} {{run in the}} bottom of the fourth as Dusty Baker singled, {{advanced}} to second on an error, and scored on another single. They threatened again in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> loading the bases, though they failed to score. That was the only inning after the fourth in which a Dodgers' runner reached scoring position. Niekro steadied again after the sixth, allowing just one baserunner on a two-out ninth-inning single over the remaining three innings.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians {{were out in the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Red Sox began to fight back in the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b> After getting Pesky out, Ted Williams reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E
5|$|Zobrist {{scored the}} Royals' first {{run in the}} first inning on a force play. In the bottom of the first inning, Wright hit a two-run home run that also scored Granderson. For the Royals, Alex Ríos drove Salvador Pérez home in the second inning, and scored on a passed ball by d'Arnaud, giving the Royals a 3–2 lead. After a Syndergaard single, Granderson hit a two-run home run just over the right field wall in the third inning, and the Mets took a 4–3 lead. The Mets added a run in the fourth inning on an RBI single by Conforto, and four more in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> {{including}} an RBI single by Juan Uribe, in his first at bat since September 20. The Royals made a few uncharacteristic mistakes in this game, the first coming in the fourth inning when pitcher Yordano Ventura forgot to cover the base on a ground ball to the first baseman, and the second in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> when Royals pitcher Franklin Morales triple-clutched Granderson's ground ball, allowing all runners to be safe, which led to a 2-run single by Wright.|$|E

5|$|From July 10 to August 31, Richard {{racked up}} eight {{complete}} games, including one shutout, and he improved his record from 9–9 to 16–13. He pitched 98innings and yielded only 22 earned runs, {{which gave him}} an ERA of 2.02 during the approximately 50-day span. On August 26, Richard hit his first home run of the season during the second inning of the game. In his last {{game of the season}} on October 2, Richard pitched a complete game 13-strikeout performance, and he also hit a two-run home run in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b>|$|E
5|$|His first no-hitter, on July 12, 1951, was a 1–0 {{defeat of}} his former team, the Indians. Gene Woodling's solo home run was the only run scored during the game. Reynolds retired the last 17 Indians he faced. Only four Indians reached base; he walked three and Bobby Ávila reached on an error by Phil Rizzuto. It was his third shutout of Cleveland that season. Bob Feller also threw a strong game and didn't allow a hit until <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> when Mickey Mantle doubled. Feller threw a {{complete}} game and allowed only four hits. Feller had thrown a no-hitter eleven days earlier.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> Howard's {{home run}} {{following}} a walk issued to Utley brought {{the game to}} 7–3. After Ibáñez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte, allowing no further runs in the inning. In {{the top of the}} eighth inning, Dámaso Marte struck out Howard, which set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by a batter in a single series (13). After the strikeout, Marte was relieved by Rivera in a non-save situation, who allowed one hit and one walk before closing out the game and the Yankees' 27th championship.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Uribe and Kelly Johnson to the New York Mets for John Gant and Rob Whalen. During {{his second}} game with New York, Uribe hit the walk-off {{single in the}} tenth inning {{to win the game}} for the Mets, 3–2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Uribe missed the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series due to a chest {{contusion}} in September, but was added to the Mets' World Series roster and came off the bench in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> of Game 3 to deliver a pinch-hit single, driving in a run.|$|E
5|$|The game {{then became}} a pitcher's duel; Maglie and Newcombe did not allow a hit in {{the third or fourth}} innings. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled on a bunt, and Thomson hit a double, but the score {{remained}} 1–0 through five innings. Duke Snider singled in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> but was caught stealing second. Neither team got another hit until the seventh inning. Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin led off the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E

5|$|Hamels was {{selected}} the Phillies starter for Game 1 of the World Series; the Phillies won 3–2, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game 5, which was suspended due to rain after {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> tied at 2-2, and receiving a no-decision; when Game 5 resumed the Phillies won 4-3 to clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA. Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he never allowed more than one run {{in any of the}} seven innings in which he did not hold opponents scoreless. Hamels was named the 2008 World Series MVP.|$|E
5|$|Humber nearly {{achieved}} a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 25, 2011, {{in the sixth}} start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, with one out, Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle, leaving Humber to finish with seven scoreless innings. Later that year he took a no-hitter into <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. broke up the no-hitter leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch {{to break up the}} perfect game in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into a double play to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E

Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the mound, {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz grounded out on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a double play, ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on the mound, and retired the side in order. <b>The</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E
