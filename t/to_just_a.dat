5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|By early 1945, {{following}} the Solomon Islands campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the once formidable Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet was reduced <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> handful of operational warships {{and a few}} remaining aircraft and aircrew. Most of the remaining Japanese warships in the Combined Fleet were stationed at ports in Japan, {{with most of the}} large ships at Kure, Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|The Coronation {{class was}} {{probably}} painted in more styles of livery {{than any other}} engine class, seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That {{does not mean that}} all 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and the entire class was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E

5|$|As B Company moved forward, {{their left}} flank was engaged by a machine-gun {{from a small}} party of Viet Cong to their front, while sniper fire intensified. The Australians {{continued}} to advance with co-ordinated fire and movement, but were now receiving fire from three directions. Ten minutes after stepping off, B Company crossed the front of A Company, forcing them to cease their covering fire. Without support, the Australians were now assaulting a well dug-in and largely unseen Viet Cong force that was disposed in a wide arc. Penetrating the position, the Australian flanks were increasingly exposed to fire, while the dense undergrowth obscured the Viet Cong pits and reduced visibility <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few metres. Both the lead Australian platoons were soon enveloped, as fire swept {{across the front of}} B Company from the Viet Cong engaging them with heavy machine-guns, claymore mines and light mortars. Meanwhile, Viet Cong snipers continued to engage the Australians from the rear, who unsuccessfully attempted to regain the initiative with small arms fire and grenades. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties.|$|E
5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{introduced}} species that harm Lord Howe's native flora and fauna, feral pigs and cats were eradicated by the early 2000s. The goat population has been reduced <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few animals, and there are ongoing efforts to control rodents and introduced plants. In July 2012 it was announced by the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker that the Australian and NSW Governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for the island, using aerial deployment of poison baits. The plan was put to a local vote and is considered controversial. A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> small fraction of the state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open {{in the event of a}} future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E

5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{were the}} {{dominant}} group in the Southwest from the 1750s to the 1830s, and the domain they ruled was an empire known as Comanchería. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, and Coahuila and Nueva Vizcaya in northern Mexico, they worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. Their empire collapsed after the Spanish era as their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera in the late 1840s; the population plunged from 20,000 <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few thousand by the 1870s. The Comanches were {{no longer able to}} deal with the U.S. Army, which took over control of the region after the Mexican American War ended in 1848.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few hundred men.|$|E

At one extreme the greater shearwater nests in concentrations of 1 pair per square metre in three colonies of more than 1 million pairs, whereas the giant petrels nest in clumped but widely spaced territories that barely qualify as colonial. Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes (such as the Barau's petrel).|$|E

5|$|A trip to The Dell on 3 October {{was taken}} with caution given United's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground. The team lost to Southampton {{in each of}} their last three visits, {{including}} a 6–3 mauling in 1996. Despite dominating possession and clear-cut chances in the previous season’s fixture, United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when, not if he would eventually break the jinx. Andy Cole was paired with Yorke {{for only the second}} time this season, a tactic that paid off as both got on the score sheet. Substitute Jordi Cruyff added a third in the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table, four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break. Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon, a match that Manchester United won 5–1, the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, Beckham, Yorke and Cole (twice) all scored; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19-year-old defender Wes Brown. United earned a point away at Derby County on 24 October, and deservedly beat Everton 4–1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> point.|$|E

5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase ramped up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E
5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
