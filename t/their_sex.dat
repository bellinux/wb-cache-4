5|$|The Land of Gorch {{segments}} {{deal with}} adult themes; characters use euphemisms {{to refer to}} <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> drives and often consume alcohol. They often contradict each other and act obnoxiously and lasciviously. They grapple with adult issues including death, sexual intercourse, and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Sattler assists the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, in {{a search}} for survivors, but they only find an injured Malcolm, before the Tyrannosaurus returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. Later, they {{discover}} the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} starfish are gonochorous, there being {{separate}} {{male and female}} individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> is apparent when they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs and sperm {{at the same time}} and in a few of these, the same gonad, called an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are sequential hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like Asterina gibbosa start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as Nepanthia belcheri, a large female can split in half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.|$|E

5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, {{similar to that of the}} gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many C.d.guildayi and Smilodon remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.|$|E
50|$|Hughes's {{study also}} {{revealed}} the four main categories of why partners {{participating in a}} casual relationship did not {{feel the need to}} tell <b>their</b> same <b>sex</b> friends about the relationship. The first category was that the partners did not feel that <b>their</b> same <b>sex</b> friends needed to know this information. The second category consisted of people wanting to keep the casual relationship a secret and didn't want <b>their</b> same <b>sex</b> friends to know. The feeling of embarrassment was the third category. Many students said that they would feel ashamed or didn't want to be judged by <b>their</b> same <b>sex</b> friends. The final category is students who didn't want to tell <b>their</b> same <b>sex</b> friends because they would show disapproval of the relationship.|$|R
2500|$|Helminths can {{be either}} hermaphrodites (i.e. can have both sexes), like {{tapeworms}} and the flukes (except the blood fluke {{which is not a}} hermaphrodite), or have <b>their</b> <b>sexes</b> differentiated, like the roundworms.|$|R

5|$|The {{town was}} {{destroyed}} and the Hungarians headed for Bacău, which they also burned down; then {{they continued to}} Roman and stayed there between 29 November and 7 December. According to a chronicle, Stephen sent envoys to negotiate a peace treaty, but the two factions could not agree and the war continued. Roman was put to flames and the Hungarians killed everyone they encountered, “without considering <b>their</b> <b>sex,</b> age, or looks.” After three days of marching and more pillaging, they reached Baia where Corvinus met with a Hungarian {{by the name of}} Sythotus, who revealed to him the Moldavian position, their numbers (12,000), and their plan to attack before dusk. The Moldavians were encamped further north, between Moldova River and Șomuz creek. Corvinus ordered the city to be fortified with “ramparts, ditches and a ring of wagons,” as the men were told to be prepared for battle and guards were sent to guard strategic points.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E

2500|$|Transsexual people {{experience}} a gender identity that is inconsistent with, or not culturally associated with, <b>their</b> assigned <b>sex,</b> {{and desire to}} permanently transition to the gender with which they identify, usually seeking medical assistance (including hormone replacement therapy and other sex reassignment therapies) to help them align their body with <b>their</b> identified <b>sex</b> or gender.|$|R

25|$|In C. lectularius, males {{sometimes}} mount other males because male {{sexual interest}} {{is directed at}} any recently fed individual regardless of <b>their</b> <b>sex,</b> but unfed females may also be mounted. Traumatic insemination {{is the only way}} for copulation to occur in bed bugs. Females have evolved the spermalege to protect themselves from wounding and infection. Because males lack this organ, traumatic insemination could leave them badly injured. For this reason, males have evolved alarm pheromones to signal <b>their</b> <b>sex</b> to other males. If a male C. lectularius mounts another male, the mounted male releases the pheromone signal and the male on top stops before insemination.|$|E
