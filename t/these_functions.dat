5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. <b>These</b> <b>functions</b> of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope.

5|$|The {{dominance}} of the emperor {{was based on the}} consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society.

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed.

For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
