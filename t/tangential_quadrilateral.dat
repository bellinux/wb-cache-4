25|$|Examples of <b>{{tangential}}</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> are the kites, {{which include}} the rhombi, which in turn include the squares. The kites are exactly the <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> that are also orthodiagonal. A right kite is a kite with a circumcircle. If a <b>quadrilateral</b> is both <b>tangential</b> and cyclic, it is called a bicentric quadrilateral, {{and if it is}} both tangential and a trapezoid, it is called a tangential trapezoid.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of the side-angle duality of polygons we compare {{properties}} of the cyclic and <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals.</b>|$|R
25|$|If a line cuts a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> {{into two}} polygons with equal areas and equal perimeters, then that line {{passes through the}} incenter.|$|E
25|$|The eight tangent {{lengths of}} a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> are the line {{segments}} from a vertex to the points where the incircle is tangent to the sides. From each vertex {{there are two}} congruent tangent lengths.|$|E
25|$|The two {{tangency}} chords of a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> are {{the line}} segments that connect points {{on opposite sides}} where the incircle is tangent to these sides. These are also the diagonals of the contact quadrilateral.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometry}} of the cyclic quadrangle in the isotropic plane has been discussed in [11]. Therein, its diagonal triangle and diagonal points were introduced. Hereby, we turn our attention to parabolas inscribed to non <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> of the cyclic quadrangle. Non <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> of the cyclic quadrangle are formed by taking its four sides out of six. Several properties of these parabolas related to diagonal points of the cyclic quadrangle are studied...|$|R
50|$|These {{equations}} {{are closely}} related to the Pitot theorem for <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals,</b> where the sums of opposite sides are equal for the two pairs of opposite sides.|$|R
50|$|All triangles are {{tangential}}, as are all regular polygons {{with any}} number of sides. A well-studied group of tangential polygons are the <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals,</b> which include the rhombi and kites.|$|R
25|$|If the {{extensions}} of opposite sides in a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> intersect at J and K, and the diagonals intersect at P, then JK is {{perpendicular to the}} extension of IP where I is the incenter.|$|E
25|$|A {{tangential}} polygon, {{such as a}} <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral,</b> is any convex polygon {{within which}} a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to {{each side of the}} polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> ABCD with {{incenter}} I {{and where}} the diagonals intersect at P, let HX, HY, HZ, HW be the orthocenters of triangles AIB, BIC, CID, DIA. Then the points P, HX, HY, HZ, HW are collinear.|$|E
25|$|In the nonoverlapping triangles APB, BPC, CPD, DPA {{formed by}} the diagonals in a convex {{quadrilateral}} ABCD, where the diagonals intersect at P, there are the following characterizations of <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A convex {{quadrilateral}} ABCD with sides a, b, c, d is bicentric if {{and only}} if opposite sides satisfy Pitot's theorem for <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> and the cyclic quadrilateral property that opposite angles are supplementary; that is, ...|$|R
50|$|Some (but not all) quadrilaterals have an incircle. These {{are called}} <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals.</b> Among their many {{properties}} {{perhaps the most}} important is that their two pairs of opposite sides have equal sums. This is called the Pitot theorem.|$|R
25|$|In a <b>tangential</b> <b>{{quadrilateral}},</b> {{the four}} angle bisectors {{meet at the}} center of the incircle. Conversely, a convex quadrilateral in which the four angle bisectors meet at a point must be tangential and the common point is the incenter.|$|E
25|$|If the {{extensions}} of opposite sides in a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> intersect at J and K, and the {{extensions of}} opposite sides in its contact quadrilateral intersect at L and M, then the four points J, L, K and M are collinear.|$|E
25|$|The {{tangency}} chord {{between the}} sides AB and CD in a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> ABCD {{is longer than}} the one between the sides BC and DA {{if and only if}} the bimedian between the sides AB and CD is shorter than the one between the sides BC and DA.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{triangle}} area formulas involving the semiperimeter also applies to <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals,</b> which have an incircle and in which pairs of opposite sides have lengths summing to the semiperimeter - namely, the area {{is the product of}} the inradius and the semiperimeter: ...|$|R
50|$|A few metric {{characterizations}} of <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> and orthodiagonal quadrilaterals {{are very similar}} in appearance, {{as can be seen}} in this table. The notations on the sides a, b, c, d, the circumradii R1, R2, R3, R4, and the altitudes h1, h2, h3, h4 are the same as above in both types of quadrilaterals.|$|R
50|$|A few of {{the metric}} {{characterizations}} of <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> (the left column in the table) have very similar counterparts for ex-tangential quadrilaterals (the middle and right column in the table), {{as can be seen}} in the table below. Thus a convex quadrilateral has an incircle or an excircle outside the appropriate vertex (depending on the column) if and only if any one of the five necessary and sufficient conditions below is satisfied.|$|R
25|$|The two diagonals {{and the two}} {{tangency}} chords are concurrent. One way to {{see this}} is as a limiting case of Brianchon's theorem, which states that a hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a single conic section has three diagonals that meet at a point. From a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral,</b> one can form a hexagon with two 180Â° angles, by placing two new vertices at two opposite points of tangency; all six of the sides of this hexagon lie on lines tangent to the inscribed circle, so its diagonals meet at a point. But two of these diagonals {{are the same as}} the diagonals of the <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral,</b> and the third diagonal of the hexagon is the line through two opposite points of tangency. Repeating this same argument with the other two points of tangency completes the proof of the result.|$|E
25|$|If M1 and M2 are the {{midpoints}} of the diagonals AC and BD respectively in a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> ABCD with incenter I, and if {{the pairs}} of opposite sides meet at J and K with M3 being the midpoint of JK, then the points M3, M1, I, and M2 are collinear. The line containing them is the Newton line of the quadrilateral.|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, a <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> (sometimes just tangent quadrilateral) or {{circumscribed}} quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral whose {{sides are}} all tangent {{to a single}} circle within the quadrilateral. This circle is called the incircle of the quadrilateral or its inscribed circle, its center is the incenter and its radius is called the inradius. Since these quadrilaterals can be drawn surrounding or circumscribing their incircles, they have also been called circumscribable quadrilaterals, circumscribing quadrilaterals, and circumscriptible quadrilaterals. Tangential quadrilaterals are a special case of tangential polygons.|$|E
50|$|In Euclidean geometry, a bicentric {{quadrilateral}} is a convex quadrilateral {{that has}} both an incircle and a circumcircle. The radii and center of these circles {{are called the}} inradius and circumradius, and incenter and circumcenter respectively. From the definition it follows that bicentric quadrilaterals have all the properties of both <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> and cyclic quadrilaterals. Other names for these quadrilaterals are chord-tangent quadrilateral and inscribed and circumscribed quadrilateral. It has also been called a double circle quadrilateral.|$|R
50|$|Newton's theorem {{can easily}} be derived from Anne's theorem {{considering}} that in <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> the combined lengths of opposite sides are equal (Pitot theorem: a + c = b + d). Now according to Anne's theorem showing that the combined areas of opposite triangles PAD and PBC and the combined areas of triangles PAB and PCD are equal is sufficient to ensure that P lies on EF. Let r be the radius of the incircle, then r is also the altitude of all four triangles.|$|R
50|$|A kite is an orthodiagonal {{quadrilateral}} {{in which}} one diagonal is a line of symmetry. The kites are exactly the orthodiagonal quadrilaterals that contain a circle tangent to all four of their sides; that is, the kites are the <b>tangential</b> orthodiagonal <b>quadrilaterals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Since eg = fh if {{and only}} if the <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> is also cyclic and hence bicentric, this shows that the maximal area [...] occurs if {{and only if}} the <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> is bicentric.|$|E

2500|$|... with {{equality}} if {{and only}} if the <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> is a square.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Vaynshtejn was {{probably}} the first to prove another beautiful characterization of <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals,</b> that has later appeared in several magazines and websites. It states that when a convex quadrilateral is divided into four nonoverlapping triangles by its two diagonals, then the incenters of the four triangles are concyclic {{if and only if}} the <b>quadrilateral</b> is <b>tangential.</b> In fact, the incenters form an orthodiagonal cyclic quadrilateral. A related result is that the incircles can be exchanged for the excircles to the same triangles (tangent to the sides of the quadrilateral and the extensions of its diagonals). Thus a convex <b>quadrilateral</b> is <b>tangential</b> if and only if the excenters in these four excircles are the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral.|$|R
2500|$|A {{circle that}} is tangent to {{two sides of}} a triangle, as the Malfatti circles are, must be {{centered}} {{on one of the}} angle bisectors of the triangle (green in the figure). These bisectors partition the triangle into three smaller triangles, and Steiner's construction of the Malfatti circles begins by drawing a different triple of circles (shown dashed in the figure) inscribed within each of these three smaller triangles. Each pair of two of these three inscribed circles has two bitangents, lines that touch both of the dashed circles and pass between them: one bitangent is the angle bisector, and the second bitangent is shown as the red dashed line in the figure. Label the three sides of the given triangle as , , and , and label the three bitangents that are not angle bisectors as , , and , where [...] is the bitangent to the two circles that do not touch side , [...] is the bitangent to the two circles that do not touch side , and [...] is the bitangent to the two circles that do not touch side [...] Then the three Malfatti circles are the inscribed circles to the three <b>tangential</b> <b>quadrilaterals</b> , , and [...] The three bitangents , , and [...] cross the triangle sides at the point of tangency with the third inscribed circle, and may also be found as the reflections of the angle bisectors across the lines connecting pairs of centers of these incircles.|$|R
