5|$|According to Upadhyaye, the Bhagvatisūtra (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) {{mentions}} {{three primary}} predications of the saptibhaṅgīnaya. This <b>too</b> <b>is</b> a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.|$|E
5|$|God must be good, Paley argues, {{because in}} many cases the designs seen in nature are beneficial, and because animals {{perceive}} pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain <b>too</b> <b>is</b> mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of gout which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, <b>too,</b> <b>is</b> necessary in the world.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship <b>too</b> <b>is</b> hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Isaac, {{along with}} Ishmael, is highly {{important}} for Muslims for continuing to preach {{the message of}} monotheism after his father Abraham. Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch Jacob, who <b>too</b> <b>is</b> venerated an Islamic prophet.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, {{wrote an}} {{autobiography}} that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it <b>too</b> <b>is</b> lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus, who conspired against him. The inheritance of Nero, Agrippina's {{son and the}} future emperor, was seized by Caligula. Gaetulicus, a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they too are lost.|$|E

Good God! {{how can you have}} so utterly misunderstood me? Compose yourself--pray, compose yourself.' ...|$|R
5|$|Historical {{treatment}} of David I and the Scottish church usually emphasises David's pioneering {{role as the}} instrument of diocesan reorganisation and Norman penetration, beginning with the bishopric of Glasgow while David was Prince of the Cumbrians, and continuing further north after David acceded to the throne of Scotland. Focus <b>too</b> <b>is</b> usually given to {{his role as the}} defender of the Scottish church's independence from claims of overlordship by the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Hollander {{tries to}} get to Cloud, but is killed by Zack. Zack then finds Director Lazard who, now mutated into an Angeal clone, has turned against Shinra. Lazard directs Zack to the remains of Banora to find Genesis. Zack defeats Genesis, but upon {{returning}} he discovers that Shinra have located them, and killed Lazard. The Angeal clone that was left guarding Aerith also arrives, but he <b>too</b> <b>is</b> killed. Zack discovers a note he had carried from Aerith, and learns he and Cloud had been subjected to Hojo's experiments for four years. Zack and Cloud are able to escape, heading towards Midgar, whilst Genesis' body is collected by two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it <b>too</b> <b>is</b> a relic of slavery.|$|E

However, they discover the reset button and attempt to enter the code. As they reach it, Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them, but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus. Cerberus helps Kip and Medly, having learned that he <b>too</b> <b>is</b> a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe {{that he had a}} life outside Planet B. The code is activated and the button is pressed, resetting the whole of Planet B.|$|E
5|$|Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, Bolívar was an {{absolute}} dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, <b>too,</b> <b>is</b> identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude and Santiago Nasar in Chronicle of a Death Foretold.|$|E

A portion of the proceeds from the album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Critical reception of the compilation, which failed to chart in any nation, was mixed.|$|E

Released October 16, 1998, {{it is their}} only album release before disbanding in 1999.

Parker's adaptation includes the dunning solicitor Mr. Gribsby who pursues Jack to Hertfordshire (present in Wilde's original draft, but cut {{at the behest of}} the play's first producer). Algernon <b>too</b> <b>is</b> pursued by a group of creditors in the opening scene.|$|E

Lomax attempts to alert his superiors, but when he meets the Commissioner of Police, he notices that he, <b>too,</b> <b>is</b> sporting the V-shaped mark; the aliens have taken control of the government.|$|E
5|$|Steve Burdick {{is a local}} {{television}} news anchor who keeps his homosexuality private. He and his lover are tested for HIV and both test positive. Burdick struggles to keep himself together as his lover's health declines. When his lover dies, Burdick breaks down {{on the air and}} announces the death and that he <b>too</b> <b>is</b> HIV-positive.

Burdick's pieces are tagged with a viewer discretion advisory. He continues to report until he begins to show symptoms of AIDS, at which time the station managers pull him off the air.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a gada (mace) on side, and someone {{standing next to him}} of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue <b>too</b> <b>is</b> wearing a dhoti.|$|E
