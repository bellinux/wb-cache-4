5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>as</b> she did not harm anyone and was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|Abrikosov {{distinguishes between}} {{ordinary}} metals, and transition metals where the inner shells are not filled. The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies {{than those of}} the transition metals. Gray identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, nihonium, tin, lead, flerovium, bismuth, moscovium, and livermorium. He adds that, 'in reality most of the metals that people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.|$|E
25|$|At {{absolute}} zero temperature, {{a crystal lattice}} lies in its ground state, and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero temperature has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates randomly about some mean value. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which {{can be viewed as}} a gas of phonons. (The random motion of the atoms in the lattice is what we usually <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> heat.) Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.|$|E

500|$|One biographer of Cosby, Linda Etkin, said, [...] "Cosby {{comes across}} as a father figure, a teacher, and a friend" [...] in his advertisements. William Turner, in 1982 the {{marketing}} manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said Cosby [...] "represents comfort, and people trust him". In 2014, one educator asked for comment said he remembered Cosby as a [...] "black male authority figure, {{one of those people who}} folks that don't live on the edges of the country <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a good black guy; they trust that guy".|$|E
500|$|Halo 4 audio {{director}} Sotaro Tojima {{began looking}} for the game's composer in 2010. [...] "I had {{a vision for the}} overall Halo 4 music production that I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> 'Digital and Organic'," [...] he wrote—"something very much inspired by the game script." [...] This vision led him to explore electronica and dance music to find his chosen sound. Tojima decided on Davidge after a year's search. 343 Industries officially named Davidge as Halo 4s main composer on April 11, 2012; by that point the name of Halo 4s composer had been kept a secret for fifteen months.|$|E
500|$|We {{all know}} that steel making has been {{important}} to south Wales, just as slate making has changed {{the landscape of the}} north. We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>as</b> she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E
500|$|Weber {{was also}} {{influenced}} by Kantian ethics, which he nonetheless came to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties. In this last respect, the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy is evident. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the [...] "deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview". Another major influence in Weber's life was the writings of Karl Marx and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics. While Weber shares some of Marx's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic {{to the detriment of}} human freedom and autonomy, Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia. Though the influence of his mother's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work, and though he maintained a deep, lifelong interest in the study of religions, Weber was open {{about the fact that he}} was personally irreligious.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as,</b> you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
