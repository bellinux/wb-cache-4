5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>all</b> of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E

500|$|Mortimer {{was willing}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>all,</b> as Forbes {{had had an}} affair with his wife (which also broke up the Forbes marriage). The {{construction}} executive was the star witness at the hearings in late 1923, after Harding's death. Forbes returned from Europe to testify, but convinced few, and in 1924, he and John W. Thompson, of Thompson–Black, were tried in Chicago for conspiracy to defraud the government. Both were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Forbes began to serve his sentence in 1926; Thompson, who had a bad heart, died that year before commencing his. According to Trani and Wilson, [...] "One of the most troublesome aspects of the Harding presidency was that he appeared to be far more concerned with political liabilities of a scandal than in securing justice." ...|$|E

2500|$|An Australian criminologist, Gordon Hawkins, the {{director}} of Sydney University's Institute of Criminology, doubts the damning validity of the [...] "unsigned confessions" [...] of Ryan in a television film documentary, Beyond reasonable doubt.

As to whether as a result an innocent man was hanged, {{there is at least}} a reasonable doubt. Following revelations of police corruption uncovered by various Australian police royal commissions.
