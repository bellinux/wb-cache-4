5|$|The {{number of}} trees in the world, {{according}} to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 <b>trillion,</b> of which 1.39 <b>trillion</b> (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 <b>trillion</b> (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 <b>trillion</b> (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, {{and is based on}} tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.|$|E
