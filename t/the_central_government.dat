On 19 August, associations of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) met with the Secretary of Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) S K Sarkar and demanded that <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> should modify the rules related to suspension of bureaucrats by state governments, as those rules were widely abused. The three associations want <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> instead of various state governments to {{have the authority to}} suspend any All India Services officer.|$|E
5|$|When South Kasai seceded, {{government}} {{troops from the}} Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC) were already fighting Katangese troops in the Kasai region. South Kasai held important railway junctions needed by the Congolese army for its campaign in Katanga, and therefore soon became an important objective. South Kasai also had important mineral wealth which <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> was anxious {{to return to the}} Congo. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> also misunderstood the South Kasaian position, believing that, like Katanga, the region had declared full independence from the Congo and rejected Congolese sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|After Indonesia proclaimed its {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, {{the entirety of}} Sumatra was declared a de facto part of the country. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> established Teuku Muhammad Hasan as the island's first governor, and on 29 October 1945 Hasan selected Amir as the government representative in Langkat (later equated to regent), with his office at Binjai. Amir accepted the position readily, subsequently handling numerous tasks set by <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government,</b> including inaugurating the first local division of the People's Safety Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakjat; the predecessor to the Indonesian Army) opening meetings of various local branches of national political parties, and promoting education– particularly Latin-alphabet literacy.|$|E

5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, which means that <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities {{a certain degree of}} independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E
5|$|Chang'an was {{the center}} of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government,</b> the home of the {{imperial}} family, and was filled with splendor and wealth.

5|$|Since commandery-issued coins {{were often}} of {{inferior}} quality and lighter weight, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> closed commandery mints and monopolized {{the issue of}} coinage in 113 BC.

5|$|Song scholar-officials {{were granted}} ranks, honors, and career {{appointments}} {{on the basis}} of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty. The anonymity of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case for removal was always carefully examined, since <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese {{belief in}} the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also {{challenged}} when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest shook {{the foundations of the}} empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714–719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.|$|E

50|$|Actually, from 320s on, the Cuan (爨) (Cuàn) family {{began to}} control Yunnan.

The Cuan family took the strategy {{by which they}} recognized the nominal sovereignty of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>governments</b> while remaining themselves as the real local rulers.

When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey doesn't have a federal system, and the provinces are subordinate to <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (vali) and town governors (kaymakam). Other senior public officials are also appointed by <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>government</b> instead of the mayors (belediye başkanı) or elected by constituents. Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (belediye meclisi) for decision-making on municipal issues.|$|E

The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and {{expected}} to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture.
