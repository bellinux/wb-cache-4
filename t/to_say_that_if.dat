5|$|The {{command of}} the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still {{holding on to the}} Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's Army Group Centre {{launched}} a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained {{that he did not have}} the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ and Thiệu were {{reluctant}} to campaign and meet the populace as they saw such events as liabilities rather than opportunities {{to win over the}} public, and showed little interest in gaining popular support in any case, as they could always count on a rigging of the ballot. The CIA reported that the pair had no intention of participating on the arranged rallies with the civilian candidates because they felt that “possible heckling from the audience that would be too humiliating.” Thiệu and Kỳ were correct; they made one public campaign appearance at a rally, where a very disapproving crowd in Huế assailed Kỳ as a “hooligan” and “cowboy leader.” Kỳ and Thiệu decided to campaign indirectly by appearing at set piece ceremonial appointments, such as transferring land titles to peasants, as hostile elements from the general population {{were less likely to be}} present. Thiệu took a restrained and more moderate stance during the campaign toward the issue of demoncracy, while Kỳ, the public face of the ticket and the incumbent government, went on the attack, damaging the pair’s image and supposed commitment to democracy. Kỳ did not hide his distaste for democracy or his opponents and “described the civilian candidates as 'ordure' , 'traitors,' and 'destroyers of the national interest.'” He continued on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> his opponents continued to attack him, he would cancel the poll. In the accompanying senate election, Kỳ openly endorsed 11 slates, but only one was successful in gaining one of the six seats.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to {{introduce}} fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, a novel method for social research that has been developed by Charles Ragin. The method {{has been used in}} my article “Explaining Government Preferences for Institutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy”. 1 At the basis of the method is the insight that patterns of causal necessity and sufficiency can be expressed in set-theoretic terms. For instance, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a having market economy is a necessary condition for a country to be democratic is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> a country is not in the set of countries with a market economy, then it will not be in the set of democratic countries. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> being a democratic state is a sufficient condition for never being at war with another democratic state is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> a state is in the set of democratic states, then it will be in the set of states that are never at war with democratic states. This reasoning applies not only to single causes but also to combinations of causes, and this is especially important because many social-scientific theories consist of statements about the impact of combinations of causes. Consider for instance the thesis that sharing a democrati...|$|R

500|$|While the {{majority}} of the staff were pleased with [...] "Tapestry", Piller felt that the premise was tired and was concerned that it was simply a take on the film It's a Wonderful Life. He said that some scenes were [...] "very talky", and the direction and some performances were [...] "flat". Moore participated in an AOL chat in 1997, where he described [...] "Tapestry" [...] as [...] "one of the best things I wrote and one of TNGs finest episodes". Some fans wrote in to the staff to complain that the episode glorified violence, and was against the principles of Star Trek. Jeri Taylor admitted that the episode could be seen as violent, but it never crossed the mind of any of the staff during production. She went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they had realized that [...] "Tapestry" [...] could be considered to promote violence, then they would have corrected it to ensure that it wouldn't be viewed as such.|$|E
500|$|... "It seems fair <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the {{influence}} of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived," [...] wrote Miklós Rédei in John von Neumann: Selected Letters. James Glimm wrote: [...] "he is {{regarded as one of the}} giants of modern mathematics". The mathematician Jean Dieudonné said that von Neumann [...] "may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group, the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions", while Peter Lax described him as possessing the [...] "most scintillating intellect of this century". In the foreword of Miklós Rédei's Selected Letters, Peter Lax wrote, [...] "To gain a measure of von Neumann's achievements, consider that had he lived a normal span of years, he would certainly have been a recipient of a Nobel Prize in economics. And if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too. So the writer of these letters should be thought of as a triple Noble laureate or, possibly, a -fold winner, for his work in physics, in particular, quantum mechanics".|$|E

Sample also wrote that although he suspected that Ana-Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com wrote that the episode contained the [...] "Biggest ... twist ... ever." [...] Slocum went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you {{had not seen the}} episode, [...] "whoooeee [...] are you in for a treat", and called the two murders [...] "a doozy".

500|$|The {{recurring}} theme of published tests was the Tagora´s lack of clear advantages or of a competitive edge. In comparing {{the car to}} its likely competitors, Autocars verdict was that [...] "the new Talbot is highly comparable with the others, and deserves to sell as any of them, although it does not come out with any startling advantages which you might expect of the latest appearance on the scene". Those cars against which the Tagora 2.2 GLS was compared were the Ford Granada 2.3 GL, Opel Rekord 2.0S, Renault 20TX, Rover 2300 and Volvo 244 GL. Of these cars, the Tagora was the second most expensive but {{did not have a}} superiority among the significant attributes of speed, acceleration, interior room or chassis design. Out of the comparison group the Tagora had the second highest top speed, was the third fastest to 60mph though it had the best overall mpg (by 0.7 mpg). In terms of interior room, it had the fourth best legroom (front/rear). Motor Sport also noted the car´s modest competence in comparison with the Rover 2300 (launched 1976), saying that the Tagora had more leisurely acceleration. LJK Setright noted the cars´s overall [...] "adequacy" [...] going on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> fitted with the correct type of tyre he would still opt for a Peugeot 604 instead. Car judged the chassis design to be one area [...] "where [...] does not show the comparative youth of its design".|$|E
500|$|As {{the speech}} was being aired, two {{infantry}} divisions and supporting loyal armour approached the palace grounds. Some of these had broken through the rebel encirclement by falsely claiming to be anti-Diệm reinforcements, before setting up their positions next to the palace.

If a bloodbath is not avoided, all of Vietnam will go communist in a very short time." [...] Durbrow deplored the attempt to resolve the situation with force. Diệm blamed the rebels for causing the outbreak of fighting and the collapse of the power-sharing deal. Some of the Saigon-based units that had joined the rebellion sensed that Diệm had regained the upper hand and switched sides {{for the second time in}} two days. The paratroopers became outnumbered and were forced to retreat to defensive positions around their barracks, which was an ad hoc camp that had been set up in a public park approximately [...] away. After a brief but violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. This included a large number of civilians, who had been engaging in anti-Diệm protests outside the palace grounds. Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngos by charging the palace, and 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers from the 2nd Armored Battalion as they invaded the grounds.
