5|$|Infinity Blade is a {{fighting}} game with role-playing elements developed by Chair Entertainment and Epic Games and released through the Apple App Store on December 9, 2010. It {{is the first}} iOS video game to run on the Unreal Engine. In the game, the unnamed player character fights a series of one-on-one battles in a derelict castle to face the immortal God King. When in battle, players swipe <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> attack and parry, and tap <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> dodge and block enemy attacks. Upon victory or defeat, the player restarts the game as the character's descendant with the same items and experience level.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman. The player-character {{automatically}} {{moves to the}} right of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> jump and perform tricks, and works towards goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E
5|$|Space Race is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released on July 16, 1973. It {{was the second}} game by the company after Pong (1972), which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry. In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> the top. Along the way are asteroids, which the players must avoid. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles.|$|E

50|$|A back {{screen is}} a {{basketball}} maneuver involving two players, called a cutter and a <b>screener.</b> <b>The</b> <b>screener</b> remains stationary {{on the court}} while the cutter moves toward the basket and attempts <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> <b>to</b> separate himself from his defender.|$|R
5|$|The player {{controls}} {{a yellow}} knight riding a flying ostrich or stork, from a third-person perspective. Using the two-way directional joystick and the button for flapping the ostrich's wings, the player flies the knight amidst the floating rock platforms and above pools of lava; when maneuvering off <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> either side, the player will continue its path reappearing {{from the opposite}} side. The {{rate at which the}} player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{animated}} in a stylized way, which Tartakovsky says {{was influenced by}} the Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat and close to <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>to</b> leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
50|$|Dive Bomber has {{digitized}} sound. The player uses a mouse on the Atari ST and Amiga versions to make menu selections and fly the plane. The game employs several <b>screens.</b> <b>The</b> player uses <b>the</b> Pilot’s <b>Screen</b> <b>to</b> fly <b>the</b> plane, {{with such}} controls as the brake, vertical speed, artificial horizon, and torpedo release. The player uses <b>the</b> Engineer’s <b>Screen</b> <b>to</b> select fuel tanks {{and to set}} the fuel mixture and throttle. The player uses <b>the</b> Navigator’s <b>Screen</b> <b>to</b> view {{a map of the}} surrounding area and the locations of enemy aircraft and ships. The player uses <b>the</b> Tail Gunner’s <b>Screen</b> <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> enemy aircraft attacking from the rear, where they can be machine-gunned. Tips for flying the Avenger {{can be found in the}} player’s manual.|$|R

5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Blek is a 2013 puzzle {{video game}} for iOS and Android by Kunabi Brother, {{a team of}} {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. The player draws a snakelike black line that recurs in pattern and velocity across <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> remove colored dots and avoid black dots. It is minimalist in design, features excerpts of Erin Gee, and takes inspiration from Golan Levin, the Bauhaus, and Japanese calligraphy. The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.|$|E

5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles. Episode One integrates tutorial-like tasks into the story to familiarize the player with new gameplay mechanics without breaking immersion. A head-up display appears on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> display the character's health, energy, and ammunition. Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons and ammunition that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial weapon is the crowbar, Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} game by allowing the player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E

50|$|At <b>the</b> FreedomFilmFest <b>screening</b> in George Town, Penang, 15 {{officers}} from Malaysia's Ministry of Home Affairs turned up {{to stop the}} show, claiming that the film had not been vetted {{and approved by the}} film censor board. However, after half an hour of discussions with the organisers, the officers allowed <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>to</b> proceed.|$|R
5|$|Space Invaders {{was first}} {{released}} in a cocktail-table format {{with black and}} white graphics, while the Western release by Midway was in an upright cabinet format. The upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane, such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978, followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.|$|E
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E
5|$|The player touches <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> move Adam Jensen, a protagonist {{from the}} stealth combat, cyber-dystopian Deus Ex series, between nodes on a {{hexagonal}} grid towards an exit. If {{moved to a}} specific node, the character will stealthily take down guards, hack computers, and activate his human augmentations, such as invisibility. Enemies who spot Jensen will move towards and, if they reach his node, eliminate him. Alternatively, Jensen can eliminate enemies if approached from behind or their side. In the game's story, which is set before the events of , Jensen's sole mission is to save an important person, but is continually set back by puzzles—54 in total.|$|E

5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

5|$|Underwurlde is a {{platform}} game viewed from a side-angle perspective. The player controls Sabreman, a pith-helmeted adventurer, as he jumps between platforms in a castle and its underground caverns {{to find a}} way to escape past the exit guardians. Sabreman must use a specific weapon—knife, dagger, and torch—that corresponds to each guardian. The player uses the keyboard's QWERT keys to progress through a series of flip screens in which the player's character reaches the boundary of the viewable area on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>to</b> flip to another area, with 597 screens in all. While Sabreman begins in a castle adorned with clocks, birds, and baskets, the character must also descend down into caverns through several successive vertical screens. Sabreman automatically attaches a rope to the ceiling when the player controls him off of a ledge. The player can then swing Sabreman side to side to jump to another ledge. At the bottom of a cavern, Sabreman can ride a bubble to the top.|$|E
