5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} was {{notable for}} showing {{a wide range}} of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Suprunyuk and Sayenko are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked {{to take part in the}} documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.|$|E

The team, formed {{in the wake of}} the [...] "Inhumans vs X-Men" [...] storyline, also includes Quake, Karnak, Moon Girl, and Devil Dinosaur. Rosenberg stated that there is some conflict and friction amongst the team members explaining, [...] "Ms. Marvel and Quake are really fighting for the soul of the team in a lot of ways, while Moon Girl will continue to really do her own thing.

500|$|The final debate {{took place}} October 28 at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, to an {{overflow}} crowd {{in excess of}} a thousand. Voorhis went on the attack, charging Nixon with misrepresenting the [...] "46votes" [...] to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues. The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for [...] "the person on a pension {{trying to keep up}} with the rising cost of living... the white-collar worker who has not had a raise... Americans have had enough, and they have come to the conclusion that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something." [...] Nixon sat down to thunderous applause, and the San Gabriel Sun described Voorhis: [...] "He pauses, breathes heavily, scans the audience with tired eyes, adjusts his glasses nervously with both hands, and then strikes the podium with an open hand." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the phrase}} as a {{reference}} to demagoguery and hypocrisy is traced to a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man. After receiving criticism of his country beca{{use of the}} deaths caused by the 1905 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Ambassador to the United States pointed out [...] "Americans had recently lynched blacks". The Russian Ambassador said locals engaged in violence when drunk, [...] "just like Americans." [...] Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama. The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the U.S. {{as a form of}} criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?, Sherwood Eddy wrote: [...] "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting on {{not just}} the {{situation}} in Tunisia and Egypt {{but also on the}} 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, [...] "The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable." [...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform." [...] At the same time, she said that the U.S. [...] "cannot tell countries what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] cannot dictate the outcomes." [...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so." ...|$|E
