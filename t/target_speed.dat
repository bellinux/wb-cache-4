25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth audio frequency induction loops between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The {{system is}} able to fire on the move using 30mm cannons, {{although}} it must be stationary to fire missiles, the maximum <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> can be up to 500m/s, reaction time 6–8 seconds. Each 2S6 has all facilities for independent warfare.|$|E
25|$|The LZB system treats a red signal or the {{beginning}} of a block containing a train as a speed restriction of 0 speed. The driver will see the same sequence as approaching a speed restriction except the <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> is 0.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a long {{distance}} free in front of the train the driver will see the <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> and permitted speed equal to the maximum line speed, with the distance showing the maximum distance, between 4km and 13.2km depending on the unit, train, and line.|$|E
50|$|To aim the guns, base data {{such as the}} <b>target's</b> <b>speed,</b> {{direction}} and range must be entered into the sighting system by the sight adjuster, who sits {{to the left of}} the guns at the rear of the turret. The <b>target's</b> <b>speed</b> and direction is determined by visual estimation, while range can also be estimated visually or with the rangefinder. The upper front of the turret has two small ports with armoured covers meant for collimators of the sight.|$|R

25|$|Denmark's {{two biggest}} cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, are about 300km apart, {{and there is}} a {{political}} target to reach a two-hour traveling time, and 200km/h is set as a <b>target</b> <b>speed.</b> Some parts are planned to be rerouted because the present railway is curvy there and {{they are likely to be}} designed for higher than 200km/h.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{teaching}} method is the Koch method, named after German psychologist Ludwig Koch, which uses the full <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> {{from the outset}} but begins with just two characters. Once strings containing those two characters can be copied with 90% accuracy, an additional character is added, and so on until the full character set is mastered.|$|E
25|$|Straight running torpedoes {{were usually}} {{launched}} in salvo (i.e. multiple launches {{in a short}} period of time) or a spread (i.e. multiple launches with slight angle offsets) to increase the probability of striking the target given the inaccuracies present in the measurement of angles, target range, <b>target</b> <b>speed,</b> torpedo track angle, and torpedo speed.|$|E
50|$|SCRIM has a daily survey {{capacity}} of 200 to 300 km depending upon road type. A SCRIM survey in the UK can be undertaken at two different <b>target</b> test <b>speeds</b> of 50 and 80 km/h. The permitted speed range covering these <b>target</b> <b>speeds</b> is 25 to 85 km/h. Skidding resistance data recorded at speeds within this range can be speed corrected to give equivalent values at 50 km/h.|$|R

50|$|Christiansen's {{efforts were}} filmed by TV NZ for a {{documentary}} programme which captured the emotional {{highs and lows}} of his Speedweek venture. He did not achieve this <b>targeted</b> <b>speed</b> of 200 mi/h km/h, instead topped at 182 mph (293 km/h).|$|R
25|$|As {{the train}} {{approaches}} a speed restriction, {{such as one}} for a curve or turnout, LZB will sound a buzzer and display the distance to and speed of the restriction. As the train continues the target distance will decrease. As the train nears the speed restriction the permitted speed will start to decrease, ending up at the <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> at the restriction. At that point the display will change to the next target.|$|E
25|$|The unified multi-functional 9M317 (export {{designation}} 9M317E) {{can be used}} {{to engage}} aerodynamic, ballistic, above-water and radio contrast targets from both land and sea. Examples of targets include tactical ballistic missiles, strategic cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, tactical, strategic and army aircraft and helicopters. It was designed by OJSC Dolgoprudny Scientific Production Plant (DNPP). The maximum engagable <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> was 1200m/s and it can tolerate an acceleration overload of 24G. It was first used with Buk-M1-2 system of the land forces and the Shtil-1 system of the naval forces.|$|E
25|$|At high speed, {{the driver}} cannot see lineside signals reliably. With the TVM {{signalling}} {{used on the}} high-speed lines, the <b>target</b> <b>speed</b> {{for the end of}} the current block is displayed with a flashing indication for the next block if it is a different speed. Auxiliary signalling information, including the location of neutral sections in the overhead supply and pantograph adjustment zones, is displayed in cab and by the lineside. The operation of circuit breakers over neutral sections is handled automatically on TVM-signalled lines only, and pantograph adjustments must always be performed by the driver.|$|E
