50|$|By {{the early}} 2000s <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> {{had begun to}} decline, and in 2004 Takanohana Kenshi retired due to ill health. His son Takanohana Kōji took over, {{renaming}} <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> Takanohana-beya. <b>The</b> <b>stable's</b> last sekitori, Takanonami, retired shortly afterwards. Under Takanohana Kōji's stewardship <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> initially failed to attract many recruits, and retirements {{reduced the number of}} active wrestlers to as low as seven in 2007. Recruitment has since picked up, with seven new wrestlers joining between the March 2008 and May 2009 tournaments. As of May 2012 <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> has thirteen wrestlers, among them a foreigner, Mongolian Takanoiwa, who was recruited in November 2008. In November 2009 he took the championship in the sandanme division, the first yūshō for <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> since it was renamed. Takanoiwa earned promotion to jūryō in May 2012, the first new sekitori at <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> since Gokenzan in March 1995, and reached the top makuuchi division in January 2014, ending a ten-year drought for <b>the</b> <b>stable.</b>|$|R

5|$|By the 1850s, the Angel was {{reported}} to be in decline. The New Road was renamed Pentonville Road in 1857, and the inn's management successfully put shop fronts on the road around 1870, along with extensive refurbishments. In 1880, the Angel was refurbished internally for William Henry and Richard Baker, later to become large-scale pub owners. In 1883 <b>the</b> <b>stables</b> were sold to the London Street Tramways and the main building was sold to the brewers Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co. in 1896.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The real {{homology}} of a compact, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M {{is naturally}} endowed with <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> norm. <b>The</b> <b>stable</b> norm of a homology class is the minimal Riemannian volume of its representatives. If M is orientable <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> norm on Hn− 1 (M,R) is a homogenized {{version of the}} Riemannian (n− 1) -volume. We study the differentiability properties of <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> norm at points α ∈ Hn− 1 (M,R). They depend on the position of α {{with respect to the}} integer lattice Hn− 1 (M,Z) in Hn− 1 (M,R). In particular, we show that <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> norm is differentiable at α if α is totally irrational. 1. Introduction. O...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>stable</b> {{distribution}} {{has been}} shown to more accurately model some aspects of network traffic than alternative distributions. In this work, we quantitatively examine aspects of the modeling performance of <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> distribution as envisioned in a statistical network cyber event detection system. We examine the flexibility and robustness of <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> distribution, extending previous work by comparing the performance of <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> distribution against alternatives using three different, public network traffic data sets with a mix of traffic rates and cyber events. After showing <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> distribution to be the overall most accurate for the examined scenarios, we use the Hellinger metric to investigate the ability of <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> distribution to reduce modeling error when using small data windows and counting periods. For the selected case and metric, <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> model is compared to a Gaussian model and is shown to produce the best overall fit as well as the best (or at worst, equivalent) fit for all counting periods. Additionally, <b>the</b> best <b>stable</b> fit occurs at a counting period that is five times shorter than the best Gaussian case. These results imply that <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> distribution can provide a more robust and accurate model than Gaussian-based alternatives in statistical network anomaly detection implementations while also facilitating faster system detection and response...|$|R
