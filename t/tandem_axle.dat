5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting <b>tandem</b> <b>axle,</b> {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over before the company could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load lifting <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{weight and}} size of CMVs are {{restricted}} for practical and safety reasons. CMVs are restricted by gross weight (total weight of vehicle and cargo), and by axle weight (i.e., the weight carried by each tire). The federal weight limits for CMVs are [...] for gross weight (unless the bridge formula dictates a lower limit), [...] for a <b>tandem</b> <b>axle,</b> and [...] for a single axle. A <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> is defined as two or more consecutive axles whose centers are spaced more than [...] {{but not more than}} [...] apart. Axles spaced less than [...] apart are considered a single axle.|$|E
500|$|There is one {{exception}} to the formula: two consecutive sets of <b>tandem</b> <b>axles</b> may carry [...] each if the overall distance {{between the first and}} last <b>axles</b> of these <b>tandems</b> is [...] or more. For example, a five-axle truck may carry 34,000pounds both on the tractor <b>tandem</b> <b>axles</b> (2 and 3) and the trailer <b>tandem</b> <b>axles</b> (4 and 5), provided axles 2 and 5 are spaced at least [...] apart.|$|R

2500|$|Like all structures, roads {{deteriorate}} over time. Deterioration {{is primarily}} due to accumulated damage from vehicles, however environmental effects such as frost heaves, thermal cracking and oxidation often contribute. [...] According {{to a series of}} experiments carried out in the late 1950s, called the AASHO Road Test, it was empirically determined that the effective damage done to the road is roughly proportional to the Fourth power of axle weight. [...] A typical tractor-trailer weighing 80,000 pounds (36.287 t) with 8,000 pounds (3.629 t) on the steer axle and 36,000 pounds (16.329 t) on both of the <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> groups is expected to do 7,800 times more damage than a passenger vehicle with 2,000 pounds (0.907 t) on each axle. [...] Potholes on roads are caused by rain damage and vehicle braking or related construction works.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> is a {{group of}} two or more axles {{situated}} close together. Truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a single axle. Semi trailers usually have a <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> at the rear.|$|E

5000|$|The cargo trailer {{usually has}} <b>tandem</b> <b>axles</b> at the rear, {{each of which}} has dual wheels, or eight tires on the trailer, four per axle. In the US it is common to refer to the number of wheel hubs, rather than the number of tires; an axle can have either single or dual tires with no legal difference. The {{combination}} of eight tires on the trailer and ten tires on the tractor is what led to the moniker eighteen wheeler, although this term is considered by some truckers to be a misnomer (the term [...] "eighteen-wheeler" [...] is a nickname for a five-axle over-the-road combination). Many trailers are equipped with movable <b>tandem</b> <b>axles</b> to allow adjusting the weight distribution.|$|R

5000|$|The pilot {{episode was}} a made-for-television movie {{originally}} titled In Tandem - {{a reference to}} the <b>tandem</b> <b>axles</b> on the tractor and trailer, as well as that they drove as a team, or [...] "in tandem".

50|$|Models included: 1600, Binder, 1700, 1750, 1800, and 1850, {{with the}} numbers {{indicating}} {{the size of the}} model. The 1750 and 1850 had mid-range diesels. The 1600 and 1700 were available with 4X4, the 1800 and 1850 with <b>tandem</b> rear <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{foremost}} axle on the <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> is powered. When fully loaded, the K-44 carries approximately 62% of {{the weight}} lying on the <b>tandem</b> <b>axle.</b> The rear, non-driven axle, {{is linked to the}} driven axle through a simple sub-assembly consisting of 3.5 in wide and 1500 mm long leaf springs and rocker arms. When the torque delivered to the rear axle is increased, the mechanism automatically shifts vehicle weight away from the non-driven axle to the driven axle, improving traction when most needed. Additionally, more {{of the weight}} can be moved to the driven axle manually using an electro hydraulic system. In order to reduce fuel consumption and tyre wear the non-driven rear axle can also be raised completely off the road/surface, if a third load-bearing axle is not needed because the vehicle is running empty: running on just two axles also reduces the K-44's turning circle.|$|E
50|$|The tank chassis {{has evolved}} {{over the past years}} to {{accommodate}} greater payload weights. The tank chassis comes in <b>tandem</b> <b>axle,</b> spread axle, tri-axle, and hi/lo combo configurations. <b>Tandem</b> <b>Axle</b> Chassis were the industry standard initially. The closed tandem drop deck chassis typically have a GVWR of 65000 lb. The quest to increase payload capacities spawned the tri-axle chassis with the ability to scale 42000 lb. on the trailer axles. The addition of the third axle however added a significant increase to the tare weight of the chassis, thus limiting the permissible weight limits to comply with bridge laws. This led to the invention of the Spread Axle Chassis with a spread of 109 in allowing for the same weight to be dispersed on the rear axles of the trailer (42000 lb) as the tri-axle. This is the new industry standard with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 80000 lb.|$|E
50|$|The 8500 {{model has}} a {{wheelbase}} from 128 to 201 in, {{is powered by}} an International HT 570. Its front axle capacity is 10000 lb or 12000 lb. Rear single axle has a capacity of 23000 lb. Rear <b>tandem</b> <b>axle</b> has a capacity of 40000 lb. Both axles are either Meritor or Dana Spicer and are available with a driver-controlled locking differential. Applications include beverage, city tractor, and regional haul.|$|E
5000|$|Chassis weights were increased, {{front axle}} GAWRs were {{available}} up to 20,000 lb, single rear axles to 23,000 lb as before, and <b>tandem</b> rear <b>axles</b> to 46,000 lb. On tandems a walking beam type was standard and 2 different air suspensions were available.|$|R
