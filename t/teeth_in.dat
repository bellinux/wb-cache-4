5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no <b>teeth.</b> <b>In</b> many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{sperm whales}} differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the {{possible}} exception of Aulophyseter, had <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> their upper jaws. Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern Orca (Killer Whale). Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales.|$|E
5|$|The Delphinidae are {{characterized}} by having distinct beaks (unlike the Phocoenidae), two or more fused cervical vertebrae and 20 or more pairs of <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> their upper jaws. None is more than 4m long.|$|E

5|$|Both Abrictosaurus and Heterodontosaurus {{had very}} large eyes. Underneath the eyes, the jugal bone {{projected}} sideways, a feature {{also present in}} ceratopsians. As in the jaws of most ornithischians, the anterior edge of the premaxilla (a bone {{at the tip of}} the upper jaw) was toothless and probably supported a keratinous beak (rhamphotheca), although heterodontosaurids did have <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> the posterior section of the premaxilla. A large gap, called a diastema, separated these premaxillary teeth from those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw bone) in many ornithischians, but this diastema was characteristically arched in heterodontosaurids. The mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischians. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like <b>teeth.</b> <b>In</b> some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of ectopic <b>teeth</b> has increased. <b>In</b> many cases, {{the etiology of}} ectopic teeth cannot be identified. Ectopic <b>tooth</b> <b>in</b> deciduous dentition period is very rare and information is limited about its causes and characteristics. The conditions commonly {{associated with an increased}} prevalence of ectopic teeth include cleft lip and palate, cleidocranial dysplasia, and Gardner syndrome. The diagnosis is made by the clinical and radiological examinations. The indication for extraction <b>in</b> ectopic <b>teeth</b> cases is <b>in</b> general determined by the presence of symptomatology, or by the need for preventing future complications. We present a case of an ectopic maxillary <b>tooth</b> <b>in</b> a 4 year-old boy. In addition, this report also addresses a young patient with a <b>tooth</b> <b>in</b> the oropharynx with the objective of non traumatic etiology, and such a clinical presentation is extremely rare.

In some cases, the alveolar tooth-bearing bone is also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} durability of the <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E

5|$|The toothcomb, {{a special}} {{morphological}} arrangement of <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> the anterior lower jaw, {{is best known}} in extant strepsirrhine primates, which include lemurs and lorisoid primates (collectively known as lemuriforms). This homologous structure is a diagnostic character that helps define this clade (related group) of primates. An analogous trait {{is found in the}} bald uakari (Cacajao calvus), a type of New World monkey.|$|E
5|$|There are 5 premaxillary <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> both species, {{the fourth}} of {{which is about a}} third larger {{relative}} to the others. The maxilla has 12 distinct sockets in K. langenbergensis. Excluding the pseudocaniniforms, the maxillary tooth size remains roughly constant but gradually decreases after the pseudocaniniforms in both species; all tooth sockets after the twelfth are replaced by a continuous trough. In total, K. guimarotae had at least 15 maxillary teeth, and K. langenbergensis 17 or 18. Meanwhile, the dentary exhibits 21 <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> K. langenbergensis and at least 20 in K. guimarotae. Like the maxilla, distinct sockets for dentary teeth are replaced by a groove from the eleventh tooth backwards in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E

5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom <b>teeth)</b> <b>in</b> which the blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth {{used to be}} empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E
5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.|$|E

5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual <b>teeth.</b> <b>In</b> the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
