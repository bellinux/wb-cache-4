In this study such a characterization is performed in two types of cell-free lysates, one derived from stationary phase cells, grown in rich medium (SR-lysates) and one from exponentially growing cells (log phase), cultured in minimal medium (LM-lysates). Six Phase I enzyme activities of aromatic NADPH hydroxylase, NADH hydroxylase, flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), nitroreductase, DT-diaphorase and NADPH ferredoxin:oxidoreductase were determined. Activities of six Phase II enzymes glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), N-aryl acetyltransferase (NAT), arylamine sulphotransferase, UDP-glucuronyltransferase and epoxide hydratase and of the Phase III enzyme cysteine conjugate β-lyase were subsequently assessed. In addition, five antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione (GSH) -reductase, GSH-peroxidase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; as well as concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and its disulphide (GSSG), were measured. The activity parameters of all enzymes were compared with those obtained in similar lysates of the Salmonella strain TA 100 and in rat liver preparations.

The mutagenicity of the quinones via this pathway {{was found to be}} attributable to the generation of oxygen radicals. The cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenase also {{played a significant role in}} the detoxification and bioactivation of these quinones. For example, phenanthrenequinone was converted to a nonmutagenic metabolite in a cytochrome P- 450 -dependent reaction, whereas danthron was converted to a highly mutagenic metabolite. These studies show the complexity of metabolic pathways involved in the mutagenicity of quinones...|$|R
30|$|The Salmonella (Ames) {{mutagenicity}} assay with metabolic activation {{was used as}} a proxy to measure the carcinogenicity of degradation products (Ames et al. 1975). <b>Tester</b> <b>strain</b> TA 1535 (Molecular Toxicology Inc., Boone, NC) was used because it has a –G–G–G– DNA target and is susceptible to the same base substitutions that AFB 1 induces (Foster et al. 1983). A subset of samples from P. ostreatus-treated and mock inoculated groups originally contaminated at 2500  ng g− 1 AFB 1, in addition to uncontaminated control substrate samples, were used for this assay. A serial dilution of pure AFB 1 in 70 % MeOH ranging from 0 to 10, 000  ng g− 1 {{was used as a}} reference. Controls containing only 70 % MeOH and S- 9 metabolic mix without aflatoxin were also used. Samples from both runs of the degradation experiment were assayed concurrently and compared to a single set of control samples. Three biological and three technical replicates were used for each treatment and control group. Colonies were enumerated using OpenCFU software (Geissmann 2013). Data are given as the number of revertant colony forming units (CFUs).|$|R
