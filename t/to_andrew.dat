He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the club}} were founded in 1883, {{they did not}} appoint a {{full-time}} manager until 1899, when Alfred Homer, who was assistant secretary of Aston Villa, was appointed as manager-secretary of Bristol Rovers, a position he held for twenty-one years. On joining the Football League in 1920, the club appointed Ben Hall to the manager's post. Hall held the job for one year before handing over <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> Wilson, the club's first non-English manager.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{continued}} to conspire against Emeric, although Pope Innocent III continued urging Andrew {{to launch a}} crusade. On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near Lake Balaton, which made Andrew flee to Austria. A papal legate named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a reconciliation between the two brothers. According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> {{in the summer of}} 1200.|$|E
5|$|Andrew was {{the second}} son of King Béla III and Béla's first wife, Agnes of Antioch. The year of Andrew's birth is not known, but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177. Andrew was first {{mentioned}} in connection to his father's invasion of the Principality of Halych in 1188. That year, Béla III invaded Halych upon the request of its former prince, Vladimir II Yaroslavich, who had been expelled by his subjects. Béla forced the new prince, Roman Mstislavich, to flee. After conquering Halych, he granted it <b>to</b> <b>Andrew.</b> Béla also captured Vladimir Yaroslavich and imprisoned him in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Hungarian chronicles have {{preserved}} a story full of fabulous or anachronistic {{details of}} the two brothers' ensuing wanderings. For instance, they narrate that Andrew and Levente were captured by Cumans, but the latter only arrived in Europe in the 1050s. Having faced many hardships, Andrew and Levente established themselves {{in the court of}} Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev (r. 1019–1054) in the late 1030s. The grand prince gave his daughter, Anastasia in marriage <b>to</b> <b>Andrew.</b> Kristó writes that Andrew, who had up to that time remained pagan, was baptized on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his brother would take vengeance on those who had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed <b>to</b> <b>Andrew,</b> even if they did not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E

5|$|The West Indies started well, {{winning the}} first Test comfortably by an innings and 93 runs, {{and led by}} 133 runs after the first innings of the second Test. The turning point came in the second innings of this match, as the West Indies were bowled out for 54 (this was their third lowest innings at the time). England won this Test, and they seized the {{initiative}} in the series by winning {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests thanks <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> Caddick’s four wicket over and Atherton’s century, to regain the Wisden Trophy 3–1 after a period of 31 years.|$|E
5|$|Ben-Hur {{also won}} three Golden Globe Awards – Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for Stephen Boyd – and {{received}} a Special Achievement Award (which went <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> Marton for directing the chariot race sequence).

5|$|Despite having {{played for}} the senior team, Bent was {{recalled}} to the under-21 squad for their October 2006 qualification play-offs against Germany. Later that month, he was recalled to the senior squad due to an injury <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> Johnson shortly after the squad's announcement. He was called to the England squad for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia in November 2007. He came on as an 80th-minute substitute as England lost 3–2 and failed {{to qualify for the}} tournament. He was called up to the team for a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in March 2009 following an injury to striker Carlton Cole. He made his second start for England in a 1–0 friendly defeat to Brazil on 14 November 2009. Bent was named in England's preliminary 30-man squad for the 2010 World Cup on 11 May 2010, although he was eventually omitted from the final 23-man squad on 1 June.|$|E

5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when he tossed a lateral <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> Brewer who threw it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E
5|$|However, the Orioles {{struggled}} with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, {{reported that the}} team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds.|$|E
5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy <b>to</b> <b>Andrew</b> seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III. Andrew {{emphasized}} that being under Ottoman suzerainty, Transylvania could not openly support Maximilian, {{but he also}} promised that Sigismund Báthory would not prevent the mustering of Transylvanian soldiers to fight in Poland. In the same month, Sigismund Báthory's plan to enable the Jesuits to return to Transylvania {{gave rise to a}} serious family conflict, because both Andrew and Balthasar refused to support the prince at the Diet. According to contemporaneous gossips, Andrew and his two brothers decided to dethrone Sigismund, replacing him with Balthasar. Pope Clement VIII sent a papal nuncio, Attilio Amalteo, to Transylvania to mediate a reconciliation.|$|E
