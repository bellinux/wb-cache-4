5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E

It dates back to the choirs of churches that sing during mass in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> In the middle of the 20th century, performing choral groups started to emerge and increasingly become popular as time goes by. Aside from churches, universities, schools and local communities have established choirs.|$|E
25|$|Firs – a manservant, aged 87. An aging eccentric, Firs {{considers}} the emancipation of the Russian serfs a disaster, and talks nostalgically of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> when everybody admired their masters and owners, such as Gayev's parents and grandparents. His senility {{is a source}} of much of the play's poignancy, symbolizing the decay of the old order into muttering madness.|$|E
25|$|Jianbing from Shandong {{province}} tastes crispy {{and harder}} as its batter is formed from {{the flour mixture}} that mainly contains coarse grains such as corn, sorghum and millet. In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> people had Shandong-style jianbing mainly by rolling it with scallions or serving it with meat soup. Nowadays, the variety of fillings are richer and differ according to one’s preference, for example, sweet potatoes, lettuce and pork are also used as fillings.|$|E

25|$|Persian architects {{were highly}} sought in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> {{before the advent}} of Modern Architecture. For example, Badreddin Tabrizi built the tomb of Rumi in Konya in 1273 AD, while Ostad Isa Shirazi is most often {{credited}} as the chief architect (or plan drawer) of the Taj Mahal. These artisans were also highly instrumental in the designs of such edifices as Baku, Afghanistan's Minaret of Jam, The Sultaniyeh Dome, or Tamerlane's tomb in Samarkand, among many others.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> {{relaying}} moves required {{another person}} copying the moves {{of the players}} into a large board behind the players, which was then transmitted via radio or telegram. Advancements of camera allow for zooming clearly at the players' board, although relaying moves still {{had to be done}} manually. Recently, DGT chess board captures the piece movements and allows for moves to be relayed instantaneously, eliminating the need for manual relay, but due to price (around $3000 per board), it has been limited to only a few tournaments.|$|E

But who cares what carpers think? Mary herself had no fault to find. In the roar of New York Dunsterville had suddenly become very dear to her, and she found in Eddy a sympathetic soul to whom she could open her heart.|$|R
25|$|The House {{system was}} dropped {{for a period}} of 9 years from 1972 to 1980. In 1980, it was renamed after their trustee in their full name. Gan House was {{replaced}} by Chen Su Lan House, after Dr. Chen Su Lan, another prominent trustee in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> The flags of the Houses no longer adopt their previous logos but simply a coloured flag with the name of the house spelled across the flag. Today, only 4 house names remain: Lim Boon Keng, Chan Sze Jin, Lee Cheng Yan and Chen Su Lan.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to discern the original purpose of lanterns in connection to the festival, but {{it is certain that}} lanterns were not used in conjunction with moon-worship prior to the Tang dynasty. Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself. In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths, and local cultures. Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Zapin is a {{dance form}} popular in Malaysia, {{especially}} {{in the state of}} Johor. It {{is believed to have been}} introduced by Muslim missionaries from the Middle East in the 14th century. In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> only males were allowed to perform it, but it now includes female dancers. It was once performed exclusively for religious ceremonies, but has become a traditional entertainment. The dancers usually perform in pairs, accompanied by a traditional music ensemble that typically consists of the gambus, accordion, violin, marwas (bongos), rebana (drum), and dok. There are various types of zapin—including zapin melayu, zapin pekajang, zapin tenglu, zapin pulau, zapin parit mastar, and zapin lenga.|$|E

25|$|In February 1996, Yeltsin {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the summer 1996 Russian presidential election. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin {{was at the end of}} his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero. Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.|$|E
25|$|When a man {{proposed}} to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed {{to him by}} her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for {{the back of the}} hand, leggings and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many yomeiri marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> I {{had looked}} up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E

25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} flew to Sydney, where Mike Denness {{held a press}} conference, then flew on to Adelaide for net {{practice and}} their first matches. Here they also saw Dennis Lillee in his first match since his breakdown in 1973, taking 4/82 and 3/40 for Western Australia against South Australia. Frank Tyson noted that the tour was far more hectic than <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> when the team arrived by boat. Instead of having seven first class matches and a similar number of country matches before the First Test they now only had four first class matches, and few of the England players had time to accustom themselves to local conditions. Most of the party only had two games under their belt when they played Australia at the Gabba. Also the country games were no longer two-day occasions for relaxation, but were crammed into a 10-hour, one-day flying visit, which allowed little time to be feted by the locals or for the players to rest.|$|E
25|$|Three oracles had {{successively}} {{operated in}} Delphi – the chthonion using egkoimisi (procedure that involved {{sleeping in the}} Holy place, so as to see a revealing dream), the Kliromanteion and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. But ever since {{the introduction of the}} cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy and madness, the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. In <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> Pythia was a virgin, young girl, but ever since Echecrates from Thessaly fell in love, kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.|$|E
