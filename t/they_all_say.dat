5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E
500|$|In side plots, Nina has {{recovered}} different translations of the tomes about the First People, including one from William Bell's personal safe, and realizes that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> {{the same thing}} in different languages. She identifies the name of the author of each book as an anagram of the name [...] "Sam Weiss", the bowling alley owner who she had directed Olivia to after her initial return from the parallel universe. She approaches Sam, who does not deny he wrote the books, and who explains that the doomsday device being constructed can either create or destroy a universe; how that will work will depend on Peter, who is biologically tuned to the device. Sam posits that Peter will most likely save the universe from which the Olivia he loves originates. The episode ends with Olivia reading the note from Simon, which states that Peter still has feelings for Fauxlivia.|$|E
2500|$|On the August19, 2005 {{episode of}} Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Cramer {{explained}} {{the origin of}} boo-yah: [...] "Here's what happened: A guy calls me on my radio show, and he says 'You made me a 100 smackers on K-Mart – a hundred points...' – he's from New Orleans – '...and we have one word for that down here and it's boo-yah. Then the next guy calls and he says 'you know you made {{me a lot of}} money on [...] so: boo-yah!' And now <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> it. It's not my rap".|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. Szczepanowska. Got it, by Gad. [A {{sibilant}} whispering becomes audible: <b>they</b> are <b>all</b> <b>saying</b> Sh-ch to themselves]. Szczepanowska! Not an English name, is it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2 Cit. For {{coming from}} the gods, that's no great matter, <b>they</b> can <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that: {{but he is a}} great scholar; he can make almanacks, an' he were put to it; and {{therefore}} I say, hear him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The missionaries {{are good}} men--mean well," [...] {{returned}} the Delaware courteously; [...] "they are not great medicines. <b>They</b> think <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> Deerslayer; {{that is no}} reason why warriors and orators should be all ears. When Chingachgook shall see the father of Tamenund standing in his scalp, and paint, and war lock, then will he believe the missionaries." ...|$|R
2500|$|Under Evans, Barnes {{and young}} players like Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler (who {{had been given}} their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) began playing attractive, attacking football, and were {{starting}} to look like title contenders again after several years of dominance in the title race by Manchester United as well as the likes of Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. They won the League Cup in 1995, began challenging for the FA Premier League title, and lost the 1996 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Barnes had now been converted into a holding midfielder where he, Redknapp and McManaman would pass their way through teams and set up goals. He often captained the side in 1995–96 when regular captain Ian Rush lost his place to new signing Stan Collymore, and when Rush departed to Leeds United {{at the end of the}} season he became full-time captain. Barnes played a pivotal role in the midfield, and created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Stan Collymoore during Liverpool's 4–3 win at Anfield against Newcastle. A young Jamie Carragher was breaking through into the team towards the end of Barnes's career at Liverpool and said that despite Barnes supposedly being past his peak by then, in his 34th year, he was still the best player at the club. [...] "Technically, he’s the best player I've ever trained or played with, he was great with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I'd say he's the best finisher I've ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots – they’d just get placed right in the corner. You speak with the players from those great Liverpool sides and ask them who the best player they played with was and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> John Barnes".|$|E
60|$|OFFICER (impersonally to horizon). But <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that nowadays.|$|E
60|$|COLLINS. Bless you, maam, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that. You and me said it, I'll lay. I did, anyhow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care whether}} there's {{one or a}} dozen,' said Mr Flintwinch, {{forcibly}} suggesting in his tone that the higher number was nearer the mark. 'If there was fifty, <b>they</b> should <b>all</b> <b>say,</b> None of your nonsense with me, I won't take it from you--I'd make 'em say it, whether they liked it or not.' ...|$|R
60|$|The French always call Mont Blanc the Mont Blanc, and for {{all clear}} and in plain view <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> uncovered.|$|R
5000|$|This VGX teaser brought much {{attention}} to the title from the gaming press. Duncan noted that following the reveal, he found it [...] "incredible how many developers came up to us afterwards, and <b>they</b> were <b>all</b> <b>saying</b> this is the game I always wanted to be making, or I started working on a game like this".|$|R
6000|$|... "What matthers, Father John; what matthers? Shure they've {{all heard}} too much already;--don't <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> she's the blackguard's misthress?" ...|$|E
60|$|AMAH. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> to poor Chinese, {{love one}} another. I no think missionaries {{love one another}} velly much. Hi, hi.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{plenty of}} time for Mount Earnshawe yet. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> the autumn is the best. The snow is now disappearing in great quantities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know it {{is pretty}} cold here. <b>They</b> can <b>say</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> want to about the cold and all that out in Minnesota, but, really, the humidity----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No forts {{to it at}} <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>say.</b> The Spaniards boast, that Heaven {{has made}} such good walls to it already, that man need make none." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now,' {{said the}} old woman, 'you can go and play and talk with the dogs, cats, birds, and trees, for you will {{understand}} <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>they</b> will understand <b>all</b> you say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy {{was only}} {{restrained}} from tears by fear of his father, and just managed to say, [...] "'Tis what <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say,</b> and Perry knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> so. That {{funny little}} doctor yesterday--he made me tired--but he said so. I heard him as dad put {{him into the}} car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Darling Mousie, dear sweet mother, {{we shall}} soon be {{together}} again. Is {{not that good}} news? And it is true; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> it is true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean ugly behaved, and <b>they</b> deserve <b>all</b> I <b>say</b> of 'em. Their ar'nd, {{according}} to their own tell, is to seize the captain, and his family, in behalf of the colonies." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh dear, the cold; but it's worth any cold to {{have that}} delicious Robin dialogue. Please write some more of it; you hear <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> I'm sure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do so {{wish the}} room below was ceiled," [...] said Fancy, as the {{dressing}} went on; [...] "we can hear <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> and do down there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no; nor Sam. It was Nurse herself! But <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> {{that you}} want to take away her character; and they won't have strangers put over them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wait {{till you}} get out there, Regie, and see what <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> about those lazy fellows--except, of course, ladies and parsons, and a few whom they've bitten, like May.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Sir Alfred Anselman! He {{has done}} such {{wonderful}} {{things for the}} country. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> {{that he ought to}} have been in the Cabinet. Hugh, you can't be serious!" ...|$|E
60|$|As Mr. Perrott {{proceeded}} to deliver an opinion, and Evelyn {{insisted that he}} was much too stingy, like all lawyers, thinking of the letter and not of the spirit, while Mrs. Paley required to be kept informed between the courses as to what <b>they</b> were <b>all</b> <b>saying,</b> the luncheon passed with no interval of silence, and Arthur congratulated himself upon the tact with which the discussion had been smoothed over.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brother is}} a judge out in Chicago. It {{was he who}} signed the warrant for Maraton's arrest. I'm afraid our people are getting much too scared, nowadays, about that sort of thing. We don't {{seem to be able}} to enforce our laws like you do over here. <b>They</b> are <b>all</b> <b>saying</b> now that it ought to have been served and the man shot if there had been any resistance." ...|$|R
60|$|Both good sound observations, and <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could <b>say</b> for a time, while Mr. Wrenn {{examined}} the under {{side of the}} iron steps rail minutely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you? <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> she is {{a perfect}} Charnock, though how they know I can't guess. There," [...] after a little more baby-worship, [...] "you may take her Emma." ...|$|E
6000|$|This amused her. [...] "I know, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say</b> {{they have}} to wear out their Sunday go-to-meeting clothes, whereas I can 'rag out proper.' I'm glad you like my 'rig.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the gentleman}} {{dressed in white}} paper leaned {{forwards}} and whispered in her ear, 'Never mind what <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>say,</b> my dear, but take a return-ticket every time the train stops.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are not dull, {{and they}} do not frighten me," [...] {{answered}} Tua; [...] "they talk to me, and although I cannot understand <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> I am happy with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the soldier}} said; [...] "2000 {{of the enemy}} have {{advanced}} up the western side, and have occupied Romney, and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> Patterson's force is on the move." ...|$|R
60|$|But Mr Melmotte {{would not}} rise again. He {{had made a}} great effort, and had at any rate {{exhibited}} his courage. Though <b>they</b> might <b>all</b> <b>say</b> {{that he had not}} displayed much eloquence, they would be driven to admit that he had not been ashamed to show himself. He kept his seat till the regular stampede was made for dinner, and then walked out with as stately a demeanour as he could assume.|$|R
