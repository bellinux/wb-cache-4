25|$|Touch {{research}} conducted by Jones and Yarbrough (1985) revealed 18 different meanings of touch, grouped in seven types: Positive affect (emotion), playfulness, control, ritual, hybrid (mixed), <b>task-related,</b> and accidental touch.|$|E
25|$|In the reach-to-grasp task rodents {{learned a}} skilled forelimb task. Sleep {{improved}} movement speed with preservation of accuracy. These offline improvements {{were linked to}} both replay of <b>task-related</b> ensembles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements.|$|E
25|$|Environmental and <b>task-related</b> {{factors are}} {{suspected}} {{to trigger the}} development of focal dystonias because they appear disproportionately in individuals who perform high precision hand movements such as musicians, engineers, architects, and artists. Chlorpromazine can also cause dystonia, which can be often misjudged as a seizure.|$|E
25|$|In a neuroprosthetic task rodents {{trained to}} perform a simple brain–machine {{interface}} task in which the activity {{of a set of}} motor cortical units was used to control a mechanical arm attached to a feeding spout. After successful learning, <b>task-related</b> units specifically experienced increased locking and coherency to slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep. The time spent in SWA predicted the performance gains upon awakening.|$|E
25|$|Babin et al. {{carried out}} some of the {{earliest}} investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian motivations are <b>task-related</b> and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.|$|E
25|$|The goal of fMRI data {{analysis}} is to detect correlations between brain activation and a task the subject performs during the scan. It also aims to discover correlations {{with the specific}} cognitive states, such as memory and recognition, induced in the subject. The BOLD signature of activation is relatively weak, however, so other sources of noise in the acquired data must be carefully controlled. This means that a series of processing steps must be performed on the acquired images before the actual statistical search for <b>task-related</b> activation can begin. Nevertheless, {{it is possible to}} predict, for example, the emotions a person is experiencing solely from their fMRI, {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|E
500|$|The elderly often {{experience}} {{deficits in}} cognitive flexibility. [...] The aging brain undergoes physical and functional changes including {{a decline in}} processing speed, central sensory functioning, white matter integrity, and brain volume. [...] Regions associated with cognitive flexibility such as the PFC and PC atrophy, or shrink, with age, but also show greater <b>task-related</b> activation in older individuals when compared to younger individuals. This increase in blood flow is potentially related to the evidence that atrophy heightens blood flow and metabolism, which is measured as the BOLD response, or blood-oxygen-level dependence, with fMRI. [...] Studies suggest that aerobic exercise and training can have plasticity inducing effects that could potentially serve as an intervention in old age that combat the decline in executive function.|$|E
500|$|Studies on freely moving {{rats and}} mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action {{potentials}} when the animal passes through a particular location. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair. [...] However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather that to its actual location in the room. Over many years, many studies {{have been carried out}} on place-responses in rodents, that have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate which are much weaker. [...] There is little if any spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next {{to each other in the}} hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz, when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat's location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also on the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other <b>task-related</b> variables.|$|E

2500|$|Motivation {{involves}} three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity. Arousal is what initiates action. It {{is often}} {{fueled by a}} person's need or desire for something that is missing {{from his or her}} life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve four factors. [...] First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of <b>task-related</b> strategies.|$|E
2500|$|Haptic {{communication}} is {{a branch of}} nonverbal communication that refers {{to the ways in}} which people and animals communicate, and interact via the sense of touch. Touch or haptics, from the ancient Greek word haptikos is extremely important for communication; it [...] is vital for survival. The sense of touch [...] allows one to experience different sensations such as: pleasure, pain, heat, or cold. [...] One of the most significant aspects of touch is the ability to convey and enhance physical intimacy. The sense of [...] touch is the fundamental component of haptic communication for interpersonal relationships.Touch can be categorized in many terms such [...] as positive, playful, control, ritualistic, <b>task-related</b> or unintentional. It can be both sexual (kissing is one example that some perceived as sexual), and platonic (such as hugging or a Handshake).|$|E
2500|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping {{in patients}} with epilepsy has shown that critical language {{areas of the brain}} vary greatly in patients, highlighting the need to perform accurate mapping prior to surgeries in language areas. Traditional landmarks such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas cannot be relied on to distinguish essential language cortex. Rather, experiments that have tested for vital language sites are variable, and the exact role of a specific cortex area in a language task is difficult to judge. A further complication is that many patients who have undergone language mapping have epilepsy and it is possible this causes changes in language sites. Since the procedure is so invasive, cortical stimulation mapping for language organization is not done on healthy individuals. [...] Additionally the distribution and abundance of specific <b>task-related</b> language sites have shown variation based on IQ and gender.|$|E
2500|$|Price et al., 1997; Rumsey et al., 1997a). Brain imaging {{studies have}} also {{characterized}} the anomalous patterns of neuronal activation associated with reading and phonological processing in adults with persistent or compensated developmental dyslexia (e.g., Brunswick et al., 1999; Demonet et al., 1992; Flowers et al., 1991; Horwitz et al., 1998; Ingvar et al., 1993; Paulesu et al., 1996; Pugh et al., 2000; Rumsey et al., 1997b; Shaywitz et al., 1998). [...] Employing various experimental approaches and paradigms (e.g., the detection or judgment of rhymes, nonword reading, and implicit reading), these studies have localized dysfunctional phonological processing in dyslexia to left-hemisphere perisylvian regions. Differences in <b>task-related</b> signal change in the left temporoparietal and occipitotemporal cortices have emerged as the most consistent findings in studies of dyslexia in the [...] alphabetic writing system (Paulesu et al., 2001; for review, see Eden and Zeffiro, 1998). However, it has been demonstrated that in nonalphabetic scripts, where reading places less demands on phonemic processing and the integration of visual-orthographic information is crucial, dyslexia is associated with under activity of the left middle frontal gyrus (Siok et al., 2004).|$|E
50|$|Interpersonal {{conflict}} is generally detrimental to team cohesion, and, in turn, is destructive to team performance. While team members may correct each other, offer alternatives and argue {{about how to}} solve a problem, some level of <b>task-related</b> conflict can promote optimal performance. In contrast, interpersonal and <b>task-related</b> aspects of cohesion are generally found to influence performance positively. A study conducted with Canadian military groups showed that <b>task-related</b> cohesion {{was positively related to}} individual job satisfaction, interpersonal cohesion was negatively related to reports of psychological distress, and both types of cohesion were positively related to job performance.|$|E

50|$|One theory {{regarding}} selective {{attention is}} the cognitive load theory, {{which states that}} there are two mechanisms that affect attention: cognitive and perceptual. The perceptual considers the subject’s ability to perceive or ignore stimuli, both <b>task-related</b> and non <b>task-related.</b> Studies show that if there are many stimuli present (especially if they are <b>task-related),</b> {{it is much easier to}} ignore the non-task related stimuli, but if there are few stimuli the mind will perceive the irrelevant stimuli as well as the relevant. The cognitive refers to the actual processing of the stimuli. Studies regarding this showed that the ability to process stimuli decreased with age, meaning that younger people were able to perceive more stimuli and fully process them, but were likely to process both relevant and irrelevant information, while older people could process fewer stimuli, but usually processed only relevant information.|$|E

50|$|Each of {{the five}} stages in the Forming-storming-norming-performing-adjourning model {{proposed}} by Tuckman involves two aspects: interpersonal relationships and task behaviors. Such a distinction is similar to Bales' (1950) equilibrium model which states that a group continuously divides its attention between instrumental (<b>task-related)</b> and expressive (socioemotional) needs.|$|E

50|$|Brain {{to brain}} {{interfaces}} {{have been used}} to help rats collaborate with each other.

50|$|For many {{physically}} interactive manipulation tasks, such as {{writing and}} handling a screwdriver, a <b>task-related</b> grasp criterion {{can be applied}} in order to choose grasps that are most appropriate to meeting specific task requirements.

50|$|The SHELL model {{adopts a}} systems {{perspective}} that suggests the human is rarely, if ever, the sole cause of an accident.

As a result, the SHELL model considers both active and latent failures in the aviation system.|$|E
50|$|In {{a visual}} {{semantic}} priming paradigm, P2 amplitude differences {{are associated with}} phase-locked theta brain wave oscillations. Among the complex of the P1, N1 and P2, the P2 shows the strongest <b>task-related</b> modulation of theta wave oscillations between congruent and incongruent tasks.

50|$|According to Flor (1991), Scenario Construction and Analysis {{could be}} used in {{analysing}} communication policy. Scenario is a description technique that has been attracting a lot of attention from practitioners and from researchers.

50|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model of}} CWBs distinguished by organizational versus person target has gained considerable acceptance. Additional dimensions {{have been proposed}} for research purposes, including a legal v. illegal dimension, a hostile v. instrumental aggression dimension, and a <b>task-related</b> v. a non-task-related dimension. CWBs that violate criminal law may have different antecedents than milder forms of CWBs. Similarly, instrumental aggression (i.e., aggression with a deliberate goal in mind) may have different antecedents than those CWBs caused by anger.|$|E
50|$|The {{main focus}} of the {{analysis}} was the continuous observation of communication patterns in literature circles. The main concern was over how these variables affected the language development of foreign language learners. For {{the analysis of the}} collected data, Bales’ Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) system was used especially to identify and record the nature of each separate act in ongoing group interaction. IPA is devised by Bales for the continuous observation of communication patterns in interactive groups. It is mainly {{based on the assumption that}} group success depends on both how well the group can solve its tasks (task function) and how satisfied it can keep its members (socio-emotional function). Bales identified 12 interactional “moves” in four categories: (1) socio-emotional positive (shows solidarity, tension reduction, agreement); (2) socio-emotional negative (shows antagonism, tension, disagreement); (3) <b>task-related</b> attempted solutions (gives suggestions, opinions, orientation); and (4) <b>task-related</b> questions (asks for suggestions, opinions, orientation). At least one rater observes each group member, and scores occurrences of each interactional “move.” This method has been used in a variety of settings, and is a reliable and useful way to analyze group interactions according to Antony S.R. Manstead.|$|E
50|$|The TEAM model also postulates the {{existence}} of two distinguishable activity tracks present throughout all the stages. The first of these tracks involves activities that {{are tied to the}} specific task(s) being performed. These activities include interactions of the team members with tools and machines, the technical aspects of the job (e.g., procedures, policies, etc.), and other <b>task-related</b> activities. The other track of activities is devoted to enhancing the quality of the interactions, interdependencies, relationships, affects, cooperation, and coordination of teams.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between private speech and behavioral self-regulation is further demonstrated by {{research showing that}} children use more private speech when asked to do more difficult tasks or when asked to do tasks {{without the help of}} a teacher or parent. In other words, in circumstances when more behavioral self-regulation is required of a young child, the child is more likely to use private speech. Private speech has also been linked to three-year-olds' ability to engage in <b>task-related</b> goals, when explicitly taught to use private speech as a strategy for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|According to The Alphabet of Manliness, the {{assigning}} {{of blame}} for farting {{is part of}} a ritual of behaviour. This may involve deception and a back and forth rhyming game, for example, [...] "He who smelt it, dealt it" [...] and [...] "He who denied it, supplied it". Derived terms include fanny fart (queef), brain fart (slang for a special kind of abnormal brain activity which results in human error while performing a repetitive task, or more generally denoting a degree of mental laxity or any <b>task-related</b> forgetfulness, such as forgetting how to hold a fork) and old fart.|$|E
