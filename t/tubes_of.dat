5|$|Legitimate use of Preludin {{required}} a doctor's prescription, but Kirchherr's mother {{was able to}} obtain it from a local chemist who supplied the drug without asking questions. Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> Preludin. Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{forty minutes}} after his collapse, a police {{helicopter}} took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, {{where he was}} pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E

5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, {{but there are so many}} such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> the 53rd Street Tunnel {{under the}} East River began {{construction}} in spring 1927, and were fully excavated between Queens and Manhattan in January 1929, with a ventilation shaft built on Welfare Island (today's Roosevelt Island). On October 4, 1928, the Board of Estimate approved {{the construction of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. During the line's construction, several intersections of Queens Boulevard with major roads were grade separated, in a similar manner to Grand Concourse in the Bronx during the building of the IND Concourse Line around that same time. At adjacent intersections with Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) in Elmhurst, Queens Boulevard's main road was depressed into underpasses. In Kew Gardens, Union Turnpike and the Interboro Parkway (now the Jackie Robinson Parkway) were depressed below Queens Boulevard {{at the level of the}} Union Turnpike station's mezzanine. The subway from Long Island City to Roosevelt Avenue and 74th Street was completed by April 1932.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{destructive}} effects of gunpowder were {{described in the}} earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} a swan, and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} superheater was to increase the temperature differential between inner and outer <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> the bank, thus encouraging circulation. The two water drums were often linked by unheated downcomers, to allow this flow between the drums. This effect was later encouraged in the Admiralty boiler, where the <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> a bank were curved apart to leave space for a superheater, whilst retaining the single water drum.|$|E
