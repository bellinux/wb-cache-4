40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the incidence and prevalence of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> in Taiwan {{in the period}} spanning from 2002 to 2011. METHODS: We identified all incident and prevalent cases with a diagnosis of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 443. 1) in the period spanning from 2002 to 2011 using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. We calculated the age- and sex-specific incidence and prevalence rates of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> during the study period. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2011, 158 patients were diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans; of these, 76 % were men. Most (63 %) of the patients were < 50 years old {{when they were first}} diagnosed. After reaching 20 years of age, the incidence rate increased with age and peaked among those aged ≥ 60 years. The average incidence rate of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> during the 2002 – 2011 period was 0. 068 per 105 years. The incidence of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> decreased with time, from 0. 10 per 105 years in 2002 to 0. 04 per 105 years in 2011. The prevalence increased from 0. 26 × 10 − 5 in 2002 to 0. 65 × 10 − 5 in 2011. CONCLUSION: This is the first epidemiologic study of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> using claims data from a general population in Taiwan. This nationwide, population-based study found that the incidence and prevalence of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> in Taiwan in the 2002 – 2011 period were lower than those in other countries before 2000.

40|$|Introduction and Objective: The Raynaud's {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} episodic, recurrent, reversible vasospasm of the fingers and toes, usually induced by cold. The prevalence of Raynaud's syndrome {{in the general population}} is between 0. 5 and 4. 3 %. A connection between Raynaud's syndrome and certain diseases has not yet been systematically investigated. The aim of this thesis is to investigate a possible association between Raynaud's syndrome and carpal tunnel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> in three meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted and studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the meta-analyzes. Based on the available data, the prevalence of the three mentioned diseases for the Raynaud's syndrome was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the methods of a meta-analysis including a random-effects model and a mixture model for proportions. A metaregression was also performed based on the period of publication. Results: In all three observed diseases the prevalence of the Raynaud's syndrome are significantly higher than in the general population. The random effects model showed an overall estimate of 15. 5 % in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 12. 3 % in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 28. 1 % in patients with <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans.</b> Statistically only with <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> a publication bias was not present. Prevalence estimates were heterogeneous. When looking at finite mixture models, five classes were found in carpal tunnel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis and four classes in <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans.</b> The results of the meta-regression were only statistically significant with the carpal tunnel syndrome and suggest that the estimated prevalence increases with the increase of the period of the publications. Discussion: The heterogeneity of prevalence is probably {{due to the lack of}} a precise definition of the Raynaud's syndrome in the individual studies. The significance of two meta-analysis (carpal tunnel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis) is limited due to an existing publication bias. However it can be said that the meta-analysis indicate a possible association between the Raynaud's syndrome on the one hand and the diseases (carpal tunnel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans)</b> on the other hand. The significance of the observed disease <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> as a risk factor for Raynaud's {{syndrome is}} quantitative (prevalence 28. 1 %) and qualitatively (no publication bias) the highest...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a new phase}} {{in the study of}} tobacco and its effect on the human body. Prior to this, interest was centered largely on the analysis of tobacco with a view to determining the importance of the toxins contained in it and produced by it in the process of smoking. Attention, however, became turned toward the possibility that most, if not all, of the harmful effects of the plant might be an allergic manifestation, due to sensitization of the individual. The skin test naturally was assumed to afford a representation of whatever sensitization was present. The consistently large percentage of patients with <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> showing positive skin tests to tobacco led to the conclusion 10 that in the pathogenesis of this disease an allergic state to tobacco might be a fundamental factor. In order, however, to substantiate such a condusion it is necessary to be assured that the skin reaction produced by tobacco extract is a specific response designating an allergic condition of the blood vessels. It was with this in mind that the following studies were undertaken. Reviewv of Literature The attempt to relate an allergic activity of tobacco to the natural history of certain of the less well-understood vascular diseases was begun by the work of Harkavy, Hebald, and Silbert 10 in 1932. Barker 11 had demonstrated that there was a greater consumption of tobacco in cases of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> than in any other disease group, and upon this basis Harkavy and his coworkers built their theory that cases of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> might show a, larger percentage of positive skin reactions to tobacco extracts than would other individuals. They found that 83 per cent of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> cases reacted positively to one or another of the five tobacco extracts used, as opposed to 1 0 per cent positive reactions in the control group...|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 113 non diabetic patients with premature peripheral arterial disease (diagnosis < 45 -year old) presenting either a peripheral arterial occlusive disease (N =  64) or a <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> (N =  49), and 241 controls matched for age and gender. Both patient groups demonstrated common traits including cigarette smoking, low physical activity, decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (active form of B 6 vitamin) and zinc. Premature peripheral arterial occlusive disease was characterized by the presence of a family history of peripheral arterial and carotid artery diseases (OR 2. 3 and 5. 8 respectively, 95 % CI), high lipoprotein (a) levels above 300 mg/L (OR 2. 3, 95 % CI), the presence of the factor V Leiden (OR 5. 1, 95 % CI) and the glycoprotein Ia(807 T, 837 T, 873 A) allele (OR 2. 3, 95 % CI).

40|$|BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: <b>Thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans</b> (TAO, Buerger’s Disease) is a rare, segmental, non-atherosclerotic {{vasculitis}} {{that causes}} thrombosis and occlusion {{of the small}} and medium sized vessels of the distal extremities. However, it can, in rare cases, affect vessels in the gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, coronary, and renal systems. The etiology of TAO is unknown, {{but there is a}} strong association with smoking in the development and the progression of the disease. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discuss diagnosis and complications of <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans,</b> including a rare manifestation of the disease found in a 42 -year-old woman with TAO. CASE REPORT: A 42 -year-old homeless Caucasian female was found dead, outdoors, near her campsite. Records show she was assaulted five days prior and she sustained a broken nose and a concussion from that incident. Her medical history was significant for a post-traumatic seizure disorder related to a closed head injury that occurred over two decades prior to death, alcoholism, Buerger’s disease, hypertension, COPD, hepatitis C and remote breast cancer. Although initial investigation suggested that the death might be related to trauma, autopsy revealed no significant trauma. However, the autopsy did reveal a thrombus occluding her left carotid artery. Microscopic examination revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation within vessel walls as well as atherosclerosis and intraluminal thrombosis. Corresponding brain tissue showed softening of the area supplied by the left internal carotid artery, which microscopically was determined to be due to acute ischemic necrosis. In addition, examination of the lungs was consistent with COPD. It was concluded that <b>thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans,</b> likely precipitated by smoking, was the cause of the thrombus, and thus her cause of death. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: <b>Thromboangiitis</b> <b>obliterans,</b> though a relatively rare disease, can cause significant complications, including ulceration, gangrene and life threatening thrombosis. Proper diagnosis, though hindered by conflicting diagnostic criteria, is the first step in preventing these complications. As the present case reveals, manifestations beyond the extremity vessels can be life-threatening, so it is important that physicians be aware of these possible complications when treating patients with TAO...|$|E
