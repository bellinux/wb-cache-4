5|$|After the match, Hulk Hogan came to ring {{to check}} on Hart's condition. Hogan had stated during an {{interview}} earlier in the broadcast that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>face</b> {{the winner of the}} match, and Fuji challenged Hogan <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Yokozuna immediately in an impromptu bout. Hogan agreed and entered the ring. Fuji tried to throw salt in Hogan's eyes, but he missed and the salt hit Yokozuna. Hogan performed a leg drop and pinned Yokozuna to win the title in 22 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After their thriller against Illinois, the Wolverines {{traveled}} to rainy West Lafayette, Indiana <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the Purdue Boilermakers.

40|$|In Lewicki’s (1986 a) {{demonstration}} of Hidden Co-variation Detection (HCD), responses were slower <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> that corresponded with a co-variation encountered previously than <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> with novel co-variations. This slowing {{contrasts with the}} typical finding that priming leads to faster responding, and might suggest that HCD is a unique type of implicit process. We extended Lewicki’s (1986 a) methodology and showed that participants exposed to nonsalient co-variations between hair length and personality were subsequently faster <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> with those co-variations than <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> without, despite lack of awareness of the critical co-variations. This result confirms that people can detect subtle relationships between features of stimuli and that, as {{with other types of}} implicit cognition, this detection facilitates responding. </p...|$|R

5|$|Australia's manager Frank Farina criticised the {{qualification}} {{format and}} questioned {{the need for}} these kind of matches. Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, was delighted with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's comments. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both comments and suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both comments and claimed that the smaller teams have the right <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights <b>to</b> <b>face</b> stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E

5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers.

Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the difficult bowling.|$|E
