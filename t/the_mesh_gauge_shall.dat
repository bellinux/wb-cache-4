This is presently progressing in a further EU project named OMEGA. Prototypes of the new device have been produced and a number of introductory tests have already been made. This contribution reports on further laboratory tests carried out at the Institute for Fishing technology and Fish Quality with special emphasis on netting yarn diameters below 4 mm.

40|$|I {{present a}} new method for {{numerical}} simulations of general relativistic systems that eliminates constraint violating modes {{without the need}} for constraint damping or the introduction of extra dynamical fields. The method is a type of variational integrator. It is based on a discretization of an action for gravity (the Plebański action) on an unstructured <b>mesh</b> that preserves <b>the</b> local Lorentz transformation and diffeomorphism symmetries of the continuous action. Applying Hamilton's principle of stationary action gives discrete field equations on <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b> For each <b>gauge</b> degree of freedom there is a corresponding discrete constraint; the remaining discrete evolution equations exactly preserve these constraints under time-evolution. I validate the method using simulations of several analytically solvable spacetimes: a weak gravitational wave spacetime, the Schwarzschild spacetime, and the Kerr spacetime. by Will M. Farr.

40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in <b>the</b> standardization of <b>mesh</b> measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard <b>mesh</b> <b>gauge</b> (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines <b>the</b> different <b>mesh</b> measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective <b>mesh</b> <b>gauge</b> (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic {{solution}} adaptive mesh {{method was}} implemented into a finite-volume numerical method for solving unsteady flowfields {{described by the}} two-dimensional, unsteady, Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. The objective was to improve the resolution and accuracy of solutions which contained flow gradients which varied in strength and position with time. Variational principles were used to formulate <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> equations with which meshes were generated to have the desired smoothness, orthogonality, and volume adaption qualities. The adaption of <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> to <b>the</b> flow solution was driven {{by the presence of}} flow gradients.

50|$|A shared mesh (also {{known as}} ‘traditional’ or ‘best effort’ mesh) is a {{wireless}} mesh network {{that uses a}} single radio to communicate via mesh backhaul links to all the neighboring nodes in <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b> This is a first generation <b>mesh</b> where <b>the</b> total available bandwidth of the radio channel is ‘shared’ between all the neighboring nodes in <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b> <b>The</b> capacity of the channel is further consumed by traffic being forwarded from one node to the next in <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> - reducing <b>the</b> end to end traffic that can be passed. Because bandwidth is shared amongst all nodes in <b>the</b> <b>mesh,</b> and because every link in <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> uses additional capacity, this type of network offers much lower end to end transmission rates than a switched mesh and degrades in capacity as nodes are added to <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The study {{describes}} a modified technique for ventral hernia repair {{based upon a}} tension free, fixation free, and dynamic compliant implant. Material and methods: A unique geometrical shaped light weighted, large porous polypropylene mesh was created consisting of a large central body and six radial arms, designed {{to pass through the}} tissues and hold <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> in place without tension. We used <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> in a small exploratory cohort of patients with ventral hernia. <b>The</b> <b>mesh</b> was placed sublay by taking each of the six straps and passing from below the muscle, through the muscle allowing the fixation free strap to sit with friction within the tissues. This was designed to give a tension free fixation, yet be strong enough to ensure <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> remained orientated during early healing. Each mesh was inserted with at least 30 % overlap of the defect to ensure adequate coverage. Follow up was made at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results: Procedures were all completed with no need for additional fixation of <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b> <b>The</b> only minor complication was oozing from a drain site in an early patient with a very large ventral hernia. Initial reduction of the hernia was witnessed in all patients, but the full result of reduction through incorporation and shrinkage of <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> was seen at 3 months. There were no reports of chronic pain, hematoma or nerve entrapment. Patient satisfaction was subjective but considered high. Conclusion: The arm system of <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> allowed for a much smaller incision and removed the complicated maneuvers of suturing <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b> <b>The</b> fixation arms seemed to have ensured <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> stayed orientated in all patients during the crucial initial incorporation of <b>the</b> <b>mesh.</b> <b>The</b> extra large size of <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> had two functions. Firstly it allowed a very wide lateral placement, ensuring there is sufficient overlap, when shrinkage occurs. But it also guaranteed that <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> was placed tension free.
