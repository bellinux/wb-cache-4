500|$|... "Hasta la Raíz" [...] {{was written}} by Lafourcade and Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel García, since Lafourcade wanted to {{experiment}} with other composers on her music and they became friends while working on her album Mujer Divina and his album Todas Mías (2012). García had an idea about the song, and they finished together the music. [...] Laforcade referred to this collaboration as [...] "magical", with this song being an anthem to the human strength, without forgetting our roots, [...] "It {{came out of a}} conversation about maintaining a sense of connection <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> come from." [...] García played a huapango riff, and Lafourcade started singing along while producer Cachorro López recorded everything, and the final result is from that session.|$|E

Overall, Part II presents the unexpected aspects of living in the United States and becoming Americans, and explores the tensions that develop with the immigrant experience.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the case}} also aroused {{controversy}} about the court itself. [...] David Marr described the four to three decision as indicating a new {{division in the}} composition of the court, the [...] "liberty divide", and noted that the result on the liberty question moved the court in the opposite direction to the contemporary trends of the Supreme Court of the United States and the House of Lords. Arthur Glass observed that the minority judges began their judgments from the position that indefinite non-judicial detention and the curtailment of personal freedom were troubling consequences, and noted that [...] "as is not uncommon in statutory construction, where you start from is critical <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> end up." [...] Marr accused the majority of deciding that [...] "saving Australia from boat people counts for more than Al-Kateb's raw liberty." ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth track, [...] "Electric", is an {{electronic}} funk song with elements of reggae music. The title track holds a [...] "convinced relativism", according to Robert Christgau, while [...] "Main Thing", {{a cover of}} Shot's 1986 single, explores deep house, disco and funk genres. The ninth track, [...] "Giving You Back", is a piano ballad that addresses Robyn's abortion as she sings [...] "I'm giving you back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> came from but I'm not forgetting who you are". David Schmader of The Stranger opined that it features a directness that is [...] "unprecedented in pop", and compared its piano elements {{to those found in}} Braxton's work. The following track, [...] "88 Days", lyrically reflects on the abortion while showcasing a pop and R sound. The thirteenth and final track, [...] "Universal Woman", for which Robyn received sole writing credit, exhibits both intelligence and emotional authority, according to Bjurman.|$|E

I think this speaks volumes <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that.

500|$|Hopsin {{spoke on}} [...] "Hip Hop Sinister" [...] saying, [...] "That's {{probably}} the most intense rap song on the album. It's not a song that's going to slowly change anybody's life. It's just a rap song just have bars and sound dope. The energy on that, you'll probably hear it and want to cut somebody's throat. The song just amps you up so much. It's so hyped <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want to punch a hole in somebody's head or punch a hole through the wall." [...] "Good Guys Get Left Behind" [...] is a love song, that features multiple twists and turns. [...] "Old Friend" [...] is based around {{a friend of his}} that became addicted to methamphetamine and the personal issues which he suffered from it.

500|$|The song's exhortation to [...] "Get back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> should be" [...] {{was partly}} {{appropriated}} by McCartney in his lyrics to [...] "Get Back", which the Beatles recorded in January 1969. Both sides of Lomax's single were included on his only album for Apple, Is This What You Want?, released in March 1969. The album similarly {{failed to achieve}} commercial success, a result that perplexed the Beatles, who continued to believe in his talents. Due to the song's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton, [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] retained a degree of renown among rock music fans; Danny Eccleston of Mojo magazine later {{described it as a}} [...] "cult rendering". In 1970, Sour Milk Sea, one of singer Freddie Mercury's pre-Queen bands, was named after the track. In June the following year, Apple re-released [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] with [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] on the B-side, but this single also failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{uses her}} life {{experiences}} as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the [...] "anonymous crushes of {{her high school}} years" [...] and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically [...] "because these are real people. You try to give insight as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".|$|E

500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally got <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E
500|$|While {{singing the}} lines [...] "So rock {{right up to}} the side of my {{mountain}} / Climb until you reach my peak babe my peak, the peak / And reach right into the bottom of my fountain", Beyoncé uses sexual innuendos. [...] She also incorporates similar double entendres and euphemisms in the lyrics, [...] "Reach right into the bottom of my fountain / dip me under <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can feel my river flow / Rock it till water falls". During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E
500|$|Louder Now {{received}} {{a score of}} 64 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate considered the album [...] "closer to Northstar's Pollyanna" [...] than <b>to</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want to Be, {{and said that the}} music wasn't [...] "anything mind-blowing. I don't get knocked on my ass like I did the first time I heard TAYF, but the catchy repetitiveness is all there." [...] AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar called the album's name [...] "an apt title for a super-tight, aggressive album that falls somewhere between their last two, tapping the heartfelt vigor of Tell All Your Friends in order to give Where You Want to Be a swift, square kick in the pants." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press that the band [...] " [...] spot-on when they floor it or put it in park; it’s the sputtering along in-between that hurts the record." [...] Despite not mastering [...] "the art of the middle ground," [...] they take [...] "immense leaps forward musically on their third album." [...] According to Heisel, the band should be [...] "commended, not for just choosing not to rehash their older work, but for truly trying to branch out artistically—and succeeding most of the time." ...|$|E

500|$|While both mining {{activity}} and natural faults could be causative factors, {{it is difficult}} to establish a precise cause. According to Professor Andrzej Kijko from the University of Pretoria's Natural Hazard Centre, mining can activate natural faults. He believes that more than 90% of South Africa's earthquakes are caused by mining, especially around the areas of Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Welkom. According to Hartnady, [...] "This part of Africa is {{in the vicinity of the}} East African Rift system, which is being pulled apart by a few millimetres annually." [...] He says [...] "earthquakes are caused by a slip on a fault line and the release of stored elastic energy" [...] and {{mining activity}} could have triggered the earthquake. Kijko and Hartnady believe that – unlike the 1969 Tulbagh earthquake – this event was a mining-related earthquake which is a relatively more common occurrence than a natural earthquake in South Africa. Professor Ray Durrheim, a seismologist at Wits University, said seismic events will continue while there is mining activity in the area, and even long afterwards. He said the flooding of inactive mines could also compound pressure on geological faults, triggering further seismic events. According to Durrheim, the link between mining and earthquakes lies [...] "on a continuum, from where it's purely induced by mining activities <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are triggering a natural earthquake".|$|E
500|$|Kyle Ryan of the A.V. Club called Taking Back Sunday's {{sound on}} their debut album [...] "fresh and raw" [...] and their {{approach}} to Louder Now [...] "formulaic." [...] According to Ryan, Lazzara [...] "changed his style a bit" [...] and [...] "occasionally sound like his jaw is wired shut." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title [...] "justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses" [...] compared <b>to</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has [...] "a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies," [...] with the [...] "emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for." [...] Gigwise contributor Lee Glynn wrote that the album had [...] "no standout tracks" [...] other than [...] "MakeDamnSure." [...] Apart from the latter, [...] "there is nothing on this album that reaffirms them as a band full of malice and bite." [...] Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.7 out of 10: [...] "It's a safe bet to say that TBS diehards will soak up the 11 tracks with a sponge-like vengeance. Newcomers may wonder what all {{the bells and whistles}} are about, though. But tracks like 'My Blue Heaven', 'Spin', 'Divine Intervention' and 'I'll Let You Live' promise even greater things to come from this band, who are only now hinting at their growing sonic maturity." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} aspects of the series that critics point out, either {{positively}} or negatively, is that the series [...] "never strays from its classic roots." [...] Unlike other modern, complex RPGs, Dragon Quest on the DS retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic. Points of contention are its battle system, comparatively simplistic storylines, general lack of character development, simplistic primitive-looking graphics (in earlier titles), and the overall difficulty of the game. These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various non-player characters the party meets. The stories avoid melodrama and feature relatively more simplistic characters than Final Fantasys Squall Leonhart or Tidus, a source of contention. There are exceptions, however, such as Dragon Quest V, which has been praised for its unique, emotional storytelling. Battles are also simple and finish quickly. As for difficulty, Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler. The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included {{with the intention of}} adding a sense of tension. Because of this added difficulty, the punishment for the party's death was toned down compared to other games by simply going back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> had last saved, with half of your gold on hand. When asked about criticism of Dragon Quest games, Horii says he does not mind, it means the critics played the game and he would rather know their concerns than remain ignorant.|$|E
