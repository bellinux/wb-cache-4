5|$|The most {{important}} festival to Athena in Athens was the Lesser Panathenaea, held annually, which {{was open to}} both sexes. Men and women were apparently not segregated during the procession leading the animals sacrificed to the altar, the festival's most religiously-significant part. Metics, both men and women, also had role in the Panathenaic procession, though it was subordinate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athenians. In the procession, young noble girls (kanephoroi) carried sacred baskets. The girls were required to be virgins; to prevent a candidate from being selected was, according to Pomeroy, to question her good name. The sister of Harmodius was reportedly rejected as a kanephoros by the sons of Peisistratos, precipitating his assassination of Hipparchus.|$|E
5|$|In December 1905, the Balfour {{government}} collapsed, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman became Prime Minister, {{leading a}} minority Liberal government. Richard Haldane was appointed Secretary of State for War, an almost accidental selectionhe {{himself had been}} aiming to be Lord Chancellor, whilst Campbell-Bannerman offered him the post of Attorney-General, then the Home Office, and had offered the War Office to two other men before Haldane offered to take it. Despite this inauspicious beginning, he would becomein the words of Douglas Haig"the greatest Secretary of State for War England has ever had". Haldane took the post with no preconceived ideas as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army, but quickly settled {{on the idea that}} efficiency was essential as a precursor to making financial economies. After a brief hiatus during the 1906 general election, which the Liberals won comfortably, Haldane {{turned his attention to the}} Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular Expeditionary Force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force.|$|E

25|$|Expression on {{instruments}} can {{be closely}} related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized {{is perhaps the}} realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} state’s narrative on {{the cause}} of the 21st July 1964 attributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UMNO and Malay newspaper Utusan Melayu for publishing anti-PAP headlines and instigating the Malays to demonstrate hatred towards the PAP. Utusan Melayu is the first Malay owned newspaper founded by Singapore’s first President Yusuf Ishak in 1939. Utusan Melayu which was controlled by UMNO was aim to “fight for religion, race and its homeland” placing key emphasis on the rights and the elevated status of the local Malays in Singapore. Utusan Melayu aroused anti-PAP sentiments among the local Malays by publishing and amplifying the Singapore government’s decision to evict the Malays from Crawford area for redevelopment of the urban spaces. This was seen as a violation of the Malay rights. The newspaper failed to report that in reality along the Malays, the Chinese were also evicted.|$|E

25|$|At the age {{of twenty}} Penley made his stage debut in 1871 at the Court Theatre, London as Tim, the porter, in a revival of John Maddison Morton's farce, My Wife's Second Floor. The {{following}} year he played in T. F. Plowman's burlesque Zampa at the Court, and performed at the Holborn Theatre in Hervé's operetta Doctor Faust. Among the cast of Zampa was Selina Dolaro, whose company Penley joined under the management of Richard D'Oyly Carte at the Royalty Theatre in London and on tour, in 1875. He played {{one of the two}} notaries in Offenbach's La Périchole, and was in the chorus of its companion piece, Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury. In November of that year he was promoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Foreman of the Jury in the latter work when it returned to the Royalty. He continued in the part when the opera played on another tour and in London, at the Opera Comique and the Royal Strand Theatre in 1876–77. Penley was considered to be an important addition in the small role, with his malleable comic features.|$|E
