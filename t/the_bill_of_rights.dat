40|$|State <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> preceded <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> From June 1776, {{when the}} Virginia Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> (<b>the</b> first state <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights)</b> was adopted, until December 1791, when <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> was ratified, eight states each adopted a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> as a {{separate}} part of their state constitution. State constitutional rights existed even before there as a United States Constitution. Furthermore, <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> contains provisions derived from earlier state <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> Indeed, virtually every guarantee in <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> {{can be traced to}} a similar guarantee in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> adopted in <b>the</b> states during the War of Independence or shortly thereafter. It is likely that the framers of the Constitution thought that the first bulwark of defense for the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> citizens would be state <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> One reason given at the 1787 Convention for not adding a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to <b>the</b> completed Constitution was that <b>the</b> state <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> remained undisturbed and were 2 ̆ 2 sufficient 2 ̆ 2 to protect against oppression by government...|$|R

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection of some of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> {{to state and local}} governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

50|$|Following World War II, {{there was}} a general {{movement}} in Canada to provide greater legislative protection for fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion. The first example was <b>the</b> Saskatchewan <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> 1947, <b>the</b> first <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> enacted in <b>the</b> British Commonwealth since <b>the</b> original English <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> 1688. <b>The</b> Saskatchewan <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> provided express statutory protection for the exercise of freedom of religion, in matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. Other provinces passed similar legislation, such as the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1962. The federal Parliament enacted <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> in 1963, which protected freedom of religion in matters coming within federal jurisdiction. The federal Parliament followed up by enacting the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1977, to prohibit discrimination {{on a wide range of}} personal characteristics, including protecting religion.|$|R
50|$|The Declaration, {{together}} with Magna Carta, <b>the</b> English <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> and <b>the</b> United States <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> inspired {{in large part}} the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> did not {{initially}} {{apply to the}} states, and federal criminal investigations were less common {{in the first century}} of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio (1961).|$|E
5|$|Black's most {{prominent}} ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II, who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955. They disagreed on several issues, including {{the applicability of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to the states, {{the scope of the}} due process clause, and the one man, one vote principle.|$|E
5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> but he did tie it exclusively to <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|McCarthyism {{declined}} in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy.

Board of Education, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{provisions}} of section 29 are plainly {{similar to those of}} the Sixth Amendment, namely the Information Clause, the Assistance of Counsel Clause, and the Compulsory Process Clause. The Sixth Amendment (and the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights)</b> had not yet been ratified at the time of the Crimes Act's passage.|$|E
5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} more {{significant}} source of criminal appeals in large part becauseas Barron v. Baltimore (1833) heldthe Bill of Rights (including its criminal procedure provisions) was viewed as inapplicable to the state governments.

5000|$|Shirley Wiegand, {{professor}} emeritus of law at Marquette University, asserts that <b>the</b> Library <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> uses rhetoric disconnected from the legal understanding of [...] "rights." [...] "Bills of Rights", and [...] "rights" [...] themselves, are in this understanding legally enforceable and backed by well-developed arguments. <b>The</b> Library <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> has no such force or backing, because {{it is simply a}} statement of principles. Wiegand argues that <b>the</b> Library <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> (and <b>the</b> accompanying rhetoric) needs to be supplanted by a code well-grounded in the case law and language of the First Amendment and its accompanying legal principles. Something similar to <b>the</b> Library <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> could be retained as an accompanying [...] "aspirational creed", such as a revised form of the ALA Code of Ethics, but it would need to provide more practical guidance.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> applicable to the states, as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements that state laws must satisfy.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Senate edited these {{amendments}} still further, making 26 {{changes of}} its own. Madison's proposal to apply parts of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> {{to the states}} as well as the federal government was eliminated, and the seventeen amendments were condensed to twelve, which were approved on September 9, 1789. The Senate also eliminated the last of Madison's proposed changes to the preamble.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} was greatly condensed by Congress, {{and passed the}} House and Senate with almost no recorded debate, complicating future discussion of the Amendment's intent. The First Amendment, {{along with the rest}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789, and adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E
