The influence of three ceramic fillers, granite, perlite and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), on the wear of the carbon fabric reinforced epoxy composites under dry sliding conditions has been investigated.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, scan test has {{turn out to be}} too {{expensive}} to implement for industry standard designs due to increasing test data volume and test time. The test cost of a chip is mainly governed by the resource utilization of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). Also, it directly depends upon test time that includes time required to load test program, to apply test vectors and to analyze generated test response of the chip. An issue of test time and data volume is increasingly appealing designers to use on-chip test data compactors, either on input side or output side or both. Such techniques significantly address the former issues but have little hold over increasing number of input-outputs under test mode. Further, <b>test</b> <b>pins</b> on DUT are increasing over the generations. Thus, scan channels on test floor are falling short in number for placement of such ICs. To address issues discussed above, we introduce an on-chip self-testing signature register. It comprises a response compactor and a comparator. The compactor compacts large chunk of response data to a small test signature whereas the comparator compares this test signature with desired one. The overall test result for the design is generated on single output pin. Being no storage of test response is demanded, the considerable reduction in ATE memory can be observed. Also, with only single pin to be monitored for test result, the number of tester channels and compare edges on ATE side significantly reduce {{at the end of the}} test. This cuts down maintenance and usage cost of test floor and increases its life time. Furthermore reduction in <b>test</b> <b>pins</b> gives scope for DFT engineers to increase number of scan chains so as to further reduce test time...|$|R

40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{and relentless}} {{growth in the}} electronics industry is feeding the demand for integrated circuits (ICs) with increasing functionality and performance at minimum cost and power consumption. As predicted by Moore's law, ICs are being aggressively scaled to meet this demand. While the continuous scaling of process technology is reducing gate delays, the performance of ICs is being increasingly dominated by interconnect delays. In an effort to improve submicrometer interconnect performance, to increase packing density, and to reduce chip area and power consumption, the semiconductor industry is focusing on three-dimensional (3 D) integration. However, volume production and commercial exploitation of 3 D integration are not feasible yet due to significant technical hurdles. At the present time, interposer-based 2. 5 D integration is emerging as a precursor to stacked 3 D integration. All the dies and the interposer in a 2. 5 D IC must be adequately tested for product qualification. However, since the structure of 2. 5 D ICs {{is different from the}} traditional 2 D ICs, new challenges have emerged: (1) pre-bond interposer testing, (2) lack of test access, (3) limited ability for at-speed testing, (4) high density I/O ports and interconnects, (5) reduced number of <b>test</b> <b>pins,</b> and (6) high power consumption. This research targets the above challenges and effective solutions have been developed to test both dies and the interposer. The dissertation first introduces the basic concepts of 3 D ICs and 2. 5 D ICs. Prior work on testing of 2. 5 D ICs is studied. An efficient method is presented to locate defects in a passive interposer before stacking. The proposed test architecture uses e-fuses that can be programmed to connect or disconnect functional paths inside the interposer. The concept of a die footprint is utilized for interconnect testing, and the overall assembly and test flow is described. Moreover, the concept of weighted critical area is defined and utilized to reduce test time. In order to fully determine the location of each e-fuse and the order of functional interconnects in a test path, we also present a test-path design algorithm. The proposed algorithm can generate all test paths for interconnect testing. In order to test for opens, shorts, and interconnect delay defects in the interposer, a test architecture is proposed that is fully compatible with the IEEE 1149. 1 standard and relies on an enhancement of the standard test access port (TAP) controller. To reduce test cost, a test-path design and scheduling technique is also presented that minimizes a composite cost function based on test time and the design-for-test (DfT) overhead in terms of additional through silicon vias (TSVs) and micro-bumps needed for test access. The locations of the dies on the interposer are taken into consideration {{in order to determine the}} order of dies in a test path. To address the scenario of high density of I/O ports and interconnects, an efficient built-in self-test (BIST) technique is presented that targets the dies and the interposer interconnects. The proposed BIST architecture can be enabled by the standard TAP controller in the IEEE 1149. 1 standard. The area overhead introduced by this BIST architecture is negligible; it includes two simple BIST controllers, a linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR), a multiple-input-signature-register (MISR), and some extensions to the boundary-scan cells in the dies on the interposer. With these extensions, all boundary-scan cells can be used for self-configuration and self-diagnosis during interconnect testing. To reduce the overall test cost, a test scheduling and optimization technique under power constraints is described. In order to accomplish testing with a small number <b>test</b> <b>pins,</b> the dissertation presents two efficient ExTest scheduling strategies that implements interconnect testing between tiles inside an system on chip (SoC) die on the interposer while satisfying the practical constraint that the number of required <b>test</b> <b>pins</b> cannot exceed the number of available pins at the chip level. The tiles in the SoC are divided into groups based on the manner in which they are interconnected. In order to minimize the test time, two optimization solutions are introduced. The first solution minimizes the number of input <b>test</b> <b>pins,</b> and the second solution minimizes the number output <b>test</b> <b>pins.</b> In addition, two subgroup configuration methods are further proposed to generate subgroups inside each test group. Finally, the dissertation presents a programmable method for shift-clock stagger assignment to reduce power supply noise during SoC die testing in 2. 5 D ICs. An SoC die in the 2. 5 D IC is typically composed of several blocks and two neighboring blocks that share the same power rails should not be toggled at the same time during shift. Therefore, the proposed programmable method does not assign the same stagger value to neighboring blocks. The positions of all blocks are first analyzed and the shared boundary length between blocks is then calculated. Based on the position relationships between the blocks, a mathematical model is presented to derive optimal result for small-to-medium sized problems. For larger designs, a heuristic algorithm is proposed and evaluated. In summary, the dissertation targets important design and optimization problems related to testing of interposer-based 2. 5 D ICs. The proposed research has led to theoretical insights, experiment results, and a set of test and design-for-test methods to make testing effective and feasible from a cost perspective.

The primary purpose of the well was to provide detailed geologic, hydrogeologic, chemical, and radionuclide data {{that can be used to}} test and build confidence in the applicability of the Frenchman Flat Corrective Action Unit flow and transport models for their intended purpose. In particular, this well was designed to provide data to evaluate the uncertainty in model forecasts of contaminant migration from the upgradient underground nuclear <b>test</b> <b>PIN</b> STRIPE, conducted in borehole U- 11 b in 1966. Well ER- 11 - 2 will provide information that can be used to refine the Phase II Frenchman Flat hydrostratigraphic framework model if necessary, as well as to support future groundwater flow and transport modeling. The main 31. 1 -centimeter (cm) hole was drilled to a total depth of 399. 6 meters (m). A completion casing string was not set in Well ER- 11 - 2. However, a piezometer string was installed in the 31. 1 -cm open hole. The piezometer is composed of 7. 3 -cm stainless-steel tubing hung on 6. 0 -cm carbon-steel tubing via a crossover sub. The piezometer string was landed at 394. 5 m, for monitoring the lower tuff confining unit. Data collected during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3. 0 m, various geophysical logs, water quality (including tritium and other test-related radionuclides) measurements, and water level measurements. The well penetrated 42. 7 m of Quaternary and Tertiary alluvium and 356. 9 m of Tertiary volcanic rock. The water-level measured in the piezometer string on September 25, 2012, was 353. 8 m below ground surface. No tritium above levels detectable by field methods were encountered in this hole. No well development or hydrologic testing was conducted in this well immediately after completion, and future well development, sampling, and hydrologic testing planned for this well will be limited due to the diameter of the piezometer string. The stratigraphy, general lithology, and the water level are as expected, but the section of geology encountered is higher than expected due to faulting.

40|$|Test {{generation}} {{procedures for}} large VLSI designs {{are required to}} achieve close to 100 % fault coverage using {{a small number of}} tests. They also must accommodate on-chip test compression circuits which are widely used in modern designs. To obtain test sets with small sizes one could use extra hardware such as test points or use software techniques. An important aspects impacting test generation is the number of specified positions, which facilitate the encoding of test cubes when using test compression logic. Fortuitous detection or generation of tests such that they facilitate detection of yet not targeted faults, is also an important goal for test generation procedures. At first, we consider the generation of compact test sets for designs using on-chip test compression logic. We introduce two new measures to guide automatic test generation procedures (ATPGs) to balance between these two contradictory requirements of fortuitous detection and number of specifications. One of the new measures is meant to facilitate detection of yet undetected faults, and the value of the measures is periodically updated. The second measure reduces the number of specified positions, which is crucial when using high compression. Additionally, we introduce a way to randomly choose between the two measures. We also propose an ATPG methodology tailored for BIST ready designs with X-bounding logic and test points. X-bounding and test points used to {{have a significant impact on}} test data compression by reducing the number of specified positions. We propose a new ATPG guidance mechanism that balances between reduced specifications in BIST ready designs, and also facilitates detection of undetected faults. We also found that compact test generation for BIST ready designs is influenced by the order in which faults are targeted, and we proposed a new fault ordering technique based on fault location in a FFR. Transition faults are difficult to test and often result in longer test lengths, we propose a new fault ordering technique based on test enumeration, this ordering technique and a new guidance approach was also proposed for transition faults. Test set sizes were reduced significantly for both stuck-at and transition fault models. In addition to reducing data volume, test time, and <b>test</b> <b>pin</b> counts, the test compression schemes have been used successfully to limit test power dissipation. Indisputably, toggling of scan cells in scan chains that are universally used to facilitate testing of industrial designs can consume much more power than a circuit is rated for. Balancing test set sizes against the power consumption in a given design is therefore a challenge. We propose a new Design for Test (DFT) scheme that deploys an on-chip power-aware test data decompressor, the corresponding test cube encoding method, and a compression-constrained ATPG that allows loading scan chains with patterns having low transition counts, while encoding a significant number of specified bits produced by ATPG in a compression-friendly manner. Moreover, the new scheme avoids periods of elevated toggling in scan chains and reduces scan unload switching activity due to unique test stimuli produced by the new technique, leading to a significantly reduced power envelope for the entire circuit under test...|$|E

All wire bonds were non-destructively pull tested prior to sealing. <b>Tests</b> included the <b>PIN</b> <b>test,</b> temperature cycling, and high temperature storage...|$|R

Data are presented for simulated mechanically fastened joint condi-tions in two laminate configurations ([0 /± 45 / 90] and [45 / 0 /- 45 / 02 /- 45 / 0 / 45 / 02 / 901) fabricated from Hercules AS/ 3501 - 6 graphite-epoxy. Strength and failure mode results are presented for the test temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F) 121 -C (250 °F) and 177 °C (350 °F) and {{for a range of}} the geometric parameters W/D and e/D from 3. 71 to 7. 43 and 1. 85 to 3. 69, respectively. A hole diameter, D of 5. 16 mm (0. 203 in.) was utilized for all <b>tests.</b> <b>Pin</b> bearing <b>tests</b> with out-ot-plane constraint were conducted at room temperature only. All elevated temperature data were generated for pi...|$|R
