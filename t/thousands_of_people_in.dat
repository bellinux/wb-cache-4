5|$|Throughout its path, Domoina left {{thousands}} of people homeless, and caused widespread flooding due to drawing moisture from the Indian Ocean and the Mozambique channel. The rains led to rivers bursting their banks, which isolated tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> the months before Domoina struck, dry conditions persisted across southeastern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into {{crowds of}} {{hundreds}} of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> cities across East Germany. The East German leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing {{the resignation of the}} hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E
5|$|With {{the central}} {{government}} collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance. In 858, enormous floods along the Grand Canal inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the North China Plain, which drowned tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} threatened {{large portions}} of the western coastline of Mexico, resulting in the evacuation of tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> coastal portions of western Mexico, strong winds downed trees, while heavy rain resulted in mudslides. Hurricane John caused moderate damage on the Baja California peninsula, including the destruction of more than 200houses and thousands of flimsy shacks. The hurricane killed five people in Mexico, and damage totaled $663million (2006MXN, $60.8million 2006USD). In the southwest United States, moisture from the remnants of John produced heavy rainfall. The rainfall aided drought conditions in portions of northern Texas, although it was detrimental in locations that had received above-normal rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} torrential rainfall {{throughout the}} islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities. As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated wind gusts of 155miles per hour (249km/h), which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area. The storm's severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired.|$|E
5|$|In Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards {{declared}} a state of emergency. About 1.25million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana, while approximately 60,000others fled parishes in southwest Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation from Grand Isle was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council. In New Orleans, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000residents in the low-lying areas of the city. Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top the levees, workers closed 111floodgates. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250members of the Louisiana National Guard patrolled the streets during the storm. The Red Cross assisted with opening a shelter at the University of Southwest Louisiana's Cajundome in Lafayette, equipped to handle about 2,000people.|$|E

5|$|In Kyushu, {{officials}} evacuated over {{a quarter}} of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan. These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the Arita district. In Miyazaki City, 21,483households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports. The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down. Canceled train services affected 77,800people on Shikoku. Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation for tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> addition, at least 723flights were cancelled because of the storm. Japan's second-largest refinery, Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries. About 700schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm. Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area.|$|E

Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, {{thousands}} of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, {{the first since}} Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cities}} along the North American and European route, the torch relay was protested by advocates of Tibetan independence, animal rights, and legal online gambling, and people protesting against China's human rights record, {{resulting}} in confrontations {{at a few}} of the relay locations. These protests, which ranged from <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco, to effectively none in Pyongyang, forced the path of the torch relay to be changed or shortened on a number of occasions. The torch was extinguished by Chinese security officials several times during the Paris leg for security reasons, and once in protest in Paris.|$|E
25|$|After the An Shi Rebellion (755–763), {{the economy}} of {{northern}} China was greatly damaged and never recovered due to wars and to constant flooding of the Yellow River.

Such an unfortunate event could reduce the legitimacy of a ruling dynasty by causing others to perceive it as having lost the Mandate of Heaven; this was a good reason for dynastic authorities to maintain a smooth and efficient canal system.|$|E
