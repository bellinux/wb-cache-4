40|$|Tobacco {{use will}} kill {{as many as}} 1 billion people in the 21 st century unless its use is curtailed. Smoking {{cessation}} is associated with several health and personal benefits; however, smoking cessation is difficult because of the highly addictive nature of nicotine. Successful smoking cessation strategies can generally {{be divided into two}} groups: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and behavioral modification. The National Cancer Institute in the US advocates the use of the There are several approved types of NRT. These include <b>nicotine</b> polacrilex gum, <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches,</b> <b>nicotine</b> lozenges, nicotine nasal sprays, nicotine inhalers, and nicotine lollipops. Nicotine polacrilex gum, <b>nicotine</b> <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches,</b> and <b>nicotine</b> lozenges are available both on prescription and over the counter. Nicotine nasal sprays and nicotine inhalers are available by prescription only, while nicotine lollipops are compounded by pharmacists. One of the drawbacks of these therapies is that they can be used in excess of recommended doses or durations of therapy. They are also all subject to the adverse effects of nicotine, which include dizziness, altered cardiac rhythms, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and muscle aches, and headache. Orally administered NRT is also associated with the additional adverse effects of sore throat, mouth sores, esophageal irritation, and stomach pain, while nicotine inhalers are associated with throat and airway irritation and coughing; nicotine nasal sprays are associated with a runny nose, sneezing, throat irritation, and coughing early in the course of treatment; and <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> are associated with skin irritation. More recently, other pharmacological treatments have been used for smoking cessation. Bupropion was developed as an antidepressant, but has been shown to reduce the desire to smoke. Bupropion may be used in combination with NRT and may also be helpful in reducing post-cessation weight gain. Varenicline is a specifically designed smoking cessation medication. It has been shown to greatly reduce both smoking withdrawal symptoms and the desire to smoke. However, varenicline has been associated with mood alteration that may be as severe as to include suicidality, gastrointestinal adverse effects, and sleep disturbances. Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies have been used in smoking cessation, with variable effects.

DESIGN [...] Randomised double blind placebo controlled parallel group study with one year of follow up. SETTING [...] 30 general practices in 15 English counties. SUBJECTS [...] 600 dependent heavy smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes daily) who were well motivated to give up. INTERVENTIONS [...] Brief general practitioner advice, booklet, and 16 hours per day patch treatment for 18 weeks with brief support and follow up at one, three, six, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Self reported complete abstinence for up to one year with biochemical validation at all follow up points. RESULTS [...] <b>Nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> reduced the severity of craving and adverse mood changes in the first weeks of withdrawal and doubled the rate of initial cessation at week 3 (nicotine group 36 % of patients (144 / 400), placebo group 16. 5 % of patients (33 / 200)) and of continuous abstinence throughout one year (nicotine group 9. 3 % (37), placebo group 5. 0 % (10)). A dose increase at week 1 among patients experiencing difficulty in quitting increased the proportion who achieved abstinence at week 3.

The authors compared the outcomes of two group psychotherapy programs for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were also treated with the <b>nicotine</b> <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> and with either atypical or typical antipsychotic medications. METHOD: Forty-five subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} 1) the group therapy program of the American Lung Association (N= 17) or 2) a specialized group therapy program for smokers with schizophrenia (N= 28) that emphasized motivational enhancement, relapse prevention, social skills training, and psychoeducation. All subjects participated in 10 weeks of treatment with the <b>nicotine</b> <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> (21 mg/day) and 10 weekly group therapy sessions and continued to receive their prestudy atypical (N= 18) or typical (N= 27) antipsychotic medications. Outcome variables included treatment retention, rate of smoking abstinence, and expired-breath carbon monoxide level. RESULTS: Smoking abstinence rates did not differ in the two group therapy programs. However, atypical antipsychotic agents, in combination with the <b>nicotine</b> <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch,</b> significantly enhanced the rate of smoking cessation (55. 6 % in the atypical agent group versus 22. 2 % in the typical group), which was reflected by a significant effect of atypical versus typical agents on carbon monoxide levels. Risperidone and olanzapine were associated with the highest quit rates. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 1) smoking cessation rates with the <b>nicotine</b> <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> are modest in schizophrenia, 2) specialized group therapy for schizophrenic patients is not significantly different from American Lung Association group therapy in its effect on smoking cessation, and 3) atypical agents may be superior to typical agents in combination with the <b>nicotine</b> <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> for smoking cessation in schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: The acute {{administration}} of nicotine via a cigarette {{has been demonstrated}} to enhance inspection time (IT), a measure of rapid visual information processing, while the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine impairs IT. However, as <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> provide a slow delivery of nicotine, it is unclear if they produce similar effects to nicotine administered by more rapid methods. OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the effects of}} <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> on inspection time. METHODS: Ten moderate smokers were administered nicotine (21 mg/day) or placebo via a transdermal patch in a randomized, double-blind, repeated measures design.

40|$|Background: Schizophrenia is a {{debilitating}} psychiatric disease {{that can cause}} many symptoms including attention deficits and cognitive impairments. Currently there are no effective treatments for the cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. There is a large population of smoking schizophrenics, which has pushed research to examine a possible correlation between nicotine and schizophrenia. Research has found that a possible cause for this correlation is self-medication: given that nicotine may enhance cognition. Research has now taken it one step further and examined the effect of nicotine administration on attention performance. Method: An exhaustive search using MEDLINE-PubMed, MEDLINE-Ovid, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was performed using the keywords: schizophrenia, nicotine, patch, and cognition. Eligibility criteria were applied to refine the search further. Articles were assessed for quality using GRADE criteria. Results: After completing the search, three articles were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies were RCTs and compared {{the effects of the}} <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patch</b> with schizophrenic participants versus controls. One study compared smoking participants, another compared non-smoking participants, and the last one compared both groups. All three studies support the hypothesis that nicotine improves the attention deficits in schizophrenia. The discussed studies focus on short-term effects of nicotine on attention performance, so future research should examine the long-term effects for safety and efficacy. Conclusion: Administration of a <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patch</b> has been shown to improve attention performance in schizophrenics. If further research validates these findings, usage of transdermal nicotine patches can be considered as an alternative therapy given the ease of use and availability.

40|$|Nicotinic {{mechanisms}} {{may play}} a role in the cognitive deficits of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). Recently, on a cognitively demanding strategy-based priming task, nicotine selectively affected controlled semantic processing in young adult non-smokers as reported by Holmes et al. (International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology 11, 389 - 399, 2008). Such controlled semantic processing is compromised in PD. This study investigated the effects of acute <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> on controlled semantic processing in nonsmokers with PD (n = 10) and non-smoking matched controls (n = 16) using a strategy-based semantic priming paradigm. <b>Transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> (7 mg/ 24 h) were administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.

Controls evidenced significant expectancy effects (i. e. reaction-time differences for expected vs. unexpected conditions) under both drug states. An expectancy effect was not evident for PD under placebo due to a lack of reaction-time slowing for unexpected conditions. However, under nicotine an expectancy effect was present for PD at a level comparable to controls.

40|$|Nicotine {{has been}} shown to improve various aspects of {{cognitive}} processing such as attention and memory, however, its effects on lexical-semantic processing are relatively uncharted. Recent investigations of mnemonic processing in minimally deprived smokers suggest that nicotine might selectively modulate processes concerned with associative memory. This study investigated the effects of nicotine on lexical-semantic processing in non-smokers using a strategy-based lexical-decision priming paradigm. <b>Transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> (7 mg/ 24 h) were administered within a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design.

In the present study, we hypothesized that spontaneous withdrawal resulting from removal of chronically implanted <b>transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> is regulated by the endocannabinoid system. A 7 -day nicotine dependence procedure (5. 2 mg/rat/day) elicited occurrence of reliable nicotine abstinence symptoms in Wistar rats. Somatic and affective withdrawal signs were observed at 16 and 34 hours following removal of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches,</b> respectively. Further behavioral manifestations including decrease in locomotor activity and increased weight gain also occurred during withdrawal. Expression of spontaneous nicotine withdrawal was accompanied by fluctuation in levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) in several brain structures including the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, levels of 2 - arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol were not significantly altered. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for the intracellular degradation of AEA, by URB 597 (0. 1 and 0. 3 mg/kg, i. p.), reduced withdrawalinduced anxiety as assessed by the elevated plus maze test and the shock-probe defensive burying paradigm, but did not prevent the occurrence of somatic signs. Together, {{the results indicate that}} pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing endocannabinoid signaling may offer therapeutic advantages to treat the negative affective state produced by nicotine withdrawal, which is critical for the maintenance of tobacco use...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Transdermal</b> <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> {{have been}} used in smoking {{cessation}} therapy, suggested for the treatment of skin disorders with eosinophilic infiltration and have been found to improve attention performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-associated memory impairment. However, skin irritation with extended patch use is still a problem. The aim of this work was to develop a simple to prepare liquid crystalline system containing vitamin E TPGS that would be able to control nicotine delivery and reduce irritation and sensitization problems. The liquid crystalline phases were macroscopically characterized by visual analysis and examined microscopically under a polarized light microscope. Topical and <b>transdermal</b> delivery of <b>nicotine</b> were investigated in vitro using porcine ear skin mounted on a Franz diffusion cell. Nicotine skin permeation from the developed cubic phase followed zero-order kinetics (r = 0. 993) and was significantly enhanced after 12 h when compared to the control formulation (nicotine solution) (p < 0. 05) (138. 86 ± 20. 44 and 64. 91 ± 4. 06 &# 956;g/cm 2, respectively). Cubic phase was also able to target viable skin layers in comparison to control solution (8. 18 ± 1. 89 and 2. 63 ± 2. 51 &# 956;g/cm 2, respectively). Further studies to evaluate skin sensitization and irritation are now necessary...|$|R
