40|$|Many <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> {{are being}} tremendously benefited from {{technological}} advances. For example, the Internet has increased communication skills and propaganda of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups,</b> since until then {{the only way}} to get publicity was to the attention of traditional media.

40|$|The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) {{contains}} many active and inactive <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups.</b> The {{defining characteristic of}} the <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> contained in the GTD is smallness. Unlike the modern business enterprise, for example, {{there appears to be}} no trend towards ‘bigness’. This paper presents an analysis of the size distribution of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and the implications of this size distribution for the technological conditions under which the output of terrorism may be increased. With net internal and external diseconomies to larger-scale production of terrorism, we should observe relatively small <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and little or no tendency for the number and size of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> in the ‘terrorism industry’ to increase. These facts do characterise the empirically observed size distribution of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups,</b> and imply that the technological conditions under which the output of terrorism may be increased are characterised by internal and external diseconomies to larger-scale production of terrorism. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{deterrence}} of terrorism. The {{aim is to}} assess validity of a proposition {{that it is possible}} to deter <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups,</b> but there are some specifics in comparison to the deterrence of states. First, we determine deterrence threats which can be applied in relation to <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and discuss possible restraints of their application in practice. This is followed by an analysis of whether deterrence can be applied against all types of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> without distinction, where we develop a model of classification of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> according to the goals which they pursue. So far, the topic of deterrence of terrorism has not been discussed in detail in the Czech academic texts. This article thus seeks to fill this lacuna and highlight the benefits of applying deterrence strategy to the <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|We examine who {{benefits}} {{when there}} is a strong leader in place, and those who benefit when a situation lacks a proper leader. There are fractious <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> who seek to serve the same people in a common cause against a common enemy. The groups compete for rents obtained from the public by engaging in actions against the common enemy. We derive a condition under which the concerned parties, the <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and the local population upon whom the <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> inflict their actions, benefit or lose in the two scenarios, and examine the consequences of counter-terrorist policy. all-pay auction; lottery; rent-seeking; terrorism...|$|R
50|$|Psychology also {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} how visual propaganda put forward by <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> contributes to their organization. In the book, “Psychology of Terrorism,” author Randy Borum argues that projecting an image of solidarity and power makes <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> more attractive as social collectives, even if the person joining the group does not at the outset believe in its ideology. A sense of belonging is one of the primary motivating factors for people joining <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups.</b> Many symbols cited by the Islamic Imagery Project and the International Terrorist Symbols Database reference this notion of community or belonging.|$|R

5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, {{such as the}} conflict between Israel and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened. Additionally, the veto applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes.

5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} New Order era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E
