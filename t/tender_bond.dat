40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that liberalizing international exchanges does not eliminate the risks involved in international trade. For indeed, parties to an international commercial transaction are often far distant from one another and naturally know little about their respective financial or industrial situations {{as well as the}} laws and customs in force in these countries. It is these circumstances that brought about various advance payment schemes such as the letters of credit. Yet world expansion of commerce that is largely due to hydro-electric projects and other projects linked together on a worldwide basis has given rise to contract guarantees. In this article the author deals with guarantees which mainly concern <b>tender</b> <b>bond,</b> performance bond, instalment reimbursement bond. By means of these guarantees, an importer may demand that a third party whose solvency is recognized will guarantee the economic bond of the exporter. The demand for supplying a contract guarantee may also be required by the international body that finances an economic project or by way of legislation in some countries. After having described the machinery of these guarantees, the author examines the legal nature and validity of them. He then analyses the legal relationship of parties to this institution. He concludes by considering different cases that may prevent the realisation of the guarantee...|$|E

We investigate the wealth effects to both bondholders and shareholders. Cash <b>tender</b> offers for <b>bonds</b> turn out to be value creating for firms; with bondholders taking most of the gains on a relative basis. We find no evidence of wealth transfers from shareholders to bondholders: bondholders are paid an average tender premium of 3. 9 % but shareholders do not experience a significant wealth loss. Shareholders even benefit from making refinancing <b>bond</b> <b>tender</b> offers after a drop in interest rates. The wealth effects to both bondholders and shareholders increase in the remaining time to maturity. This suggests that <b>tendering</b> the <b>bonds,</b> rather than waiting for them to mature, is a win-win situation for both types of security holders. <b>Bonds</b> <b>Tender</b> offers Repurchases Financial restructuring...|$|R

Harper Collins released a slightly altered {{version of the}} book in 2008 without that subtitle. Herendeen's atypical Regency Romance introduces a central same-sex love story into a Regency-set tale of a marriage of convenience which otherwise obeys many of the conventions of genre romance. The heroine Phyllida, an author(ess), offers the hero {{a quid pro quo}} of [...] "irregular" [...] liberty in marriage - his sexual freedom for her literary and professional freedom. The novel delivers the generically required account of the development of the couple's erotic and <b>tender</b> <b>bonds</b> through trials to deep and permanent commitment, while Phyllida's authorship supplies Herendeen's text with a common metafictional feature of postmodern genre romance: a novel-within-the-novel, exploring forbidden sexuality in the fashionable manner of the era. Passages of Phyllida's fiction are rendered as pastiches of the great Gothic tradition (e.g. Charles Maturin, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew [...] "Monk" [...] Lewis, Clara Reeve, Mary Shelley) the language and conventions of which are at once mocked and relished.|$|R

40|$|In a {{frictionless}} {{market with}} perfect information, a shareholder-wealth- maximizing firm should force conversion of its convertible bond issue into stock {{as soon as}} the bond comes in-the-money. Firms however appear to systematically delay forced conversion, sometimes for years, beyond this time. We show that the observed delays can be plausibly explained in terms of costs to shareholders of a failed conversion and the ensuing financial distress. Firms delay the forced conversion to avoid the self-fulfilling outcome that bondholders expect the conversion to fail, <b>tender</b> their <b>bonds</b> for cash, and the stock price falls to account for the costs of financial distress, in which case tendering for cash is in fact optimal. Unlike other explanations of delayed forced conversion, we can explain the common use of investment banks to underwrite these transactions, since the banks can eliminate the self-fulfilling bad outcome. ...|$|R

6000|$|For all his misfortunes, {{he was not}} cast down. He {{had that}} {{lightness}} of temper which seems proper to most northern Italians, whereas those from the south are usually dark-mooded, sad-faced men. Nothing surpasses for unstudied misanthropy of expression the visages of different Neapolitan harpers who have visited us; but they have some right to their dejected countenances as being of a yet half-civilized stock, and as real artists and men of genius. Nearly all wandering violinists, as well as harpers, are of their race, and they are of every age, from that of mere children to men in their prime. They are very rarely old, {{as many of the}} organ- grinders are; they are not so handsome as the Italians of the north, though they have invariably fine eyes. They arrive in twos and threes; the violinist briefly tunes his fiddle, and the harper unslings his instrument, and, with faces of profound gloom, they go through their repertory,--pieces from the great composers, airs from the opera, not unmingled with such efforts of Anglo-Saxon genius as Champagne Charley and Captain Jenks of the Horse Marines, which, like the language of Shakespeare and Milton, hold us and our English cousins in <b>tender</b> <b>bonds</b> of mutual affection. Beyond the fact that they come [...] "dal Basilicat'," [...] or [...] "dal Principat'," [...] one gets very little out of these Neapolitans, though I dare say they are not so surly at heart as they look. Money does not brighten them to the eye, but yet it touches them, and they are good in playing or leaving off to him that pays. Long time two of them stood between the gateway firs on a pleasant summer's afternoon and twanged and scraped their harmonious strings, till all the idle boys of the neighborhood gathered about them, listening with a grave and still delight. It was a most serious company: the Neapolitans, with their cloudy brows, rapt in their music; and the Yankee children, with their impassive faces, warily guarding against the faintest expression of enjoyment; and when at last the minstrels played a brisk measure, and the music began to work in the blood of the boys, and one of them shuffling his reluctant feet upon the gravel, broke into a sudden and resistless dance, the spectacle became too sad for contemplation. The boy danced only from the hips down; no expression of his face gave the levity sanction, nor did any of his comrades: they beheld him with a silent fascination, but none was infected by the solemn indecorum; and when the legs and music ceased their play together, no comment was made, and the dancer turned unheated away. A chance passer asked for what he called the Gearybaldeye Hymn, but the Neapolitans apparently did not know what this was.|$|R

Our clinical analysis provides support for the explanatory power of our model. Calibrating the predictions of the model with data from these STACs, we demonstrate a correspondence between theory and actual corporate behavior.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{provides}} a theoretical and clinical analysis of <b>bond</b> <b>tender</b> offers {{accompanied by a}} threat to call nontendered <b>bonds,</b> “Simultaneous <b>Tender</b> and Call ” or STAC offers. First, we demonstrate that the viability of STAC offers depends crucially on (a) {{the credibility of the}} call threat (subgame perfection), (b) the ability of the bondholders of public debt issues to coordinate their actions to maximize their collective payoff (coalitionproofness), and (c) the magnitude of the cost of deviation from optimal capital structure (capital structure relevance). Next, the three cases of actual STACs for which public information is available—James River, May Department Stores, and Houston Lighting & Power Company—are investigated. A correspondence is established between conclusions of the theoretical analysis and the outcomes of these three STAC offers. We found that, after some learning, bondholders coordinated to strategies involving resistance to call threats that were not credible, i. e., call strategies that involved threats to call that were not in the ex post interest of shareholders. The credibility of shareholder call threats, in turn, depended on the magnitude of the deviation from the firm’s optimal capital structure required to fund the call with new equity...|$|R

Chapter three begins with an observation that critics fail to consider how dominant attitudes about race and gender shaped Whitman's representations. Another aspect of his Leaves of Grass that has eluded attention is the prevalence of California in his work. As I argue, Whitman's references to California in his own "Blue Book" copy of the 1860 edition suggest his desire for a racially and sexually homogeneous gay nation. Herman Melville's Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War is the focus of my final chapter. In this poetry he underscores that the homosocial martial life of war provided American men with an opportunity to forge fraternal intimacy with one another. Seeking to memorialize the sacrifices of Union soldiers, Melville sentimentalizes their losses so much that his poetry comes across as a homoerotic epic. Melville in Battle-Pieces offers a model of fraternity in which men eroticize racial and gender sameness...|$|R
