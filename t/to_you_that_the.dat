He called the march [...] "one of the greatest demonstrations of faith this great city has ever seen." [...] Brown said that [...] "at our current rates of progress," [...] the MDGs will not be met by the 2015 deadline. He told the Anglican Communion bishops, [...] "I say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poor {{of the world have}} been patient but 100 years is too long for people to wait for justice and that is why we must act now." [...] The full speech can be read at ...|$|E

"Padre Pio {{looked at}} Lefebvre very sternly and said: [...] "Never cause discord among your {{brothers}} and always practise {{the rule of}} obedience; above all when it seems <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> errors of those in authority are all the more serious. There is no other road than that of obedience, especially {{for those of us}} who have made this vow."... It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio looked at him intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it! You will tear apart the community of faithful, oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "The Great Depression" [...] is most {{frequently}} attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins, whose 1934 book The Great Depression {{is credited with}} formalizing the phrase, though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term, informally referring to the downturn as a depression, with such uses as [...] "Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement" [...] (December 1930, Message to Congress), and [...] "I need not recount <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is passing through a great depression" [...] (1931).|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Valenti became notorious for his {{flamboyant}} {{attacks on the}} Sony Betamax Video Cassette Recorder (VCR), which the MPAA feared would devastate the movie industry. He famously told a congressional panel in 1982, [...] "I say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone." [...] Despite Valenti's prediction, the home video market ultimately came to be the mainstay of movie studio revenues throughout the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
