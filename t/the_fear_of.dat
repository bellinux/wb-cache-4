5|$|From 1950 onward, McCarthy {{continued}} to exploit <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Communism and to press his accusations {{that the government}} was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. McCarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets. These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> defamation suits.|$|E

5|$|Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was {{the founder}} and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart {{believed}} that jealousy, materialism, and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing another's love were {{at the root of}} much of the illness in the world. Under his direction, the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E

Sean works as a police deputy, and is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy a few days before Christmas. A great white shark attacks and kills him, sinking his boat in the process.|$|E

5|$|Projected as a {{potential}} draft pick in the first eight rounds of the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, Gattis instead intimated {{that he intended to}} attend college and play college baseball.

However, the divorce of his parents and anxiety derived from <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failing at college baseball led Gattis to abuse alcohol and marijuana.

5|$|Slow {{progress}} in preventing the disease may in part {{be due to}} stigma associated with TB. Stigma {{may be due to}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> transmission from affected individuals.

Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> 'enthusiasm'.|$|E

The military intelligence organisations initially sought a non-military annexation strategy, intending to use APODETI as its integration vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} further {{developed}} into {{the plot of}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> company downsizing, along {{with the introduction of}} new characters and developing some of the minor ones—especially that of Dwight. As Michael starts a relationship with his boss Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin), Pam and Jim’s relationship become one of the focal points of the season. Their compatibility becomes more obvious as Jim’s feelings for Pam continue to grow, while she struggles with her relationship with the warehouse worker Roy Anderson (David Denman).|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E

Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case of}} EVs, to avoid <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, matches at heavily {{attended}} grounds {{were initially}} prohibited due to <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe. Scottish national league and cup competitions were suspended {{for the duration}} of the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their place. Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was the maximum permitted. The Parashots, a forerunner of the Home Guard, set up a command post at Lesser Hampden in 1940. A government official presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches be ploughed and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen's Park committee chose to ignore the order and the government did not pursue it. Wartime internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5–4 on 18 April 1942.|$|E
