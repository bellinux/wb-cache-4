40|$|This paper {{examines}} the operational {{limitations of the}} Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) as a regional financial safety net in East Asia and presents a new regional financial arrangement. To overcome the drawbacks of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization which has never been activated so far, this study proposes that ASEAN+ 3 establish a new lending facility, so-called a Reserve Fund Facility, and create a regional common reserves asset. The proposed Reserve Fund Facility framework guarantees lending automaticity of <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>facility,</b> based on upfront funding instead of pledge funding. Establishing the Reserve Fund Facility {{could find a way}} of making up for weakness of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization and responding to the regional needs for effective regional financial arrangement. The full-fledged Reserve Fund Facility will ultimately contribute to the future development of East Asia's monetary and financial cooperation beyond the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a small open economy model {{to analyze the}} role of central bank liquidity management in implementing “unconventional” monetary policies within an inflation targeting framework. In particular, the paper explicitly models the facilities that the central bank uses to manage <b>liquidity</b> in <b>the</b> economy, which creates a role for the central bank balance sheet in equilibrium. This permits the analysis of two “unconventional” policies: sterilized exchange-rate interventions and expanding the list of eligible collaterals accepted at <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> operated by <b>the</b> central bank. These policies have been recently implemented by several central banks: the former {{as a way to}} counteract persistent appreciations in the domestic currency, and the latter {{as a response to the}} recent global financial crisis in 2008.

30|$|Post-disaster micro-credit is {{not without}} its risks as, {{increased}} post-disaster demand can challenge <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of micro-credit organizations and lead to relaxed loan conditions or even debt pardoning. To deal with this problem, development organizations and private investors in Latin America have created a novel intermediary institution, <b>the</b> Emergency <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Facility,</b> which acts as a lender of last resort by providing needed and immediate post-disaster liquidity to MFIs (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 2012). Governments also borrow to finance their post-disaster liabilities, but generally after they have exploited all available sources from their budgets. In developing countries, funds are often diverted from projects funded by loans from the World Bank and other lending agencies. Whereas this response may be the least costly for a government, it can be disruptive both economically and politically. Most countries require that budget reallocations obtain parliamentary approval, which can delay the appropriation of funding.|$|R

40|$|As markets deepen and {{interest}} elasticities increase it is optimal for emerging markets to shift towards {{an interest rate}} instrument since continuing monetization of the economy implies money demand shocks are large.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the market-based {{financial}} system since the mid- 1980 s {{changed the nature of}} financial intermediation in the United States profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, "shadow banks" are particularly important institutions. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose finance companies, structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored enterprises.; Shadow banks are interconnected along a vertically integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and repo. This intermediation chain binds shadow banks into a network, which is the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system rivals the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. Over the past decade, the shadow banking system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless short-term liabilities. Maturity and credit transformation in the shadow banking system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial crisis.; We document that the shadow banking system became severely strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional banks, shadow banks conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation, but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access to public sources of <b>liquidity,</b> such as <b>the</b> Federal Reserve's discount window, or public sources of insurance, such as federal deposit insurance. <b>The</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> of <b>the</b> Federal Reserve and other government agencies' guarantee schemes were a direct response to <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> and capital shortfalls of shadow banks and, effectively, provided either a backstop to credit intermediation by the shadow banking system or to traditional banks for the exposure to shadow banks. Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.

I develop a no-arbitrage based affine term structure model with default risk and conduct a thorough factor analysis of the counterparty default risk among major financial institutions and the underlying mortgage default risk. The new facilities' effectiveness is examined, by first separately examining their effects in relieving financial institutions' liquidity concerns and reducing the counterparty risk premiums, and then quantifying their overall effects in reducing financial strains in the inter-bank money market.; Empirical results indicate that the Term Auction Facility (TAF) has a strong effect in reducing financial strains in the inter-bank money market, primarily through relieving financial institutions' liquidity concerns. Heightened uncertainty regarding the macroeconomy, financial markets, and mortgage default risk have significantly raised counterparty risk premiums among financial institutions, but have had little effect on their <b>liquidity</b> premiums. <b>The</b> Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), however, are found to have had less discernible effects so far in relieving financial strains in the Libor market.
