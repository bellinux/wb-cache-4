5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing.</b> Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> and settling {{under the weight}} of the particles. <b>Turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E
25|$|With cooling towers, a {{hyperbolic}} {{structure is}} preferred. At the bottom, the widening {{of the tower}} provides a large area for installation of fill to promote thin film evaporative cooling of the circulated water. As the water first evaporates and rises, the narrowing effect helps accelerate the laminar flow, and then as it widens out, contact between the heated air and atmospheric air supports <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing.</b>|$|E

Such capsules have received little interest {{because it was}} assumed that hydrodynamic instabilities would forestall ignition. The authors used a K-L <b>turbulent</b> <b>mix</b> model, integrated into a hydro code, to evaluate a series of double shell implosions. The double shell implosions were laser-driven experiments performed at the OMEGA laser. They briefly review the <b>turbulent</b> <b>mix</b> model. The model has adjustable parameters for the growth and dissipation terms. These are initially set by comparison to classical experiments. The model also requires an initial length scale and an initial wavelength scale. Next the authors briefly describe the experiment. The target assembly consists of an inner shell of glass and an outer shell of brominated plastic. They present the analysis of the hydrodynamic implosion, using the <b>turbulent</b> <b>mix</b> model. The agreement between experiment and calculation suggests that the model could be successfully applied to ignition targets...|$|R

It has been found that the new hybrid multifluid <b>turbulent</b> <b>mix</b> model has all real characteristics if either real or turbulent viscosity is present. When real viscosity vanishes, the model still has all real characteristics for zero relative motion between fluids. For nonzero relative motions between fluids, the model will have all real characteristics if the disordered motions and turbulent viscosity together are generated with the nonzero relative motions simultaneously. The implications of the results are further discussed...|$|R

Wash load concentrations are approximately uniform in the water column. This is described by the endmember case in which the Rouse number is equal to 0 (i.e. the settling velocity is far less than the <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> velocity), which leads to a prediction of a perfectly uniform vertical concentration profile of material.|$|E
25|$|As had {{happened}} with the earlier Shiva, Nova failed to meet expectations in terms of fusion output. The maximum fusion yield on NOVA was about 1013 neutrons per shot. In this case the problem was tracked to instabilities that caused <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> of the fuel during collapse and upset the formation and transmission of the shock wave. The problem was caused by Nova's inability to closely match the output energy {{of each of the}} beamlines, which meant that different areas of the pellet received different amounts of heating across its surface. This led to hot spots on the pellet which were imprinted into the imploding plasma, seeding Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities and thereby mixing the plasma so the center did not collapse uniformly.|$|E
25|$|From a {{study in}} 1991, the tritium profile {{was used as a}} tool for {{studying}} the mixing and spreading of newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), corresponding to tritium increases to 4TU. This NADW tends to spill over sills that divide the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic Ocean and then flows to the west and equatorward in deep boundary currents. This process was explained via the large-scale tritium distribution in the deep North Atlantic between 1981 and 1983. The sub-polar gyre tends to be freshened (ventilated) by the NADW and {{is directly related to the}} high tritium values (>1.5TU). Also evident was the decrease in tritium in the deep western boundary current by a factor of 10 from the Labrador Sea to the Tropics, which is indicative of loss to ocean interior due to <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> and recirculation.|$|E

Since the agreement of the LES results to data in the literature was poor, we performed additional DNS to identify possible errors source in the used algorithms and the discretization scheme.

25|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a {{hydraulic}} jump which {{occurs when the}} incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|E

2500|$|Net {{photosynthesis}} in {{the water}} column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer. [...] <b>Turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> by wind energy at the ocean's surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates (creating the aforementioned mixed layer). [...] The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it. [...] The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone, to being much deeper than the photic zone. [...] When it is much deeper than the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur. [...] The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth. [...] As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth.|$|E
2500|$|Diatoms {{belong to}} a large group called the heterokonts, {{including}} both autotrophs (e.g., golden algae, kelp) and heterotrophs (e.g., water moulds). Their yellowish-brown chloroplasts are typical of heterokonts, having four membranes and containing pigments such as the carotenoid fucoxanthin. Individuals usually lack flagella, but they are present in male gametes of the centric diatoms and have the usual heterokont structure, except they lack the hairs (mastigonemes) characteristic in other groups. Most diatoms are nonmotile, as their relatively dense cell walls cause them to readily sink. Planktonic forms in open water usually rely on <b>turbulent</b> <b>mixing</b> of the upper layers by the wind to keep them suspended in sunlit surface waters. It was once assumed that species actively regulate their buoyancy via intracellular lipids to counter sinking. However, {{there is no direct}} evidence for this hypothesis.
