A study of school-wide implementation of classroom meetings in a lower-income Sacramento, CA elementary school over a four-year period showed that suspensions decreased (from 64 annually to 4 annually), vandalism decreased (from 24 episodes to 2) and teachers reported improvement in classroom atmosphere, behavior, attitudes and academic performance. (Platt, 1979) A study of parent and teacher education programs directed at parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> [...] "maladaptive" [...] behavior that implemented Positive Discipline tools showed a statistically significant improvement in the behavior of students in the program schools when compared to control schools. (Nelsen, 1979) Smaller studies examining the effects of specific Positive Discipline tools have also shown positive results. (Browning, 2000; Potter, 1999; Esquivel) Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that a student’s perception of being part of the school community (being [...] "connected" [...] to school) decreases the incidence of socially risky behavior (such as emotional distress and suicidal thoughts / attempts, cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use; violent behavior) and increases academic performance. (Resnick et al., 1997; Battistich, 1999; Goodenow, 1993) There is also significant evidence that teaching younger students social skills has a protective effect that lasts into adolescence. Students that have been taught social skills are more likely to succeed in school and less likely to engage in problem behaviors. (Kellam et al., 1998; Battistich, 1999) ...|$|E

The evaluation of special education teachers involves many unique challenges which are especially apparent when evaluating <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> lowincidence disabilities.

The small-scale study aimed to capture the scope {{and complexity of the}} activities of these teachers and the regular challenges they face in their expected everyday roles. Methods: Telephone interviews were used to collect descriptive data from the teachers. A direct field-sampling procedure was used across the governmental schools to recruit qualified and specialist teachers who met prespecified criteria, most of whom lived in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city. The content of the interviews was generated from two sequenced activities with a different group of experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> visual impairments. Results: The teachers carried out complex and demanding duties as part of their everyday roles. These duties were consistent with those performed by their counterparts around the world. The most frequently performed and most important activities including providing direct support to students, advocating for students' needs, and collaborating across school and community contexts. The identified challenges were linked primarily to the lack of time to undertake important activities. Discussion: Three important and interconnected findings can be drawn from the results: role complexity, time and collaboration, and the importance of the expanded core curriculum. Implications for Practitioners: The findings provide an initial snapshot of the changing role reported by the teachers. Thus, these data offer a beginning point for future probes into the workplace knowledge and skills required by <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> visual impairments.

40|$|Abstract: Today’s {{teacher has}} many responsibilities, {{including}} that of a reading literacy teacher, which {{are affected by the}} rising number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs being served in an inclusive classroom setting along <b>with</b> non-disabled <b>students.</b> Educational professionals are charged by law to make accommodations to education to allow all students access to the educational situation. One method of accommodation to education is through the use of technology. The literature circle is a cooperative activity involving higher level thinking that is being used to support literacy learning. Technology can be used to accommodate <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs in a literature circle by providing accommodations to student interactions, reading material, and role activities and assignments. Today’s teacher is not only a subject area teacher, but also a reading teacher, a technology teacher, and a <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special needs. Today, every teacher is now a reading teacher, because every teacher is responsible for promoting literacy in his/her content area. Teachers are also expected to teach their students to use higher level and critical thinking skills and are required to make accommodations for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> special need in their class, an occurrence that has become more common in today’s schools. The literature circle is an ideal literacy activity for practice in higher level thinking in a collaborative environment. By integrating technology into literature circle activities, teachers can provide enhancements for all students and accommodations for students who need them...|$|R
