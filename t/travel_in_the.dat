5|$|After World War II, and the {{building}} of the Interstate Highway System beginning in 1956, automobile ownership and travel became a preferred mode of <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.

5|$|Live and Let Die is {{the second}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series of stories, and is set in London, the US and Jamaica. It was first {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1954. Fleming wrote the novel at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica before his first book, Casino Royale, was published; much of the background came from Fleming's <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and knowledge of Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{set sail}} from London on his ship Endurance, {{bound for the}} Weddell Sea in August 1914. Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party {{personnel}} gathered in Australia, prior to departure for the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship, SY Aurora. Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914, which shortened their first depot-laying season. After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic <b>travel,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process losing most of their sled dogs.|$|E
5|$|Space Travel is {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.|$|E

5|$|The Somerset Levels—specifically dry {{points at}} Glastonbury and Brent Knoll— {{also have a}} long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by Mesolithic hunters. <b>Travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area was {{facilitated}} by the construction of one of the world's oldest known engineered roadways, the Sweet Track, which dates from 3807 BC or 3806 BC.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued {{to experiment with}} equipment and techniques, altering the designs of skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic <b>travel.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E
5|$|With railroads {{becoming}} the dominant form of long-range shipping and passenger <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1870s, riverboats {{like those in}} Omaha became obsolete.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 18th century, very few of the selected delegates were present on the designated day of May 14, 1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured. (New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.) James Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation produced the Virginia Plan, which was designed and written by James Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E

5|$|Seven of {{the lines}} are {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can <b>travel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets.
