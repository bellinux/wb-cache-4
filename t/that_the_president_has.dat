25|$|Whether the President may speak {{publicly}} {{on issues}} without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the 2011 presidential election. While some candidates {{and members of}} the public suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> power to do so, the Law Minister, K.Shanmugam, stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. A difference of opinion also exists over whether the President exercises soft power.|$|E

Like the majority of Americans, I support the Defense of Marriage Act and find it appalling that the Obama administration decided not to defend this federal law which was enacted with broad bipartisan support and {{signed into law by}} a Democrat president. It’s appalling, but not surprising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> flip-flopped on yet another issue from his stated position as a candidate to a seemingly opposite position once he was elected." ...|$|E
