5|$|By {{chance he}} then runs into another man his age, {{the far more}} {{spontaneous}} Trygve Sissener, who has fallen asleep in the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never had the courage <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> sport. He now feels {{as if he has}} let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{at the age}} of seven, {{shortly before}} Knight lost the {{majority}} of her sight, she had been to France on a skiing holiday and was encouraged <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> sport by her mother. Her mother was Knight's first sighted guide until late January 2013 for financial reasons. The pair competed together in visually impaired (VI) races.|$|E

5|$|Somerset Vikings are a Rugby League Club {{who were}} formed at the {{beginning}} of 2003 as part of the Rugby Football League's plans to develop the game further beyond the traditional areas in the north of England. Initially the side was made up of a mixture of Royal Marines based in Taunton and Exeter together with a number of local rugby union players keen <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> 13-man code. The Vikings play at Hyde Park which is the home of the Taunton R.F.C., a rugby union club, which was formed in 1875.|$|E
5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, who is about <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile {{with a bag of}} donated blood in his coat pocket.|$|E
50|$|Northumberland {{would prove}} to be one of Charles I's {{greatest}} supporters in the Rump Parliament.

5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched {{to in the}} previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly {{the same amount of}} time as Dawn of Sorrow did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{presented}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers showed off a demonstration of the game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E
5|$|Edward Christian, {{brother of}} Fletcher Christian, had been {{appointed}} Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely in 1800 by the Bishop of Ely. As the Chief Justice, Christian was entitled <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> rioters alone. The government, in this case via the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, nevertheless appointed a Special Commission, consisting of Justice Abbott and Justice Burrough. The rioters were tried in the assizes at Ely during the week commencing June 1816. 23 men and one woman were condemned, of which five were subsequently hanged. General unrest and riots such as that at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824 and subsequently the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829.|$|E
50|$|In 1864, the Rhenish Railway Company began {{construction}} of the Eifel line from Düren via Euskirchen and Gerolstein <b>to</b> <b>Trier.</b> <b>The</b> section from Düren to Euskirchen {{is now known as}} the Börde Railway (Bördebahn).|$|R

5|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmiths {{gameplay}} {{is structured}} similarly to the gameplay {{of the other}} games in the series, in which players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate the playing of rock music, hitting fret buttons and strumming in time to notes as they scroll on the screen. The player's performance is tracked through each song; if the player does well they are given a score and a rating of up to five stars; if the player performs poorly, the song may end prematurely and the player will need <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> song again. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties that changes the number and speed of the notes that must be played.|$|E
5|$|In October 1885, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company {{built the}} first {{sulphide}} pulp mill in Canada, {{which at the time}} was the Dominion of Canada, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. He decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> sulphite method out for himself {{at the head of the}} East River. He had 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares, or 242km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to his seat in Congress in the late fall of 1812. Based on his experience, he proposed a plan to defeat the mobile, guerrilla warfare of the Indians. American troops moved slowly, dependent on a supply line. Indians would evade battle and raid supplies until the American forces withdrew or were overrun. Mounted riflemen could move quickly, carry their own supplies, and live off the woods. If they attacked Indian villages in winter, the Indians would be compelled to stand and fight for the supplies they used to wage war, and could be decisively defeated. Johnson submitted this plan to President James Madison and Secretary of War John Armstrong, who approved it in principle. They referred the plan to Harrison, who found winter operations impracticable. Johnson was permitted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> tactics {{in the summer of}} 1813; later the US conducted Indian wars in winter with his strategy.|$|E

5|$|Mystery of the Emblem began {{development}} in 1992 during {{the production of}} Fire Emblem Gaiden. The staff from previous entries, including series creator Shouzou Kaga and composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, returned to their respective roles. While originally conceived as two separate projects, the team eventually merged the proposed remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light with the original story content of Mystery of the Emblem. The gameplay, which had veered away from the first game's tactical RPG routes in Gaiden, returned to its more traditional stance. The difficulty was lowered to encourage new players <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, October 6, {{the grand}} jury heard {{testimony}} from Joseph Langdon, {{the crew of the}} Lucinda, and a carman from Brooklyn. At 9am, {{the grand jury}} presented five bills of indictment against Jackalow: the murder of Jonathan Leete; the murder of Elijah Leete; the robbery of Jonathan Leete; the robbery of Elijah Leete; and running away with the Spray. Voorhees was joined by lawyer Isaac R. Wilson, of New York City, for Jackalow's defense. Jackalow pleaded not guilty to each count. On the motion of U.S. Attorney Cannon, a special term of the circuit court was appointed to meet in Trenton, on the third Tuesday in January, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E
5|$|The Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia was {{the site}} of women's {{skeleton}} at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada. The track was constructed between 2005 and 2008, and became only the 15th competition-level track in the world. It was certified for competition in sliding sports by the International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in March, 2008 in a process called homologation where hundreds of athletes ran the track. This was the first time many competitors at the 2010 Games were able <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> track and begin to develop strategies for it. Canadian athletes hoped that having it open two years before the Games, and having that amount of time to train on it, would give them an advantage in the Games. The Whistler Sliding Centre quickly gained {{a reputation as one of}} the fastest tracks in the world.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It {{had flown}} a scheduled route to Kjeller, {{and the captain}} had continued to Fornebu <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> new airport. On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made a mistake, and took off from the parking space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished. With In Re Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> fuses {{for a couple}} of months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E
