500|$|Badler had {{a four-month}} guest {{contract}} with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010. Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she [...] "could not get it together". She said [...] "I noticed {{a few of the}} other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely. I was contracted for four months and the way that it ended is very {{up in the air and}} I'm sure that they will use me whenever they need <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> a bit, you know".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E

50|$|Down 2-0 in {{the series}} but heading home <b>to</b> FleetCenter, Boston <b>shook</b> <b>things</b> <b>up,</b> {{replacing}} Steve Shields, who allowed six goals {{in the first two}} games, in favor of Jeff Hackett. The shakeup did not do much, as the Devils shut out in the Bruins in Game 3, 3-0, with goalie Martin Brodeur stopping all 29 shots he faced. Not wanting to end their season with a winless postseason and a loss in front of their fans, Boston came out firing in Game 4, winning the game, 5-1, and knocking out Brodeur after the fifth goal in favor of Corey Schwab, who went six-for-six in net.|$|R
500|$|Scott Foundas of Variety {{was less}} {{impressed}} with the film, describing it as [...] "formulaic", though he praised its voice acting and technical artistry: [...] "The tactile, snow-capped Arendelle landscape, including Elsa's ice-castle retreat is Frozens other true marvel, enhanced by 3D and the decision to shoot in widescreen– {{a nod to the}} CinemaScope richness of Sleeping Beauty and Lady and the Tramp... That's almost but not quite enough {{to make up for the}} somewhat slack plotting and the generic nature of the main characters. Neither princess here is a patch on Tangleds babe-in-the-woods Rapunzel, while both Hans and Kristoff are cut from pretty standard-issue hero cloth until a reasonably surprising third-act twist somewhat ups the ante. Only Olaf is unimpeachable: Get this snowman a spinoff feature to call his own." [...] The Seattle Times gave the film two out of four stars, stating that [...] "While it is an often gorgeous film with computer-generated fjords and ice sculptures and castle interiors, the important thing that glues all this stuff together– story– is sadly lacking." [...] Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also criticized the story as the film's weakest point. Writing on Roger Ebert's website, Christy Lemire gave a mixed review in which she awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four. Lemire praised the visuals and the performance of [...] "Let It Go," [...] as well as the positive messages Frozen sends. However, she referred to the film as [...] "cynical" [...] and criticized it as an [...] "attempt <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> without shaking them up too much." [...] She also noted the similarity between Elsa and another well-known fictional female who unleashes paranormal powers when agitated, Carrie White.|$|E

His officers and opponents had become too used to his propensity for flanking movements; Sherman later wrote that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> and demonstrate that {{he was capable of}} different tactics, if a favorable opportunity arose. [...] With rain and mud rendering movement difficult, Sherman decided to assault Johnston head-on at Kennesaw Mountain, a 1,808-foot ridge that dominated the surrounding countrysideincluding the railroad on which he depended for supplies.

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If {{your goal is to}} do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ will no doubt mark the time <b>to</b> either <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|R
500|$|Dutch {{journalist}} Michiel Jongsma {{suggests that}} Kieftenbeld's position {{of choice is}} as a holding midfielder {{in front of the}} defence, where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball. He is comfortable on the ball and able to distribute it, but can be careless in possession, and [...] "he really tries <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>things</b> when the play has gone dormant. In that lies his weakness as wellhe can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time." [...] With Groningen, he averaged eight yellow cards a season. According to Groningen's technical director Henk Veldmate, speaking in 2014, his battling style and never-say-die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify. In a 2011 interview, Kieftenbeld described himself as a perfectionist who always wanted to improve, and said that he sometimes put too much pressure on himself.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015, it was {{revealed}} that after the Convergence miniseries in June 2015, DC would no longer use the New 52 name to brand their books; however the continuity established in September 2011 would continue. Dan DiDio stated, [...] "In this new era of storytelling, story will trump continuity as we continue to empower creators to tell the best stories". Jim Lee added, [...] "Rather than having 52 books all in the same continuity, and really focusing on keeping a universe that's tightly connected and has super-internal consistency, and really one flavor, we've really broken it up. We'll have a core line of about 25 books that will have that internal consistency, that will consist of our best-selling books. But then the rest of the line, about 24 titles, will be allowed <b>to</b> really <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> a little bit." [...] The new titles will be about “reinventing key characters,” such as Black Canary, Cyborg, Bizarro, and Starfire, with a new “contemporary tonality to ensure a diverse offering of comic books.” In the initial [...] "relaunch", 24 new publications joined 25 existing publications from before Convergence, with new titles continuing to be added. In March 2015, DiDio revealed there would not be an [...] "overarching brand on this" [...] stating the relaunch was just [...] "DC Comics, pure and simple." [...] However, in May 2015, DC announced the advertising campaign DC You for the relaunch, highlight the four main themes of characters, talent, stories and fans. The initiative, which began in DC's print and digital comics on May 20, before transitioning to other digital content on June 3, was featured on print inserts and ads, {{as well as on the}} DC Comics website and across social media with a special hashtag of #DCYou.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{official}} series order, Fox released a brief teaser {{for the series}} which /Film's Jacob Hall described as [...] "bland", particularly [...] "arriving {{in the wake of}} Logan, Deadpool, and FX's Legion, each of which proved that there’s plenty of gas in the tank for Mutantkind, provided that everyone involved is willing <b>to</b> really <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> and go for broke." [...] This was followed a week later by a full length trailer for Fox's May 2017 Upfront presentation, which Hoai-Tran Bui, also of /Film, said [...] "looks like a Singer take on Heroes." [...] Bui added, [...] "The Gifted is a bit more by-the-numbers Legion, airing on a primetime network, spearheaded by X-Men movie director Singer, and clearly connected to the movie universe ... Whether that connection helps or hinders the series is yet to be seen—as is Singer’s involvement, whose X-Men films become increasingly nonsensical and…bad." [...] The trailer had been viewed over 31 million times within a day of its release, including over 11 million views on YouTube. This was compared to the performance of the first trailer for This Is Us the year before, which went on to be a critical and commercial success.
