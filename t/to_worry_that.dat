5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} continued <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> {{cutbacks in}} {{federal funding for}} mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E
25|$|Maria Wyke {{has written}} that the play {{reflects}} the general anxiety of Elizabethan England over succession of leadership.

25|$|The suddenness of the €85 billion bailout deal led <b>to</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> Irish {{sovereignty}} {{had been}} lost, {{and that the}} Irish economy might not grow fast enough to afford the bailout costs.

25|$|The {{language}} of Section (V) is ambiguous, which led some critics <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> the language was too broad, potentially enabling students to circumvent copyright to access books, films, and music for coursework, or allowing professors to create course packs without obtaining permission from publishers.|$|E

25|$|One of Zoe's {{last major}} storylines {{was when she}} became romantically {{involved}} with Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). Zoe, persuaded by Dennis' father, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), claims she is pregnant to stop Dennis leaving Albert Square with Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). When Zoe starts <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> Dennis will realise she is lying, Den persuades Zoe to sleep with him so she can get pregnant, though Dennis sees them in bed together. Her final storyline was with Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) who plot to kill Den after hurting them, in different ways.

50|$|As per normal {{planning}} practise, {{a number}} of parties were consulted over the proposal. Amongst those asked to comment was the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), who replied by objecting to the proposal on November 23, 2009, due <b>to</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be too}} overbearing for Brindleyplace, that the proposal was driven more by financial concerns rather than urban design considerations, and that the design did not accommodate for the large numbers of people expected to be arriving and departing from the building.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, due in part <b>to</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} the {{building}} began sales, the New York City Department of Sanitation announced {{the construction of a}} truck garage across the street, at 353 Spring, which sparked controversy and a downturn in sales. The space was originally occupied by a UPS lot and a smaller Department of Sanitation building. During development, purchasers were made aware that a high rise or a garage could someday occupy the space. The new structure drew ire due <b>to</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> it would obscure views of the Hudson River for many of the residences in the building.|$|R
25|$|Becky {{stays with}} the Simpson family on Bart's suggestion. Marge {{consoles}} her, but when Becky begins {{to help out}} {{around the house and}} is praised for her contribution, Marge begins <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> her family likes Becky more than her. Eventually, she becomes paranoid and suspects that Becky is trying to kill her after her car won't stop on a steep road. Later, Becky {{and the rest of the}} family meet without Marge at an ice cream parlor, and Becky tells everyone that she has found a new apartment and is moving out. After she buys an unusually large bowl of ice cream, Homer freaks out upon the presence of so much ice cream and suddenly collapses. Becky gives him mouth-to-mouth but Marge comes in thinking she's kissing him. She grabs a cone and smashes it like a glass bottle to attack Becky. She is arrested and declared insane.|$|E
25|$|Later it was {{discussed}} that a separate branch should {{be created in}} order to handle everything pertaining to the anti-Castro movement. The White House division organized Branch 4 (WH/4)as the new task force to run Cuban Operations. The task force included 40 personnel, with 18 at headquarters, 20 at the Havana station, and 2 at Santiago base. The state department was concerned that if Castro was overthrown then the people to come after him would be worse than him. These people were Che Guevara and Raul Castro. So they proposed {{a way of getting}} a better leader that they approved of in his place. The CIA began <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> their involvement with the anti-Castro movement would lead to an anti-US movement. On March 14 of 1960, Dulles presented a “General Covert Action Plan for Cuba” that would focus only on the Cuban problems. Guerrilla capacity in the anti-Castro groups {{both in and out of}} Cuba {{was discussed}}.|$|E
25|$|During the {{continued}} investigation in Tashkent, {{the three were}} put under surveillance {{in one of the}} rooms for as long as four weeks where they were investigated for the reliability of their claims by the KGB. Soon after, they were satisfied with the results and sent them to Bulgaria for a secret retreat. On 9 October, the Soviet secret service had a meeting in which Bogdanov, Gorelov, Pavlonsky and Puzanov were the main chiefs who were discussing what to do with Amin who was very harsh at the meeting. After the two-hour meeting they began <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> Amin will establish an Islamic Republic in Afghanistan and decided to seek a way to put Karmal back in. They brought him and three other ministers secretly to Moscow during which time they discussed how to put him back in power. The decision was to fly him back to Bagram airbase by 13 December. Four days later, Amin's nephew, Asadullah, was taken to Moscow by the KGB for acute food poisoning treatment.|$|E

25|$|When Noah visits {{his father}} in prison, he crushes the Colonel's hopes by {{revealing}} that his marriage to Ameera is in name only and that he and Luke are still a couple. Not long thereafter, Ameera disappears, leaving a note saying {{that she will be}} able to stay in the country without the marriage and will have it annulled. Luke and Noah have little time to celebrate before they are advised that the Colonel has escaped from prison, which leads Noah to fear for his boyfriend's safety and also <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> Ameera has been kidnapped. When Noah tries to track him down, the Colonel assaults him, but he manages to get away and reunite with Luke and Ameera, who has also escaped the Colonel. The Colonel is determined to get Ameera back under his control and tricks the young men with some fake police officers, but Luke calls upon his grandmother Lucinda, who brings real police to protect them. Following a confrontation with his son, the Colonel dives into the water and does not resurface; he is believed dead. Noah blames Luke for this for a time, but the couple eventually reunite after Cyndi Lauper, in town on the True Colors Tour, dedicates a set to Luke. Noah tells Luke he wants to be with him, and the couple kiss again.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{they spent}} {{about two years}} on {{developing}} {{out the rest of}} the characters, gameplay balance, and graphics. Characters were generally added to the game for one of three reasons: to introduce a new gameplay mechanic or balance gameplay, to incorporate a new character design created by their artistic team, or to help support Overwatchs narrative. In addition to character balance, the development team needed to find ways to balance the characters with the various maps, wanting to provide areas across the maps for each character to have an area where they could be effective. The number of characters in the game was not fixed; though released with 21 different heroes, Kaplan stated the team played around with various goals, potentially as high as 40 unique heroes and across six different classes. Kaplan knew they had to have more than nine heroes as to separate themselves from Team Fortress 2, which featured nine distinct classes. Kaplan credits Jeff Goodman, a veteran designer in Blizzard, for figuring out the right number of heroes, classes, and balance between the characters. Keller noted that as the cast starting approaching about 15 characters, the team started <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> there were too many for players to learn and may dilute the experience, but they strived to assure both uniqueness and balance across the slate of Heroes. The team felt the game was ready for release in November 2015 after adding the last two characters, Mei and D.Va, to the roster.|$|E
500|$|Final editing of the {{programme}} {{was still}} under way while the IBA was considering Howe's requests, causing Bolton <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> {{it would not be}} completed in time.

25|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{was marred by}} an attack by a drunken 16-year-old wielding a knife, who stabbed {{members of the public}} leaving the ceremony. Forty-one people were wounded, six seriously, before the youth was arrested. According to police, the youth says he cannot remember his act of violence and is still denying it. One of the first stabbing victims was HIV-positive, leading <b>to</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> other victims may have been infected, although this did not prove to be the case. The youth was charged with attempted murder, and was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempted manslaughter in 33 cases in 2007.|$|R
