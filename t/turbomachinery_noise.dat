The favoured configuration is a blended wing design, with the engines located on the upper surface of the wing, to shield ground observers from the engine noise. A very low specific thrust (i.e. very high bypass ratio) turbofan is proposed for the aircraft. Engine handling and low jet noise are facilitated by the use of a variable area final nozzle, to rematch the fan. Acoustic treatment in the intake and exhaust ducting minimizes <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise.</b> Because the blended wing is too shallow to accommodate twin engines, a four-engine configuration is proposed.|$|E

The problem of jet noise has been substantially reduced in connection with the lower jet velocities employed {{in the case of the}} high bypass turbofan engines.

These data cover a range of exhaust velocity, flap deflection, exhaust nozzle position, exhaust nozzle shape, and ratio of exhaust nozzle diameter to wing chord. A semi-empirical method for predicting dipole noise radiation from a strut with incident turbulence was in good agreement with data. Leading-edge regions made of perforated plate backed by a bulk acoustic absorber achieved up to 7 db reduction of strut noise caused by incident turbulence at high frequencies.

40|$|A {{principal}} {{source of}} <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise</b> is {{the interaction of}} the rotating and stationary blade rows with the perturbations in the airstream through the engine. As such, a lot of research has been devoted {{to the study of the}} <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise</b> generation mechanisms. This is particularly true of fan and open rotors, both of which are the major contributors to the overall noise output of modern aircraft engines. Much of the research in fan and open rotor noise has been focused on developing theoretical models for predicting their noise characteristics. These models, which run the gamut from the semi-empirical to fully computational ones, are, in one form or another, informed by the description of the unsteady flow-field in which the propulsors (i. e., the fan and open rotors) operate. Not surprisingly, the fidelity of the theoretical models is dependent, to a large extent, on capturing the nuances of the unsteady flowfield that have a direct role in the noise generation process. As such, flow diagnostic techniques have proven to be indispensible in identifying the shortcoming of theoretical models and in helping to improve them. This presentation will provide a few examples of the role of flow diagnostic techniques in assessing the fidelity and robustness of the fan and open rotor noise prediction models...|$|E

Sections of the presentation cover: the SFW system level noise metrics for the 2015, 2020, and 2025 timeframes; the emerging importance of core noise and its relevance to the SFW Reduced-Noise-Aircraft Technical Challenge; the current research activities in the core-noise area, with some additional details given {{about the development of}} a high-fidelity combustion-noise prediction capability; the need for a core-noise diagnostic capability to generate benchmark data for validation of both high-fidelity work and improved models, as well as testing of future noise-reduction technologies; relevant existing core-noise tests using real engines and auxiliary power units; and examples of possible scenarios for a future diagnostic facility. The NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program has the principal objective of overcoming today's national challenges in air transportation. The SFW Reduced-Noise-Aircraft Technical Challenge aims to enable concepts and technologies to dramatically reduce the perceived aircraft noise outside of airport boundaries. This reduction of aircraft noise is critical for enabling the anticipated large increase in future air traffic. Noise generated in the jet engine core, by sources such as the compressor, combustor, and turbine, can be a significant contribution to the overall noise signature at low-power conditions, typical of approach flight. At high engine power during takeoff, jet and fan noise have traditionally dominated over core noise. However, current design trends and expected technological advances in engine-cycle design as well as noise-reduction methods are likely to reduce non-core noise even at engine-power points higher than approach. In addition, future low-emission combustor designs could increase the combustion-noise component. The trend towards high-power-density cores also means that the noise generated in the low-pressure turbine will likely increase. Consequently, the combined result from these emerging changes will be to elevate the overall importance of <b>turbomachinery</b> core <b>noise,</b> which will need to be addressed in order to meet future noise goals...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} is {{a summary of}} the core-noise implications of NASA's primary N+ 3 aircraft concepts. These concepts are the MIT/P&W D 8. 5 Double Bubble design, the Boeing/GE SUGAR Volt hybrid gas-turbine/electric engine concept, the NASA N 3 -X Turboelectric Distributed Propulsion aircraft, and the NASA TBW-XN Truss-Braced Wing concept. The first two are future concepts for the Boeing 737 /Airbus A 320 US transcontinental mission of 180 passengers and a maximum range of 3000 nm. The last two are future concepts for the Boeing 777 transpacific mission of 350 passengers and a 7500 nm range. Sections of the presentation cover: turbofan design trends on the N+ 1. 5 time frame and the already emerging importance of core noise; the NASA N+ 3 concepts and associated core-noise challenges; the historical trends for the engine bypass ratio (BPR), overall pressure ratio (OPR), and combustor exit temperature; and brief discussion of a noise research roadmap being developed to address the core-noise challenges identified for the N+ 3 concepts. The N+ 3 conceptual aircraft have (i) ultra-high bypass ratios, in the rage of 18 - 30, accomplished by either having a small-size, high-power-density core, an hybrid design which allows for an increased fan size, or by utilizing a turboelectric distributed propulsion design; and (ii) very high OPR in the 50 - 70 range. These trends will elevate the overall importance of <b>turbomachinery</b> core <b>noise.</b> The N+ 3 conceptual designs specify the need for the development and application of advanced liners and passive and active control strategies to reduce the core noise. Current engineering prediction of core noise uses semi-empirical methods based on older turbofan engines, with (at best) updates for more recent designs. The models have not seen the same level of development and maturity as those for fan and jet noise and are grossly inadequate for the designs considered for the N+ 3 time frame.

This thesis {{is part of the}} N+ 2 program and focuses on the development of a method for the assessment of <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise</b> shielding in hybrid wing body aircraft. The preliminary design and assessment of novel aircraft configurations require both low computational cost and versatility of the shielding method. High fidelity methods, such as for example boundary element methods, are computationally expensive and not amenable for optimization framework integration. On the other hand, low fidelity methods, such as the barrier shielding method, are limited in their source and geometry definitions. The diffraction integral method is a simplified ray tracing method capturing edge diffracted rays. Creeping rays and reflected rays are not accounted for making the method suitable for flat geometries with sharp edges. It is based on the Maggi-Rubinowicz formulation of the Kirchoff diffraction theory for monopole source descriptions and is inherently a high frequency method. The diffraction line integral requires numerical integration and does not account for flight effects. A new method described in this thesis was developed to address these shortcomings. It is based on the Miyamoto and Wolf formulation of the boundary diffraction theory to allow the definition of source directivity inherent to <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise.</b> It is amenable to multipole and directional point source descriptions. Bulk flight effects are modelled with a generalized Prandtl-Glauert approach. Computational cost is dramatically decreased using uniform asymptotic theory to reduce the diffraction integral into a simple Fresnel integral. The Fresnel integral is solved via an analytical approximation such that the resulting shielding method does not require numerical integration. The method is applicable to three-dimensional aircraft configurations and comparison with an equivalent source method for sphere and disk shielding test cases show good agreement at high frequencies.

Inflow control coupled with detailed diagnostic tools such as blade pressure measurements can be used to uncover the more subtle mechanisms such as rotor strut interaction, which can set tone levels for some engine configurations. Initial mappings of rotor wake-vortex flow fields have provided a data base for a first generation semiempirical flow disturbance model. Laser velocimetry offers a nonintrusive method for validating and improving the model. Digital data systems and signal processing algorithms are bringing mode measurement closer to a working tool that can be frequently applied to a real machine such as a turbofan engine. On the analytical side, models of most of the links in the chain from turbomachine blade source to far field observation point have been formulated. Three dimensional lifting surface theory for blade rows, including source noncompactness and cascade effects, blade row transmission models incorporating mode and frequency scattering, and modal radiation calculations, including hybrid numerical-analytical approaches, are tools which await further application...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic liners {{placed in}} the intake and bypass ducts of {{commercial}} turbofan aeroengines have {{played a major role}} in reducing the environmental impact of <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise</b> at take-off and approach. The fan stage is the principal source of <b>turbomachinery</b> <b>noise</b> for a modern High Bypass Ratio (HBR) turbofan engine. Typically a turbofan liner is formed from single or double layers of honeycomb material which are separated from the flow and from each other by porous sheets, and fixed to a rigid backing sheet. The acoustic performance of such panels depends upon the nature and spectrum of the source, on the depth of the honeycomb(s) and the resistance(s) of the internal ‘septum’ (in the case of a double layer) and facing sheet, which in turn depend upon gross parameters such as percentage open area but also by more subtle details such as the diameter and profile of the holes, thickness of the sheet, and whether or not a mesh is overlayed to produce a more ‘linear’ response at high sound pressure levels. Overall liner performance is assessed by the extent to which it contributes to a reduction in whole aircraft noise in the far field, as measured by Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) at three noise certification points (lateral, cutback and approach). The selection of physical liner parameters (depth, hole size, open area etc) to reduce EPNL is a complex task which requires the following components: 1. An impedance model which can translate physical liner parameters, such as honeycomb depth, facing sheet percentage open area, hole diameter etc, into resistance and reactance at the surface of the liner. 2. A source model which defines the modal content of the sound field propagating away from the fan stage at the fan face (intake) and OGV (bypass duct). 3. A propagation model to predict sound attenuation in the intake and bypass duct taking into account geometric non-uniformities, mean flow effects and absorption by acoustically treated segments of the duct wall. 4. A radiation model to propagate the acoustic disturbance from the nacelle to the far field, and to predicts the directivity of the resulting sound field. 5. An optimization procedure which embeds steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 within an EPNL calculation for the whole aircraft (including other noise sources). This process represented by steps 2 to 4 is illustrated in figure 1 for the case of exhaust radiation. The current paper deals with potential strategies for implementing step 5 of the above sequence. The study presented in this paper explores the feasibility of using modern CAA tools to perform steps 3 and 4 in the above sequence, and to run such computations within a modern multi-objective optimization suite in step 5 to automate the liner optimization procedure. The computational resources required are shown to be acceptable for realistic optimization or HBR intake liners and the results are shown to be consistent with those obtained using a less automated approach. <br/...|$|E
40|$|<b>Turbomachinery</b> <b>noise</b> {{radiating}} {{into the}} rearward arc {{is an important}} problem. This noise is scattered by the trailing edges of the nacelle and the jet exhaust, and interacts with the shear layers between the external flow, bypass stream and jet, {{en route to the}} far field. In the past a range of relevant model problems involving semi-infinite cylinders have been solved. However, one limitation of these previous solutions is that they do not allow for the jet nozzle protruding a finite distance beyond the end of the nacelle (or in certain configurations being buried a finite distance upstream). With this in mind, we have used the matrix Wiener-Hopf technique to allow precisely this finite nacelle-jet nozzle separation to be included. We have previously reported results for the case of hard-walled ducts, which requires factorisation of a 2 × 2 matrix. In this paper we extend this work by allowing one of the duct walls, in this case the outer wall of the jet pipe, to be acoustically lined. This results in the need to factorise a 3 × 3 matrix, which is completed by use of a combination of pole-removal and Pade ́ approximant techniques. Sample results are presented, investigating in particular the effects of exit plane stagger and liner impedance. Here we take the mean flow to be zero, but extension to nonzero Mach numbers in the core and bypass flow has also been completed. I...|$|E
