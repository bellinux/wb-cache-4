5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>people.</b> They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} criticized for its {{large number of}} collaborations and producers. The Guardians Caroline Sullivan argued that although [...] "others lend a hand [...] it's very much Stefani's show"; however, most others disagreed. Jason Damas of PopMatters compared the album to a second No Doubt greatest hits album, and Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester felt that {{the large number of}} collaborators result in sacrificing Stefani's identity on the album. Anthony Carew of Neumu expressed that the album's fragmentation kept it from being [...] "a bright-and-shiny pop-music [...] ". Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that [...] "Stefani tries to be all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>people</b> here", but that the result [...] "comes off as manipulative and contrived." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne shared this opinion, stating that the album [...] "is like one of those [...] retail magazines that resembles a catalog more than an old-fashioned collection of, say, articles." ...|$|E

In 1763, Marc-Michel Rey in Amsterdam published a letter from Yvon answering some of Rousseau's criticisms of the Church, and more followed in the ensuing years.

He accused Rousseau of saying that no laws were good and no governments fair. He said that after making reckless personal attacks on religion and government, <b>things</b> sacred <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>people,</b> Rousseau was unrealistic in expecting no outrage against his views.|$|R

60|$|Lady Ushant on {{receiving}} the letter much doubted what {{she ought to}} do. She acknowledged at once Mary's right to appeal to her, and assured herself that the girl's presence would be a comfort and a happiness to herself. If Mary were quite {{alone in the world}} Lady Ushant would have been at once prepared to give her a home. But she doubted as to the propriety of taking the girl from her own family. She doubted even whether it would not be better that Mary should be left within the influence of Larry Twentyman's charms. A settlement, an income, and assured comforts for life are very serious <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>people</b> who have reached Lady Ushant's age. And then she had a doubt within her own mind whether Mary might not be debarred from accepting this young man by some unfortunate preference for Reginald Morton. She had seen them together and had suspected something of the truth before it had glimmered before the eyes of any one in Dillsborough. Had Reginald been so inclined Lady Ushant would have been very glad to see him marry Mary Masters. For both their sakes she would have preferred such a match to one with the owner of Chowton Farm. But she did not think that Reginald himself was that way minded, and she fancied that poor Mary might be throwing away her prosperity in life were she to wait for Reginald's love. Larry Twentyman was at any rate sure;--and perhaps it might be unwise to separate the girl from her lover.|$|E

What does it mean to achieve a diversified profession? Diversity and multiculturalism are increasingly being professed in educational arenas. However, even as our nation becomes more culturally pluralistic, it appears that many professional education programs, including physical therapy, are falling short of achieving diversity. This may be due, in part, to the lack of a clarified definition of diversity. It is often assumed that the term means the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>people</b> and that <b>all</b> <b>people</b> know what it means. Neither assumption is correct. The purposes of this study were to explore how physical therapists from diverse backgrounds define and exemplify diversity in the profession and to determine how physical therapy professional education programs can achieve diversity. Twenty-eight physical therapists from diverse cultural backgrounds participated in this study. A semistructured interview format was utilized and centered on the conceptual categories of diversity and multiculturalism. Grounded theory methodology was applied and involved simultaneous data collection, coding and analysis through constant comparison. The emerging theory was coined "interculturalization. " Interculturalization describes a paradigm evidenced by an ensemble of diversity, multiculturalism and conviction to allow a harmonious interchange and deferential learning environment between <b>people</b> of <b>all</b> cultures. The components of interculturalization [...] -diversity, multiculturalism and conviction [...] -are so interconnected that each cannot exist in solo, but only in ensemble. A professional education program must have diversity, multiculturalism, and conviction for interculturalization to be attained. This document provides meta-policy guidelines for professional programmatic attainment of diversity, multiculturalism and conviction to ultimately achieve interculturalization. The inexorable link between diversity, multiculturalism, and conviction will be highlighted since these interconnections are fundamental to the goal of interculturalization. It is conviction that drives direct action in the form of practices/applications, ethical practice, influencing of policies, advocacy, and community outreach to achieve interculturalization. Although this research is based on the physical therapy profession, the model of interculturalization is applicable to other professions and educational settings. As society become more culturally pluralistic and international, the phenomenon of interculturalization provides a timely and relevant paradigm to ensure equity and culturally proficiency in the professions...|$|R
