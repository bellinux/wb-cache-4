5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, <b>the</b> <b>stalks</b> of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of <b>the</b> <b>stalks</b> on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used <b>the</b> <b>stalks</b> of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{localization}} mechanisms {{dictate the}} functional and structural specialization of cells. Of the four polar surface organelles featured by the dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> a cylindrical extension of all cell envelope layers, {{is the least}} well characterized at the molecular level. Here we apply a powerful experimental scheme that integrates genetics with high-throughput localization to discover StpX, an uncharacterized bitopic membrane protein that modulates stalk elongation and is sequestered to <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> In stalkless mutants StpX is dispersed. Two populations of StpX were discernible within <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> with different mobilities: an immobile one near <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> base and a mobile one near <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> tip. Molecular anatomy provides evidence that (i) the StpX transmembrane domain enables access to <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> organelle, (ii) <b>the</b> N-terminal periplasmic domain mediates retention in <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> and (iii) <b>the</b> C-terminal cytoplasmic domain enhances diffusion within <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> accumulation of StpX and an N-terminally truncated isoform is differentially coordinated with the cell cycle.

25|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, grain was threshed {{to remove it}} from <b>the</b> <b>stalks</b> by beating it with sticks or by oxen {{treading}} on it.

Only <b>the</b> apical 10 – 20 % of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> and a small region adjacent to the rhizoid remained uncalcified.

To test this model extracellular pH and extracellular hydrogen ion gradients were examined with ion-selective, self-referencing, electrodes. In the light, A. acetabulum displayed a general pattern of extracellular alkalinity around the entire alga, although in some individuals the region near the rhizoid and the rhizoid itself displayed extracellular acidity. Acetabularia acetabulum also displayed net hydrogen ion influx at the rhizoid and the apical half of <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> variable flux in the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> and net hydrogen ion efflux at the base of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> next to <b>the</b> rhizoid.
