The Stevens inquiry in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pinhas Zahavi and Barry Silkman.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since its}} rediscovery, the stone {{has been the}} focus of {{nationalist}} rivalries, including its <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> French to British possession during the Napoleonic Wars, a long-running dispute over the relative value of Young and Champollion's contributions to the decipherment and, since 2003, demands for the stone's return to Egypt.|$|E

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge {{or outside the}} city limits. This was very impractical for many passengers, who were forced to use hackney carriages to <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2017, Wenger brought in two signings; Alexandre Lacazette for a fee of £45m, the club's most {{expensive}} signing and Sead Kolašinac on a free <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> Schalke 04. On 6 August 2017, Wenger won his 7th FA Community Shield as manager as Arsenal beat Chelsea 4–1 on penalties following a 1–1 score at full time.|$|E

5|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is a key}} part of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines {{is another important}} application of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> oxaziridines. Though less widely applied, the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent. The examples shown below are representative; in the latter, an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding amine.|$|E

5|$|There was a <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> the Coney Island Terminal to the Norton's Point Trolley to Sea Gate, via an {{elevated}} footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated trolley station. In 1948, the trolley was discontinued because it duplicated another trolley along a similar route (namely the McDonald Avenue Line). The trolley ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was torn down around this time.|$|E
5|$|There were {{a number}} of first-team {{personnel}} changes from the previous campaign, with only six first-team players staying at the club. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top scorer in 1921–22 with 16 league goals, remained along with Clement Rigg, Sid Hoad and Bob Lilley. Scottish defenders John Steel and James Price also continued to play for Nelson. Among those who left the club were Harold Andrews, who joined Bury, and Irish international inside forward Billy Halligan, who retired from professional football. Goalkeepers Harry Heyes and Robert Bruce both moved on in the close season, so Stockport County custodian Joseph Birds was signed as a replacement in June 1922. In an attempt to improve the attacking prowess at the club, Wilson signed experienced inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme on a free <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> Darlington in May 1922, and Scottish forward Mike McCulloch arrived from Heart of Midlothian for a transfer fee of £150. Wilson also added to the defensive ranks with the signings of his former Oldham Athletic team-mate Ernie Braidwood, and of Jimmy Broadhead on a free <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> Scunthorpe & Lindsey United.|$|E

5|$|According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4 systems was {{to enable}} the crews to gather, process and display up to 20 times more {{technical}} and strategic data than the MR2. The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; {{with the ability to}} have swept {{an area the size of}} the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|E
5|$|Albion's most capped {{international}} player, {{taking into}} account only those caps won while at the club, is Chris Brunt. He has appeared 38 times for Northern Ireland as a West Brom player, earning 48 caps in total. Jesse Pennington is the club's most capped England international, with 25 caps. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is £12million to Zenit Saint Petersburg for Salomón Rondón on 10 August 2015; the deal could rise to over £15million with appearance fee and other add-ons. The record <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> Albion to another club is that of Curtis Davies to Aston Villa in July 2008 for a fee of £8.5million.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith died {{soon after}} Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been {{considered}} one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid {{to stay out of}} Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign lasted only a few months however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid may have been one of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John's <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the four}} {{graduates}} the Air Force had enrolled in 1927, budgetary constraints imposed during the Great Depression necessitated the <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> Duntroon to Point Cook of eight other RAAF-sponsored cadets midway through their four-year course, including Alister Murdoch, Bill Garing and Douglas Candy. Initially ranked pilot officer, Hely commenced his flying training course at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, on 15January 1931, graduating on 10December. His early postings as a pilot in 1932 and 1933 were to RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Qualifying in aerial photography, he served at Point Cook from 1933 to 1936. He was then transferred to No.3 Squadron at Richmond, receiving promotion to flight lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|BART service begins around 4:00 am on weekdays, 6:00 am on Saturdays, and 8:00 am on Sundays.

The Coliseum–Oakland International Airport AGT line runs every 6 minutes, with approximately the same operating hours as the five rapid transit lines.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service.

As a result passengers wishing to <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
