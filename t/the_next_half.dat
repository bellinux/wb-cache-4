5|$|Colt set up {{libraries}} and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were seminal training grounds for {{several generations of}} toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century. Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt, Amos Whitney, Henry Leland, Edward Bullard, Worcester R. Warner, Charles Brinckerhoff Richards, William Mason and Ambrose Swasey.|$|E
5|$|The {{built-in}} gyroscope {{allows for}} some image stabilization {{for the camera}} while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms {{do not need to}} use a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being able to take its first picture in 1.1seconds and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> a second later.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{remained}} inactive for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> month, not attacking until September 15 when {{he landed}} a force at Kip's Bay. The British quickly occupied the city. On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the fire Nathan Hale was executed for spying. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State University Water Polo Club {{was founded}} and officially {{recognized}} November 17, 1967. At {{the time of}} its inception, the team played in the Midwest Collegiate Water Polo Association, along with Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio State, Loyola, Drake, and Western Michigan. Now competing in the Big Ten division of the Collegiate Water Polo Association, Michigan State is joined by Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Purdue, and Illinois, with Ohio State moving to the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. After winning back-to-back Big Ten championships in 1993 and 1994, the Spartans would go <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> a decade without a Big Ten Championship. With another conference championship, the Spartans would go on to win their first national collegiate club championship in 2000. Michigan State would continue to enjoy much success in the 2000s, winning the Big Ten Championship in 2002 and from 2005–2010. This included an impressive four year stretch which included the Spartan's second and third national championships in 2006 and 2008, and runner-up finishes for the national title in 2005 and 2007, as well as a third-place finish in 2010. In 2014, the Spartans would stage a comeback in the final two minutes of regulation to upset Michigan in the Big Ten title game for their eleventh Big Ten Championship, and their seventh in ten years.|$|E
25|$|Jung and Freud {{personally}} met for {{the last}} time in September 1913 for the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the introverted and extraverted type in analytical psychology. This constituted the introduction of some of the key concepts which came to distinguish Jung's work from Freud's in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century.|$|E
25|$|This {{decision}} {{marked the}} start of the Supreme Court's recognition that due process protected individual liberties; specifically, the Court recognized consciously that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to entities other than individuals, and recognized the scope of liberties or rights which it protected included personal civil liberties. Over the course of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century, that list would include the right to marry, to have children, to marital privacy, to have an abortion, and others.|$|E

Newman and Perkins worked together to improve working conditions. Perkins and Newman took state legislators on tours of the worst factories in the state and through this, Newman gained the respect of these political figures, who would call on her for advice or consultation many times over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century.|$|E
25|$|Colt {{had set up}} {{libraries}} and educational programs within the plants for his employees. Colt's armories in Hartford were seminal training grounds for several generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century. Prominent examples included F.Pratt and A.Whitney (as mentioned above); Henry Leland (who would end up at Cadillac and Lincoln); Edward Bullard Sr of the Bullard firm; and, through Pratt & Whitney, Worcester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey (of Warner & Swasey).|$|E
25|$|The state's {{water supply}} {{commission}} ruled in the city's favor, {{and once the}} city began acquiring land most local objections faded because local lawyers, well versed in the tangled history of land claims on the former Hardenburgh Patent, were able to negotiate prices highly favorable to local landowners. The reservoir was completed in 1913 and began delivering its first water to the city via the Catskill Aqueduct two years later. It became the prototype for six other reservoirs built in the region over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century.|$|E

25|$|Wolves {{bought the}} {{freehold}} in 1923 and soon {{began a series}} of ground improvements, beginning with the construction of a major grandstand on the Waterloo Road side. In 1932, the club also built a new stand on the Molineux Street side and followed this by adding a roof to the South Bank two years later; this South Bank was historically the second largest of all Kop ends in the country and regularly held crowds in excess of 30,000. The stadium finally now had four complete stands that would form its basis for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century.|$|E
25|$|Following the , for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> {{millennium}} Berber Ifriqiya enjoyed self-rule (1048−1574). The Fatimids were Shi'a, specifically of {{the more}} controversial Isma'ili branch. They originated in Islamic lands far to the east. Today, and for many centuries, the majority of Tunisians identify as Sunni (also from the east, but who oppose the Shi'a). In Ifriqiyah, {{at the time of}} the Fatimids, there was disdain for any rule from the east regardless if it was Sunni or Shi'a. Hence the rise in medieval Tunisia (Ifriqiya) of regimes not beholden to the east (al-Mashriq), which marks a new and a popular era of Berber sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Obdurate {{continued}} {{to investigate the}} surface contact and subsequently located two German submarines. Coming under attack from one of these submarines, the destroyer dropped depth charges before turning away to attack the Zeppelin. As the destroyer closed on it, though, the Zeppelin turned away to the south-east. Within the space of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an hour, Dublin was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarines {{at least three times}} with torpedoes, leading Dumaresq to conclude that the Germans were attempting to spring a trap on the British vessels. He subsequently ordered Obdurate to complete its investigation of the suspect vessel, which was subsequently determined to be a Dutch fishing vessel.|$|E
5000|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> century, <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> {{estimated}} 80,000 Spanish Jews {{converted to}} Christianity (becoming [...] "conversos"). The final step {{was taken by}} the Catholic Monarchs, who, in 1492, ordered the remaining Jews to convert or face expulsion from Spain. Depending on different sources, the number of Jews actually expelled, traditionally estimated at 120,000 people, is now believed to have numbered about 40,000.|$|R

25|$|Management of {{the estate}} passed to Sir Thomas's widow, Elizabeth Weld. However, their son, Sir John Wolryche (1691–1723), the fourth baronet, came to {{maturity}} in 1712 and took over the reins. For a decade he spent heavily on gambling, horses and hunting. In 1723, attempting to ford the Severn after attending races at Chelmarsh, directly opposite Dudmaston, he drowned, leaving no male heir. The estate was burdened by heavy debts and was passed to Sir John's sister, Mary, only on payment of £14,000. She, her mother Elizabeth, and her uncle, Colonel Thomas Weld, resided at Dudmaston, and over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century, largely restored it to a sound financial footing by frugal management.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous {{contribution}} to Scouting that Silber has become known for were his belt buckles. In 1950, Max was chosen to be a Scoutmaster for the National Scout Jamboree. He was in the metal ingot business and had souvenir buckles produced for the event which he gave out as friendship gifts. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century, he made fifty more buckles for national Scout jamboree, world jamborees, New Hampshire jamborees and other special occasions as well as recognition buckles for significant awards such as Eagle Scout, Vigil Honor, and Wood Badge. His buckles have become world-famous and are considered highly prized collectors' items. Amongst collectors, some of the Silber buckles fetch prices {{in the hundreds of}} dollars as evidenced on auction sites such as eBay.|$|E
25|$|The {{fear that}} the Americans might again attempt to conquer Canada {{remained}} a serious concern for at least <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century, and was the chief reason for the retention of a large British garrison in the colony. From the 1820s to the 1840s, there was extensive construction of fortifications, as the British attempted to create strong points around which defending forces might centre {{in the event of}} an American invasion; these include the Citadels at Quebec City and Halifax, and Fort Henry in Kingston. The Rideau Canal was built to allow ships in wartime to travel a more northerly route from Montreal to Kingston; the customary peacetime route was the St. Lawrence River, which constituted the northern edge of the American border, and thus was vulnerable to enemy attack and interference.|$|E

25|$|The Metro has a {{very large}} {{expansion}} plan for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century. The Pravoberezhnaya Line was split in early 2009, and the new fifth line (Frunzensko-Primorskaya) took the northern (Primorsky) radius away from Pravoberezhnaya and opened with a new section (Frunzensky) to the south. The Pravoberezhnaya line will extend to the west, and then north to Lakhta, and then to Yuntolovo. The two stations, Bukharestskaya and Mezhdunarodnaya of the Frunzensko-Primorskaya line, opened in December 2012, {{will be followed by}} another three heading southward - Prospekt Slavy, Dunayskaya and Shushary. These should be open by 2017-2018. Three new lines, Krasnosel'sko-Kalininskaya, Admiralteysko-Okhtinskaya and Koltsevaya, will be opened. The first six stations of the Krasnosel'sko-Kalininskaya line are already under construction, and should be open by 2020. The Admiralteysko-Okhtinskaya line should appear before 2025. The Koltsevaya line will be opened after 2025.|$|E
25|$|In the {{electrical}} schematic to the right, a typical silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) based light dimmer dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> cycle. This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, an American, Samuel Colt {{patented}} {{the mechanism}} {{that led to}} the widespread use of the revolver, the mechanically indexing cylinder. According to Samuel Colt, he {{came up with the idea}} for the revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, which had a ratchet and pawl mechanism on it, a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder by cocking the hammer. This provided a reliable and repeatable way to index each round and did away with the need to manually rotate the cylinder. Revolvers proliferated largely due to Colt's ability as a salesman. But his influence spread in other ways as well; the build quality of his company's guns became famous, and its armories in America and England trained several seminal generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> century.|$|E
