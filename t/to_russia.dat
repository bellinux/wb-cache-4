40|$|The {{proposition}} that EU climate policy represents a threat <b>to</b> <b>Russia’s</b> gas exports <b>to</b> the EU, and therefore <b>to</b> <b>Russia’s</b> energy security, is critically examined.

However, the coming decades could see Russia’s energy security increasingly influenced by climate-change action policies undertaken by current importers of Russian gas such as the EU, and potential importers such as China and India.
