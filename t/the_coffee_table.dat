[...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E

I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Each {{of these}} {{material}} objects carries {{along with its}} stories or memories the ability for family members to experience simultaneity in the home. [...] "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times {{of our lives and}} our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present." [...] The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. [...] "The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers." [...] The candy bowl on <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family.|$|E

Until recently, it was merely a transition space – people would move through {{it in order to}} get to their next class. It is a large rectangular area measuring approximately 20 by 5 metres and rising three stories high. In many ways, it resembles a classical loggia. The new space consists of a raised, carpeted seating area. Large, comfortable couches, freemoving ottomans, and circular <b>coffee</b> <b>tables</b> are located in this space. The couches are of the highest commercial quality to guard against stains and potential misuse. Each of <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>tables</b> has four inbuilt power points for students to be able to plug in their notebook computers and other electronic devices.
