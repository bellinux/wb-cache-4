5|$|Cædwalla was unbaptised {{when he came}} to {{the throne}} of Wessex, and {{remained}} so throughout his reign, but though he is often referred to as a pagan <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the most apt description; it may be that he was already Christian in his beliefs but delayed his baptism to a time of his choice. He was clearly respectful of the church, with charter evidence showing multiple grants to churches and for religious buildings. When Cædwalla first attacked the South Saxons, Wilfrid was at the court of King Æthelwealh, and on Æthelwealh's death Wilfrid attached himself to Cædwalla; the Life of Wilfrid records that Cædwalla sought Wilfrid out as a spiritual father. Bede states that Cædwalla vowed to give a quarter of the Isle of Wight to the church if he conquered the island, and that Wilfrid was the beneficiary when the vow was fulfilled; Bede also says that Cædwalla agreed to let the heirs of Arwald, the king of the Isle of Wight, be baptised before they were executed. Two of Cædwalla's charters were grants of land to Wilfrid, and there is also subsequent evidence that Cædwalla worked with Wilfrid and Eorcenwald, a bishop of the East Saxons, to establish an ecclesiastical infrastructure for Sussex. However, there is no evidence that Wilfrid exerted any influence over Cædwalla's secular activities or his campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{was raised}} on 26 April 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, {{shortly after the}} start of World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was {{established}} at the time from personnel that had volunteered to serve in combat overseas. The battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and would remain part of this formation throughout its existence. It had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, and most of those were drawn from the state of Victoria, although some were allocated from other states later as reinforcements. Many of the battalion's initial recruits had previous military experience, having served in the Militia prior to volunteering for the 2nd AIF, with the majority having to relinquish rank to transfer. Officially the battalion's average age on formation was 29, although the battalion historian, William Russell, asserts that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> accurate as men were found to have altered their ages both up (from as young as 15) and down (from as old as 55) upon recruitment. In keeping with 2nd AIF recruitment practices, there were many pairs of brothers who were early recruits; there was even one case of a father and son who served in the same platoon.|$|E

50|$|At the time, it was {{commonly}} {{believed that}} drowning involved agitated behaviors, although Pia cites an earlier (unspecified) 1966 paper as likewise observing that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the case.|$|R
50|$|While {{the term}} 'revolution' implies radical and {{widespread}} change, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the case. Even in the 'liberal' sixties, conservative, traditionalist views were widely held, and many modern historians {{and social scientists}} are beginning to think that 'revolution' is {{too much of an}} overstatement.|$|R

25|$|A unary {{operation}} always commutes with itself, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> {{the case for}} a binary (or higher arity) operation. A binary (or higher arity) operation that commutes with itself is called medial or entropic.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the central}} criticisms of Gestaltism {{are based on the}} {{preference}} Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception.|$|E
25|$|By itself, {{the law of}} {{conservation}} of momentum {{is not enough to}} determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, kinetic energy, must be known. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision; if not, it is an inelastic collision.|$|E

2500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the Dvergatal section and the part where the [...] "Almighty who rules over all" [...] are later insertions to the poem. Although some have identified [...] "the Almighty" [...] (a seemingly alien concept in Norse Mythology) with Jesus, Bellows thought <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the case.|$|R
25|$|Installment publishing: {{books were}} issued in parts until a {{complete}} book had <b>been</b> issued. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> done within a fixed time period. It was an effective method of spreading the cost {{over a period}} of time. It also allowed earlier returns on investment to help cover the production costs of subsequent installments.|$|R
25|$|Common {{confusion}} is that public goods are goods {{provided by the}} public sector. Although it {{is often the case}} that government is involved in producing public goods, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the case. Public goods may be naturally available. They may be produced by private individuals and firms, by non-state collective action, or they may not be produced at all.|$|E
25|$|In a {{phenomenon}} {{which can be}} likened {{to the theory of}} cultural cringe, a considerable number of Canadians reflexively dismiss all Canadian films as inherently inferior to Hollywood studio fare. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> connected to reality, as many critically acclaimed films have been made in Canada, but the idea nevertheless presents a significant hurdle to Canadian filmmakers seeking to build an audience for their work.|$|E
25|$|Limerence can be {{intensified}} after {{a sexual}} relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the case.|$|E

25|$|The same {{test for}} Wednesbury {{unreasonableness}} {{was referred to}} in other cases like Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2006), and City Developments Ltd. v. Chief Assessor (2008). However, the courts also considered whether the decision-makers had taken irrelevant factors into account in deciding whether the decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> inconsistent with Wednesbury unreasonableness as Lord Greene said that taking extraneous factors into account could be seen an aspect of such unreasonableness.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{division of}} the material and spiritual is not altogether foreign to the Avesta; Geti and Mainyu (middle Persian: menog) are terms in Mazdaist tradition, where Ahura Mazda {{is said to have}} created all first in its spiritual, then later in its material form. But the material Zurvanites redefined menog to suit Aristotelian principles to mean ‘that which did not (yet) have matter’, or alternatively, ‘that which was still the unformed primal matter’. Even <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a violation of orthodox Zoroastrian tradition, since the divinity Vayu is present in the middle space between Ormuzd and Ahriman, the void separating the kingdoms of light and darkness.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} for authors and researchers, whether individually or in a team, to spot every mistake or flaw in a complicated piece of work. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a reflection on those concerned, but because with a new and perhaps eclectic subject, an opportunity for improvement may be more obvious to someone with special expertise or who simply looks at it with a fresh eye. Therefore, showing work to others increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and improved. For both grant-funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also normally a requirement that the subject is both novel and substantial.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} the 11th century BCE, scribes in Ancient Israel, were also {{distinguished}} professionals who would exercise functions which today could be associated with lawyers, journalists, government ministers, judges, or financiers.

50|$|King Offa of Mercia {{presided over}} a church council held at Chelsea in the 787. Although {{it has often been}} claimed that the council was {{attended}} by papal legates, this stems from a conflation of the visit by papal legates to Offa's court and Northumbria in 786. The two legates did attend a council held at Offa's court, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> held at Chelsea.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the only}} means for race {{officials}} to communicate to drivers was through the usage of flags. With the advent of two-way or full-duplex radios, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the case. Most drivers racing on paved short track oval courses do not rely on flags; rather, they are informed of track conditions by their crew chiefs and spotters or by yellow / red flashing lights found on most oval tracks. Occasionally, though, some drivers must rely {{on the use of}} flags for information when they experience radio malfunctions. Flags are still used to tell the crowd of spectators what is happening. Dirt track and lower level racers are less likely to have radios than their paved track counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Lobsters are omnivores and {{typically}} eat live prey such as fish, mollusks, other crustaceans, worms, and some plant life. They scavenge if necessary, and {{are known to}} resort to cannibalism in captivity. However, when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> evidence of cannibalism – lobsters eat their shed skin after moulting. While cannibalism {{was thought to be}} nonexistent among wild lobster populations, it was observed in 2012 by researchers studying wild lobsters in Maine. These first known instances of lobster cannibalism in the wild are theorized to be attributed to a local population explosion among lobsters caused by the disappearance of many of the Maine lobsters' natural predators.|$|E
25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> true of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds {{no justification for}} homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds {{that people should be}} free to be promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments that appeal to scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{were quick}} to draw {{comparisons}} to Robin Thicke's [...] "Blurred Lines", which was also produced by Williams, due to its similar beat.

25|$|When {{interpreting}} the Tanakh, Karaites strive {{to adhere to}} the plain or most obvious meaning (peshat) of the text; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the literal meaning, but rather the meaning that would have been naturally understood by the ancient Israelites when the books of the Tanakh were first written. By contrast, Rabbinic Judaism relies on the legal rulings of the Sanhedrin as they are codified in the Midrash, Talmud, and other sources to indicate the authentic meaning of the Torah. Karaite Judaism holds every interpretation of the Tanakh to the same scrutiny regardless of its source, and teaches that it is the personal responsibility of every individual Jew to study the Torah, and ultimately decide personally its correct meaning. Karaites may consider arguments made in the Talmud and other works without exalting them above other viewpoints.|$|E
25|$|In many {{cultures}} of the Old and New Worlds, this gemstone has been esteemed {{for thousands of years}} as a holy stone, a bringer of good fortune or a talisman. The oldest evidence for this claim was found in Ancient Egypt, where grave furnishings with turquoise inlay were discovered, dating from approximately 3000BCE. In the ancient Persian Empire, the sky-blue gemstones were earlier worn round the neck or wrist as protection against unnatural death. If they changed colour, the wearer was thought to have reason to fear the approach of doom. Meanwhile, it has been discovered that the turquoise certainly can change colour, but that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a sign of impending danger. The change can be caused by the light, or by a chemical reaction brought about by cosmetics, dust or the acidity of the skin.|$|E
25|$|In season four, J.D. {{finishes}} his residency {{and becomes a}} full-blown colleague of Dr. Cox, although their dynamic does not change much. As the season opens, Turk arrives from his honeymoon with Carla, but they soon start having issues when Carla tries to change many things about her new husband. Their marriage and Turk's friendship with J.D. experience friction when J.D. and Carla share a drunken kiss. Dr. Cox and Jordan learn that their divorce was not final, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> all good news. Elliot is still angry with J.D. for breaking her heart, and the situation becomes more uncomfortable still when she dates J.D.'s brother.
