Constructed between 1875 and 1877, it {{followed}} the same route across the Nullarbor and along the Great Australian Bight, after John Forrest retraced Eyre's route in 1870 and confirmed its suitability. Repeater stations were installed at Port Lincoln, Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Fowlers Bay, Eucla, Israelite Bay, Esperance, and Bremer Bay. Stations were later added at Franklin Harbour (Cowell) in 1885, Yardea in 1896, and Balladonia in 1897.|$|E
5|$|After Hull's death, {{the people}} of Shangani {{organised}} {{the construction of a}} memorial in his honour—a granite plinth to which a brass plaque was affixed commemorating the pilot's service and bravery. This monument was completed {{before the end of the}} war and erected alongside the main road between Bulawayo and Gwelo, near the bridge over the Shangani River. A memorial to the actions of Hull, Falkson and Lydekker at Bodø was built at the town's airport <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later,</b> and inaugurated on 17 June 1977 with the Norwegian Minister of Defence, Rolf Arthur Hansen, in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later.</b> There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|David Livingstone, {{who visited}} Feira in 1856, {{described}} it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the ramshackle monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later,</b> the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, {{and out of the}} control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the imperial forces from Sicily resulted in the rapid collapse of the imperial position there. Under Maniakes, the Byzantines had conquered the eastern portion of the island, but by 1042, only Messina remained in Byzantine hands. On the mainland, Boioannes did not fare better than his predecessor, as he was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of Montepeloso in September. This succession of defeats signalled {{the beginning of the}} end for Byzantine rule in southern Italy, a process which was completed <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later</b> with the fall of Bari to the Normans under Robert Guiscard.|$|E

5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944. The boat was then {{handed over to the}} Italian Social Republic where it saw service with the Tenth Flotilla performing reconnaissance and landing saboteurs. At some point between September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as nipper in English, the boat was overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for future use, which eventually materialized {{in the form of the}} Una-class midget submarines <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later.</b> Depending on the source, the exact time Mališan was decommissioned differs from the early 1950s to 1957.|$|E
5|$|Marmarosa {{returned}} to Pittsburgh due to health reasons in 1948. He began performing much less frequently, {{and had a}} presence only locally for around a decade. Friends and fellow musicians had commented from an early stage that Marmarosa was an unusual character. His mental stability was probably affected by being beaten into a coma when in his teens, by a short-lived marriage followed by permanent separation from his children, and by a traumatic period in the army. He made comeback recordings in the early 1960s, but soon retreated to Pittsburgh, where he played occasionally into the early 1970s. From then until his death <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later,</b> he lived with family and in veterans' hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later</b> in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E

5000|$|The Century also {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} publish excerpts from the manuscript of a biography of President Abraham Lincoln written by his former secretaries John Hay and John G. Nicolay. The result was a series titled Abraham Lincoln: A History, which ran over <b>three</b> years. <b>Decades</b> <b>later,</b> The Century would return to Abraham Lincoln {{as a symbol of}} the republic's lost virtue. The February 1909 issue had a drawing of Lincoln on its cover and included twenty-two portraits of the former president within its pages along with pictures of his life mask and a cast of his hands. Gilder's contribution to the issue, [...] "Lincoln the Leader", held the subject up as an ideal for modern statesmen to emulate.|$|R
5|$|Pierce {{sought to}} run a more {{efficient}} and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later.</b> The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand {{the role of the}} U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.|$|E
5|$|The massive Islamic {{invasions of}} the mid-7th century began a long {{struggle}} between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost {{the lands of}} the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean, the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later,</b> in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it. In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States. Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticised the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I. Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.|$|E

40|$|Nanostructured {{conjugated}} organic {{thin films}} are essential {{building blocks for}} highly integrated organic devices. We demonstrate the large-area fabrication of an array of well-ordered 15 nm wide conducting polymer nanowires by using an etch mask consisting of self-assembled patterns of cylinder-forming poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) diblock copolymer confined in topographic templates. The poly(3, 4 -ethylenedi-oxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) nanowires operated as an ethanol vapor sensor, suggesting that the electronic properties of the organic film were preserved during the patterning processes. The higher sensitivity to ethanol vapor, compared to an unpatterned film with the same thickness, was attributed to the enhanced surface-to-volume ratio of the nanowire array.
