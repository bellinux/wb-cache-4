40|$|Masters Research - Masters of PhilosophyINTRODUCTION: Level III dosimetric intercomparison studies {{test the}} entire {{radiotherapy}} patient treatment chain from diagnostic imaging to treatment delivery and verification imaging at multiple radiotherapy centres. The anthropomorphic phantom employed in an intercomparison needs to meet specific criteria including portability, tissue equivalence and accommodation of radiation detectors to ensure clinical relevance and dosimetric accuracy. The proposition that a purpose-built phantom can encompass all the attributes necessary for precise Level III dosimetric intercomparisons {{for prostate cancer}} is the premise of this body of work. METHODS: Organ outlines were generated from a human computed tomography image set and incorporated into the phantom design to replicate human anatomy as closely as possible. Twenty-five points of interest were located throughout the dataset to identify where point-dose values could be measured with <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeters.</b> The centre of the prostate was identified as the location for measurement with a small-volume ionization chamber. The materials used in this phantom were tested against water to determine relative attenuation, density and Hounsfield Units. Three materials were chosen to mimic bone, organs, and a backfill material and the phantom was manufactured using modern prototyping techniques into five separate coronal slices. Time lines and resource requirements for the phantom design and manufacture were recorded. The ability of the phantom to mimic the entire treatment chain was tested at the Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital. RESULTS: The phantom CT images indicated the densities and organ geometries were comparable to the original patient. The phantom proved simple to load for dosimetry and rapid to assemble. Measurements indicated the reproducibility {{to be in the}} order of 1 % for the ionization chamber measurement and within 3 % for <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeters.</b> Due to heat release during manufacture, small airgaps were present throughout the phantom producing artifacts on lateral images. The overall cost for production of the prototype phantom was comparable to other commercial anthropomorphic phantoms ($AU 45, 000). The phantom was shown to be suitable for use as a “patient” to mimic the entire treatment chain for typical external beam radiotherapy for prostate and rectal cancer. Outlining of relevant structures by a radiation oncologist was uncomplicated and the computerised treatment plan compared well with the dose measured using ionisation chambers and <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeters.</b> DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The phantom constructed for the present study incorporates all characteristics necessary for accurate Level III intercomparison studies and will be an effective tool for an intercomparison of pelvic treatments in Australasia. These results may benefit analysis of outcomes for prostate cancer treatments, especially in the clinical trial environment.

Exposed radiation doses were measured in pathologic technologist, nuclear medicine technologist, and nuclear medicine physician using a <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeter</b> (TLD) during one month. We also measured the residual radioactivities or absorbed dose rates, the exposure distance and time during procedure, the radiation dose of the waste and the ambient equivalent dose of the pathology laboratory. Results: Actual exposed doses were 0. 21 and 0. 85 (uSv/study) for the whole body and hand of pathology technologist after 47 sentinel node pathologic preparations were performed.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine observed dose in target volume and normal tissues such as lung in breast cancer therapy after mastectomy. Methods: The phantom was designed based on the chest wall computed tomography (CT) images after mastectomy and treatment planning software. Two linear accelerator (Neptune 10 and Saturn 20) machines were used to deliver electron beams at a dose of 200 cGy (10 and 13 MeV). Dose measurements were done using <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeter</b> lithium fluoride chips (TLD- 100 : LiF: Mg; Tl). Findings: The percentage of measured dose in internal mammary nodes, axillary nodes, and chest wall using 13 MeV was found to be 97. 5, 96, and 98, respectively. In treatment with 10 MeV electron, this values changed to 99. 7, 90. 5, and 77 percent, respectively. The anterior lung percentage dose was 78 with 13 MeV electrons while the posterior part of lung received 47 percent with 10 MeV electron beam. Dose values for anterior and posterior part of lung changed to 83 and 45 percent, respectively. Conclusion: Using 13 MeV, internal mammary and axillary lymph nodes as well as the chest wall received adequate doses but lung received excessive dose. Using 10 MeV, internal mammary nodes and chest wall were well exposed to radiation, but axillary lymph nodes did not receive enough dose. Therefore, this dose shortage should be compensated by additional posterior fields using radiation therapy with photon energies. © 2017, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

Also, a partial model of the photostimulated thermoluminescence process is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{characterization}} and {{the study}} of the radiations on their interaction with or-ganic matter is of great interest in view of the human exploration on Mars. The Ionizing RAdiation Sensor (IRAS) selected in the frame of the ExoMars/Pasteur ESA mission is a lightweight particle spectrometer combining various techniques of radiation detection in space. It characterizes the first time the radiation environment on the Mars surface, and provide dose and dose equivalent rates as precursor information absolutely necessary to develop ways to mitigate the radiation risks for future human exploration on Mars. The Martian radiation levels are much higher than those found on Earth and they are relatively low for space. Measurements on the surface will show if they are similar or not to those seen in orbit (modified by the presence of “albedo ” neutrons produced in the regolith and by the thin Martian atmosphere). IRAS consists of a telescope based on segmented silicon detectors of about 40 mm diameter and 300 m thickness, a segmented organic scintillator, and of a <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeter.</b> The telescope will continuously monitor temporal variation of the particle count rate, the dose rate, particle and LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectra. Tissue equivalent BC 430 scintillator material will be used to measure the neutron dose. Neutrons are selected by a criteria requiring no signal in the anti-coincidence. Last, the passive thermolumines-cence dosimeter, based on LiF:Mg detectors, regardless the on board operation timing, will measure the total dose accumulated during the exposure period and due to β and γ radiation, with a responsivity very close to that of a human tissue.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to measure the peripheral dose (PD) with diode and <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeter</b> (TLD) for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with linear accelerator (conventional LINAC), and tomotherapy (novel LINAC). Ten patients each were selected from Trilogy dual-energy and from Hi-Art II tomotherapy. Two diodes were kept at 20 and 25 cm from treatment field edge. TLDs (LiF:MgTi) were also kept at same distance. TLDs were also kept at 5, 10, and 15 cm from field edge. The TLDs were read with REXON reader. The readings at the respective distance were recorded for both diode and TLD. The PD was estimated by taking the ratio of measured dose at the particular distance to the prescription dose. PD was then compared with diode and TLD for LINAC and tomotherapy. Mean PD for LINAC with TLD and diode was 2. 52 cGy (SD 0. 69), 2. 07 cGy (SD 0. 88) at 20 cm, respectively, while at 25 cm, it was 1. 94 cGy (SD 0. 58) and 1. 5 cGy (SD 0. 75), respectively. Mean PD for tomotherapy with TLD and diode was 1. 681 cGy SD 0. 53) and 1. 58 (SD 0. 44) at 20 cm, respectively. The PD was 1. 24 cGy (SD 0. 42) and 1. 088 cGy (SD 0. 35) at 25 cm, respectively, for tomotherapy. Overall, PD from tomotherapy was found lower than LINAC by the factor of 1. 2 - 1. 5. PD measurement is essential to find out the potential of secondary cancer. PD for both (conventional LINAC) and novel LINACs (tomotherapy) were measured and compared with each other. The comparison of the values for PD presented in this work and those published in the literature is difficult because of the different experimental conditions. The diode and TLD readings were reproducible and both the detector readings were comparable...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In 2008, a {{national}} intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry intercomparison {{was carried out}} for all 23 radiation oncology institutions in Switzerland. It was the aim to check the treatment chain focused on the planning, dose calculation, and irradiation process. Methods: A thorax phantom with inhomogeneities was used, in which <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeter</b> (TLD) and ionization chamber measurements were performed. Additionally, absolute dosimetry of the applied beams has been checked. Altogether, 30 plan-measurement combinations {{have been used in}} the comparison study. The results have been grouped according to dose calculation algorithms, classified as ``type a`` or ``type b,`` as proposed by Knoos et al. [``Comparison of dose calculation algorithms for treatment planning in external photon beam therapy for clinical situations,`` Phys. Med. Biol. 51, 5785 - 5807 (2006) ]. Results: Absolute dosimetry check under standard conditions: The mean ratio between the dose derived from the single field measurement and the stated dose, calculated with the treatment planning system, was 1. 007 +/- 0. 010 for the ionization chamber and 1. 002 +/- 0. 014 (mean +/- standard deviation) for the TLD measurements. IMRT Plan Check: In the lung tissue of the planning target volume, a significantly better agreement between measurements (TLD, ionization chamber) and calculations is shown for type b algorithms than for type a (p > 0. 001). In regions outside the lungs, the absolute differences between TLD measured and stated dose values, relative to the prescribed dose, vertical bar(D-m - D-s) / D-prescribed vertical bar, are 1. 9 +/- 0. 4 % and 1. 4 +/- 0. 3 %, respectively. These data show the same degree of accuracy between the two algorithm types if low-density medium is not present. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the performed intercomparison is feasible and confirm the calculation accuracies of type a and type b algorithms in a water equivalent and low-density environment. It is now planned to offer the intercomparison on a regular basis to all Swiss institutions using IMRT techniques. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

40|$|A new {{thermoluminescence}} {{dosimetry system}} for environmental applications was tested, which used high sensitivity lithium fluoride (TLD- 100 H). The energy {{response of the}} bare <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>dosimeters</b> (TLDs) was measured for photon beams with mean energies from 24 keV to 1. 1 MeV, {{and the results were}} compared with standard lithium fluoride (TLD- 100). The energy response was also measured for TLD- 100 H card-mounted dosimeters encapsulated in Teflon RTM, used as part of the Harshaw Type 8855 environmental dosimeter. The EGSnrc Monte Carlo system was used to calculate the dose to the TLDs in both the bare chip holder and the 8855 dosimeter, in order to calculate the thermoluminescence per unit of absorbed dose to the TLDs. The results were broadly consistent with existing data, with the response of both TLD materials correlating with the ionization density of the photon beams...|$|R
