50|$|Three-dimensional {{lift and}} the {{occurrence}} of wingtip vortices can be approached {{with the concept of}} horseshoe vortex and described accurately with the Lanchester-Prandtl theory. In this view, the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> is a continuation of the wing-bound vortex inherent to the lift generation.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the vorticity in the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> wake there is vorticity in the wing's boundary layer, which is often called the bound vorticity and which connects the trailing sheets from {{the two sides of}} the wing into a vortex system in the general form of a horseshoe. The horseshoe form of the vortex system was recognized by the British aeronautical pioneer Lanchester in 1907.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} altering the formation and decay of aircraft <b>trailing</b> <b>vortexes</b> through aerodynamic means, the test capabilities of two wind tunnels and two towing basins were used. The facilities, common models, and measurement techniques that were employed {{in the evaluation of}} vortex minimization concepts are described...|$|R
40|$|Exploratory {{concepts}} are described which were investigated {{to achieve a}} reduction in the vortex induced rolling upsets produced by heavy aircraft <b>trailing</b> <b>vortexes.</b> The initial tests included the use of mass injection, oscillating devices, wingtip shape design, interacting multiple vortexes, and end plates. Although later refinements of some of these concepts were successful, initial test results did not indicate a capability of these concepts to significantly alter the vortex induced rolling upset on a following aircraft...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} the dominant, or most unstable, wave mode for the flow in a <b>trailing</b> line <b>vortex.</b> This dominant mode {{is found to}} reside in a wavenumber regime between that of inviscid wave modes and the viscous upper branch neutral wave modes. A reevaluation of the growth rate {{in the vicinity of}} the upper branch of the curve of neutral stability allows us to predict the neutral value of the azimuthal and axial wavenumber as a function of the imposed swirl within the <b>trailing</b> line <b>vortex.</b> James P. Denier and Jillian A. K. Stot...|$|R
50|$|A canard delta {{foreplane}} creates its own <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex.</b> If this vortex {{interferes with}} the vortex of the main delta wing, this can adversely affect the airflow over the wing and cause unwanted and even dangerous behaviour. In the close-coupled configuration, the canard vortex couples with the main vortex to enhance its benefits and maintain controlled airflow through {{a wide range of}} speeds and angles of attack. This allows both improved manoeuvrability and lower stalling speeds, but the presence of the foreplane can increase drag at supersonic speeds and hence reduce the aircraft's maximum speed.|$|E
50|$|In aerodynamics, {{the lift}} {{distribution}} over a finite wing may {{be approximated by}} assuming that each segment of the wing has a semi-infinite <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> behind it. It is then possible to solve for {{the strength of the}} vortices using the criterion that there be no flow induced through the surface of the wing. This procedure is called the vortex panel method of computational fluid dynamics. The strengths of the vortices are then summed to find the total approximate circulation about the wing. According to the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, lift is the product of circulation, airspeed, and air density.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between equilibrium and frozen {{is important because}} it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. Thermal protection shield (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.|$|E

40|$|This {{piece of}} work deals with the viscous {{stability}} of <b>trailing</b> line <b>vortex.</b> The perturbations are three dimensional and the viscous effects were encountered. The eigenvalue problem was solved by implementing a pseudo-spectral approach in MATLAB environment. The code was confirmed through comparing the results with those available in the literature, produced with Bachelor’s vortex model as base flow. The code was afterwards used to investigate the stability of <b>trailing</b> line <b>vortex</b> where the azimuthal component of the base flow was the one of Vatistas’ vortex model. The stability of the linear modes (Kelvin’s waves) was investigated for axisymmetric and asymmetric disturbances. Results for the temporal viscous unstable modes were provided. The influence of swirl parameter and Reynolds number on the growth rate, phase speed and amplitude, of the perturbations were studied. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} periodic disturbances on <b>vortex</b> <b>trails</b> is considered. In addition to following small initial perturbations, large amplitude initial disturbances of the <b>vortex</b> <b>trails</b> are also studied. It is {{shown that the}} equations support a rich variety of essentially nonlinear solutions including unbounded and quasisteady ones. These solutions are found to correspond to various modes of vortex clustering in the physical plane. At {{the close of the}} paper, comparisons of these results with recent numerical and experimental findings on the wakes behind stationary cylinders, and also transversely oscillating bluff objects, are made...|$|R
50|$|When the {{airplane}} produces lift, another drag component results. Induced drag, symbolized , {{is due to}} a modification of the pressure distribution due to the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> system that accompanies the lift production. An alternative perspective on lift and drag is gained from considering the change of momentum of the airflow. The wing intercepts the airflow and forces the flow to move downward. This results in an equal and opposite force acting upward on the wing which is the lift force. The change of momentum of the airflow downward results in a reduction of the rearward momentum of the flow which {{is the result of a}} force acting forward on the airflow and applied by the wing to the air flow; an equal but opposite force acts on the wing rearward which is the induced drag. Induced drag tends to be the most important component for airplanes during take-off or landing flight. Another drag component, namely wave drag, , results from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds. The shock waves induce changes in the boundary layer and pressure distribution over the body surface.|$|E

A yawhead pressure probe was used in a subsonic wind tunnel to obtain detailed mean flow measurements at stations up to 30 chordlengths downstream in an aircraft <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex.</b> Mass injection at the wingtip was shown to hasten the decay of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex.</b> A theoretical method is presented to show the effect which the circulation distribution on the wing has {{on the structure of}} the outer portion of the vortex...|$|E
40|$|We do {{not accept}} Uberoi’s grounds for his {{statement}} that turbulent line vortices do not exist. They are based on experiments on a <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex.</b> (1) In Ref. 2, we have presented {{the conditions under which}} a turbulent <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> may be approximated by a turbulent line vortex. These conditions are not satisfied by Uberoi’s experiment...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons of {{measured}} and calculated aerodynamic {{behavior of a}} tiltrotor model are presented. The test of the Tilt Rotor Aeroacoustic Model (TRAM) with a single, 1 / 4 -scale V- 22 rotor in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW) provides an extensive set of aeroacoustic, performance, and structural loads data. The calculations were performed using the rotorcraft comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II. Presented are comparisons of {{measured and}} calculated performance and airloads for helicopter mode operation, as well as calculated induced and profile power. An aerodynamic and wake model and calculation procedure that reflects the unique geometry and phenomena of tiltrotors has been developed. There are major differences between this model and the corresponding aerodynamic and wake model that has been established for helicopter rotors. In general, good correlation between measured and calculated performance and airloads behavior has been shown. Two aspects of the analysis that clearly need improvement are the stall delay model and the <b>trailed</b> <b>vortex</b> formation model...|$|R
5000|$|The first aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 {{registered}} N905NA, {{was originally}} manufactured for American Airlines and still carried visible American cheatlines while testing Enterprise in the 1970s. It was acquired in 1974 and initially used for <b>trailing</b> wake <b>vortex</b> research {{as part of}} a broader study by NASA Dryden, as well as Shuttle tests involving an F-104 flying in close formation and simulating a [...] "release" [...] from the 747.|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{dispersion}} of two-dimensional <b>trailed</b> <b>vortex</b> pairs within simplified neutral atmospheric backgrounds is studied numerically for three conditions: when the pair is imbedded {{in a constant}} turbulent bath (constant dissipation); when the pair is subjected to a mean cross-wind shear; and when the pair is near the ground. Turbulent transport is modeled using second-order closure turbulent transport theory. The turbulent background fields are constructed using a superequilibrium approximation. The computed results allow several general conclusions to be drawn {{with regard to the}} reduction in circulation of the vortex pair and the rolling moment induced on a following aircraft: (1) the rate of decay of a vortex pair increases with increasing background dissipation rate; (2) cross-wind shear disperses the vortex whose vorticity is opposite to the background; and (3) the proximity of a ground plane reduces the hazard of the pair by scrubbing. The phenomenon of vortex bounce is explained in terms of secondary vorticity produced at the ground plane. Qualitative comparisons are made with available experimental data, and inferences of these results upon the persistence of aircraft trailing vortices are discussed...|$|R

A procedure for analyzing the 3 D-velocity field is presented that includes a method for accounting for vortex wander. The results show that a vortex generator can alter the trajectory of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> and that a major change in the size and intensity of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex</b> can be achieved by introducing a high level of turbulence into the core of the vortex...|$|E
40|$|Primarily an {{experimental}} effort, this study {{focuses on the}} velocity and vorticity fields in the near wake of a hovering rotor. Drag terminology is reviewed, and the theory for separately determining the profile-and-induced-drag components from wake quantities is introduced. Instantaneous visualizations of the flow field are used to center the laser velocimeter (LV) measurements on the vortex core and to assess {{the extent of the}} positional mandering of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex.</b> Velocity profiles obtained at different rotor speeds and distances behind the rotor blade clearly indicate the position, size, and rate of movement of the wake sheet and the core of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex.</b> The results also show the distribution of vorticity along the wake sheet and within the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortex...</b>|$|E

The HART rotor was a 40 %, Mach-scaled model of the hingeless BO- 105 main rotor. Two wake models used in the comprehensive analysis are the single-trailer and the multiple-trailer free-wake models.

40|$|Time-resolved {{velocity}} field measurements {{in the wake}} of the flapping wings of the DelFly II Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) in forward flight configuration were obtained by Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (Stereo-PIV). The PIV measurements were performed at several spanwise planes {{in the wake of}} the flapping wings and at a high framing rate to allow a reconstruction of the temporal development of the three dimensional wake structures throughout the flapping cycle. The wake reconstruction was performed by interpolating between the measurement planes through a Kriging interpolation procedure. First, the general wake topology of the DelFly II model is described in conjunction with the behavior of the distinctive flow structures, in particular, tip <b>vortex,</b> <b>trailing</b> edge <b>vortex,</b> and root vortex. Second, the effect of reduced frequency is investigated by changing the flapping frequency. Comparison of the three dimensional wake structures for different cases of reduced frequency reveals major differences in both formation and interaction of vortical structures.
