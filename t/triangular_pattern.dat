Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or <b>triangular</b> <b>pattern</b> instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E

500|$|Sapphires are a color {{variety of}} corundum, a {{crystalline}} form of aluminium oxide (...) [...] Corundum {{is one of}} the hardest minerals, rating9 on the Mohs scale. Corundum gems of most colors are called sapphires, except for red ones, which are called rubies. The term [...] "Yogo sapphire" [...] refers only to sapphires from the Yogo Gulch. [...] The cornflower blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of iron and titanium. Yogo sapphires are unique in that they are free of cavities and inclusions, have high uniform clarity, lack color zoning, and do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep. Unlike Asian sapphires, they maintain their brilliance in artificial light. Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters: since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an igneous bedrock rather than in sedimentary alluvial deposits where most other sapphires are located, they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape, making cutting much easier, as does their lack of inclusions, color zoning, or cloudiness. Yogos also exhibit a <b>triangular</b> <b>pattern</b> on the basal plane of the flattened crystals, with thin rhombohedral crystal faces, a feature absent in sapphires from other parts of Montana.|$|E

These lost inscriptions are partly known from graphical documentation made by King Stanislaus Augustus's court painter, Johann Christoph Werner, in 1764 and by Jacek Przybylski in 1792. One of the plates had already been broken by that time with only part of the inscription preserved: Liste est glaud... h Bolezlai Duc... ("This is a sword of... Duke Boleslaus..."); the inscription on the other plate continued: Cum quo ei Dn SOS [...] auxiletur adsus partes amen ("With whom is the Omnipotent Lord and Savior, to help him against his enemies. Amen"). The missing part of the first inscription is only known from an old replica of Szczerbiec which once belonged to the Radziwiłł family (see Historical replicas below). The full inscription read: Iste est gladius Principis et haeredis Boleslai Ducis Poloniae et Masoviae, Lanciciae ("This is a sword of Hereditary Prince Boleslaus, Duke of Poland, Masovia, and Łęczyca"). The identity of this Duke Boleslaus is uncertain.|$|E

Togetic's torso retains the same red and blue <b>triangular</b> <b>patterns</b> it had on its shell as a Togepi, but it gains a visible neck and its fairy-inspired appearance is more accentuated due to gaining a pair of stubby wings and an all-white coloration. Its second and final evolution is Togekiss, which requires a Togetic to be exposed to a Shiny Stone in order to evolve. Togekiss retains the red and blue <b>triangular</b> <b>patterns</b> and fairy-inspired appearance seen in its previous forms, but it noticeably shows a slight avian body shape as well. Unlike its previous forms, Togekiss debuted two generations after them in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.|$|R

The runways used the standard <b>triangular</b> <b>pattern.</b> The main, east-west runway was [...] long, with a designated alignment of 28/10, {{and the others were}} [...] aligned 21/03 and [...] aligned 34/16. The first aircraft to land was a Luftwaffe Ju 88 at 06.20 on 24 July 1941.

2500|$|A 1983 Omni article says [...] "Colonel Ted Conrad {{the base}} commander... recalls five Air Force policemen spotted lights {{from what they}} thought was a small plane {{descending}} into the forest. Two of the men tracked the object on foot and came upon a large tripod-mounted craft. It had no windows but was studded with brilliant red and blue lights. Each time the men came within 50 yards of the ship, Conrad relates, it levitated six feet in the air and backed away. They followed it for almost an hour through the woods and across a field until it took off at 'phenomenal speed.' Acting on the reports made by his men, Colonel Conrad began a brief investigation of the incident in the morning.

30|$|To {{overcome}} the problems listed above, we suggest utilizing a bigger sphere {{to improve the}} size uniformity. A bigger sphere also means longer physical cross section of triangles, which will enhance the sensing performance of triangles. Our suggested structure contains three layers: the top Au layer and middle SiO 2 layers are overlapping <b>triangular</b> <b>patterns,</b> while the bottom layer is Au reflection film, which can be fabricated by utilizing a microsphere array mask. We investigate the resonance absorption mechanism of the proposed structure, the gap size between adjacent tips of <b>triangular</b> <b>patterns,</b> and the thicknesses of SiO 2 layer and Au layer influence on the position and amplitude of absorption peak. Lastly, optimization structure parameters are chosen, and we calculate the sensing properties of the structure. The obtained results of RIS and FOM are 660  nm/RIU and FOM 132, respectively, which are much better than former reports.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} hexagonal global parameterization, a {{new type}} of surface parameterization in which parameter lines respect six-fold rotational symmetries (6 -RoSy). Such parameterizations enable the tiling of surfaces with nearly regular hexagonal or <b>triangular</b> <b>patterns,</b> and can be used for triangular remeshing. Our framework to construct a hexagonal parameterization, referred to as HEXCOVER, extends the QUADCOVER algorithm and formulates necessary conditions for hexagonal parameterization. We also provide an algorithm to automatically generate a 6 -RoSy field that respects directional and singularity features in the surface. We demonstrate the usefulness of our geometry-aware global parameterization with applications such as surface tiling with nearly regular textures and geometry patterns, as well as triangular and hexagonal remeshing. Index Terms—Surface parameterization, rotational symmetry, hexagonal global parameterization, <b>triangular</b> remeshing, <b>pattern</b> synthesis on surfaces, texture synthesis, geometry synthesis, regular patterns. ...|$|R
