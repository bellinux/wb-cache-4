5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces {{attempted}} to envelop the Pusan Perimeter. The 4th and 6th North Korean (NK) Infantry Divisions advanced south {{in a wide}} flanking maneuver. The two divisions were forced to spread their units along a <b>thin</b> <b>line,</b> but managed to penetrate the UN's left flank with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly pushing back US and South Korean forces. American forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance {{in a series of}} engagements in the southern section of the country. The 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, sustained massive casualties at Hadong in a coordinated ambush on July 27 that opened a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan area open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

25|$|Sublimation: If the air {{movement}} in the tunnel is sufficiently non-turbulent, a particle stream released into the airflow will not break up as the air moves along, but stay together as a sharp <b>thin</b> <b>line.</b> Multiple particle streams released from a grid of many nozzles can provide a dynamic three-dimensional shape of the airflow around a body. As with the force balance, these injection pipes and nozzles need to be shaped {{in a manner that}} minimizes the introduction of turbulent airflow into the airstream.|$|E

25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{that made}} her significant {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
25|$|Denton is home {{to several}} annual artistic and {{cultural}} events that cater to residents and tourists. The annual North Texas State Fair and Rodeo began in 1928 and promotes the cowboy culture of Texas. In addition to a rodeo, the event features several local country rock performances, pageants, and food contests. Hosted by the North Texas State Fairgrounds since 1948, the fair brings in over 150,000 people during its nine-day run. The Denton Municipal Airport has hosted the annual Denton Airshow since 1998. The event includes aerial demonstrations and airplane exhibits; it attracted over 10,000 attendees in 2012. Other events in the city include an annual Redbud Festival, the Fiesta on the Square, and the <b>Thin</b> <b>Line</b> Documentary Film Fest.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, when modern explorers {{discovered}} {{a connection between}} the Flint Ridge Cave system to the northeast and Mammoth Cave, they were astonished to discover that the Mammoth Cave end of the connection was actually indicated as a passage lead on Bishop's map. (It is seen as a long <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> branching off from the eastern end of the Echo River complex.) The construction in 1905 of a dam on the Green River in the interim caused the passage to be flooded (and therefore inaccessibly hidden by murky water) most of the time after the dam's completion, and the passage was rediscovered backwards, from its remote end, by cavers entering the Flint Ridge Cave System. Although he never knew its significance, Bishop had unwittingly shown the key to connecting two major components of the longest cave in the world, 130 years before the connection was made.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, the German Army in {{the east}} was the most {{powerful}} force in the region. Even more importantly, {{it was not only}} undefeated, it was victorious (in contrast to the German Army on the western front). However the commander of the German forces {{in the east}}, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties. He believed, rightly, that his army was the only stabilising influence over the Eastern Europe. Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former Oberkommando-Ostfront (or Ober-Ost) occupation zone became a <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia. The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918. Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons en masse and returned home. Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to explain}} Finn's actions in flirting with Rachel to entice {{her back into}} the glee club, Monteith explained: [...] "Finn is not only strangely {{attracted}} to Rachel, but he respects what she chases after in her life.

500|$|In 1918, American {{astronomer}} Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory {{observed that}} there was no spiral structure in M87 and he noticed a [...] "curious straight ray... apparently connected with the nucleus by a <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> of matter." [...] The ray appeared brightest at the inner end. The following year, a supernova within M87 reached a peak photographic magnitude of 21.5, although this event was not reported until photographic plates were examined by the Russian astronomer Innokentii A. Balanowski in 1922.|$|E

The term “greenwashing” refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits.

500|$|The term PIFA is {{reserved}} by many authors (e.g. Sánchez-Hernández) for the shorted patch antenna where the antenna element is wide {{with the ground}} plane underneath. [...] The <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> type of inverted-F antennae with the ground plane to one side like A and B in the diagram are just called IFA {{even if they are}} in planar format. [...] An author may even call an IFA of this type a printed inverted-F antenna but still reserve PIFA for the shorted patch type (e.g. Hall and Wang.) ...|$|E
500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the <b>thin</b> <b>line</b> type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E
