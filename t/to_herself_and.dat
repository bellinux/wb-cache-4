5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>and</b> the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E

5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E

25|$|Although never {{threatened}} with destitution {{as she continued}} to receive financial support from her mother, Schiaparelli nevertheless {{felt the need to}} earn an independent income. She assisted Man Ray with his Dada magazine Société Anonyme, which proved short lived.

Connected to the French couturier Paul Poiret through her association with his sister Nicole Groult, Picabia proposed that they sell French couture in America.

25|$|Scholars {{view the}} shapeshifting Anyanwu as a fictional {{representation}} of Donna Haraway’s “cyborg” identity {{as defined in}} her 1985 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto.” Specifically, Anyanwu embodies Haraway’s “lived social and bodily realities {{in which people are}} not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints” as her shapeshifting abilities compete with Doro’s genetic engineering. Anyanwu’s hybridity, her capability to represent multiple simultaneous identities, allows her to survive, to have agency, and to remain true <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> her history in the midst of excruciating oppression and change.|$|E

She then suddenly receives news from Longbourn that her sister Lydia had eloped with Mr. Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy immediately and departs in haste, believing she will never see him again, since Lydia's disgrace has ruined the family's good name.|$|E

Eli was the priest of Shiloh, and one of the last Israelite Judges before the rule of kings in ancient Israel. He had assumed the leadership after Samson's death.

25|$|Some {{time before}} October 1563 De Vere's mother married Charles Tyrrell, a Gentleman Pensioner. In May 1565 {{she wrote to}} Cecil, urging that the money from family {{properties}} set aside for de Vere's use during his minority by his father's will should be entrusted <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> other family friends to protect it and ensure {{that he would be}} able to meet the expenses of furnishing his household and suing his livery when he reached his majority; this last would end his wardship though cancelling his debt with that Court, and convey the powers attached to his title. There is no evidence that Cecil ever replied to her request. She died three years later, and was buried beside her first husband at Earls Colne. de Vere's stepfather, Charles Tyrrell, died in March 1570.|$|E
25|$|Eva {{appears at}} a church to take the sacrament {{in front of her}} adoring {{supporters}} ("Santa Evita"), but goes into a trancelike state, beginning to hallucinate. In her vision she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends and silencing people who do not support her, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines ("A Waltz for Eva and Che"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterwards, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she can do for him and his career ("You Must Love Me").|$|E

25|$|Judge McGruder {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} supporting characters in the Judge Dredd strip at the time that the Mechanismo stories were published. Her eccentricity and questionable mental health had been a recurring theme in the background of many Judge Dredd stories ever since the character's reintroduction to the strip in Necropolis over two years earlier. There had been hints of a split personality, a tendency to talk <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>and</b> other odd mannerisms and characteristics, which were primarily used for comic relief. However, in the first three Mechanismo stories McGruder's judgement and suitability for high office were increasingly called into question. This issue rapidly became the focus of the Mechanismo storyline, and was dealt with in a much more serious tone than previous stories had done. As the storyline developed, the emphasis moved away from robots and action, and towards political intrigue and McGruder's paranoia, before reverting to action again as it neared its conclusion.|$|E
25|$|In rural Amhara in 2003/04, {{there were}} strong social and {{cultural}} pressures for girls to marry before they were 14 years old. Virginity before marriage was highly valued and an unmarried girl over 14 year was stigmatized. She was an embarrassment <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> her family and regarded as a financial burden since her contribution to domestic and agricultural activities was not valued. The age of first marriage had been declining since the mothers' average age of marriage was 11 years while their daughters' average age of marriage was 8 years. Early marriage allowed formation of bonds between families and, when families were land rich, it maintained their land holdings. Sons from land poor families, who had {{reached the age of}} 18, could obtain land from the peasants association if they married. There was no need for brides to be 18 and they were often under 11 years old. Boys, but not girls, were expected to be successful at the local school. Success for a girl was as a wife and mother and early marriage provided recognition in the community.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>and</b> hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
