Even <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>of</b> kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any item or implement that has handled chametz is generally put away and not used during Passover.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the crisis two {{solutions}} have been proposed. One, repeatedly supported over the long term by the GAO and others is to consolidate the U.S. financial industry regulators.

Proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have also been made.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings {{is largely}} {{concerned}} with the attempt of Sauron to recover the One and {{the efforts of the}} West to forestall him by destroying it.

Tolkien is not entirely clear about what happened to the other rings, though he implied that the power of any that survived came to an end.

25|$|The One Ring possessed {{something}} of a will of its own. Its only accepted master was Sauron himself, and it would seek to leave any other bearer when it would cause the greatest harm, or when it might return to Sauron. Bilbo warned Frodo of this, and Frodo kept it on a chain {{so that it would}} not slip off unnoticed. In the end, Gollum succumbs to the malevolent influence of the ring, defies Frodo, and takes the ring for himself. While dancing with joy over the recovery of the ring, Gollum falls into <b>the</b> <b>Cracks</b> <b>of</b> Doom in Orodruin, where the ring is destroyed. With the destruction of the Ring, Gandalf explains that Sauron is weakened to the point that he {{will never be able to}} materialize again.|$|E

Frodo and Sam reach the edge of <b>the</b> <b>Cracks</b> <b>of</b> Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself {{and puts it on}} his finger. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. The Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.|$|E

500|$|Three composers {{who made}} {{frequent}} use of tone clusters {{for a wide variety}} of ensembles are Giacinto Scelsi, Alfred Schnittke—both of whom often worked with them in microtonal contexts—and Lou Harrison. Scelsi employed them for much of his career, including in his last large-scale work, Pfhat (1974), which premiered in 1986. They are found in works of Schnittke's ranging from the Quintet for Piano and Strings (1972–76), where [...] "microtonal strings fin tone clusters between <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>of</b> the piano keys," [...] to the choral Psalms of Repentance (1988). Harrison's many pieces featuring clusters include Pacifika Rondo (1963), Concerto for Organ with Percussion (1973), Piano Concerto (1983–85), Three Songs for male chorus (1985), Grand Duo (1988), and Rhymes with Silver (1996).|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round.

What we're really trying to do is show <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>of</b> society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E
500|$|E. H. Carr {{writes of}} Dostoevsky's {{character}} the young student Raskolnikov {{in the novel}} Crime and Punishment who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender {{on the principle of}} transcending conventional morals: [...] "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken conscience (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man." [...] Hermann Hesse wrote his Siddhartha to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his conscience on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all things could be unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic The Lord of the Rings describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in conscience to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in <b>the</b> <b>Cracks</b> <b>of</b> Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird (film))) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.|$|E
