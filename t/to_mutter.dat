500|$|In November 1811, a {{messenger}} brought news to Kentucky of former Kentucky Attorney General Joseph Hamilton Daveiss's {{death at the}} Battle of Tippecanoe, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians. In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 whipping up support for the impending war effort. By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met. On August 14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at Georgetown. He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard <b>to</b> <b>mutter</b> [...] "If it hadn't been for you, I could have gone with the boys myself." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed <b>to</b> <b>mutter</b> on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|The Cleveland premiere on {{the evening}} of April 20, 1953 saw a {{distinguished}} crowd turn out. When the stage backdrop failed to come down on time, Hammerstein was heard <b>to</b> <b>mutter,</b> [...] "Damn and damn and damn! This is a new way: they saved it for the performance!" [...] Nevertheless, the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome. The Cleveland critics thought well of the show, but were concerned about the weak story. After the Cleveland reactions and problems, according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, [...] "what had seemed to be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble". Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and [...] "there just wasn't the same energy". Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture, with the audience to watch, after the curtain rose, a blank stage on which the play-within-the-play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations. Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening, the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show's overture; in response, the duo abandoned Hammerstein's concept and opened with an overture.|$|E

500|$|Puccini asked {{clerical}} {{friends for}} {{words for the}} congregation <b>to</b> <b>mutter</b> {{at the start of}} the act 1 Te Deum; when nothing they provided satisfied him, he supplied the words himself. For the Te Deum music, he investigated the melodies to which the hymn was set in Roman churches, and sought to reproduce the cardinal's procession authentically, even to the uniforms of the Swiss Guards. He adapted the music to the exact pitch of the great bell of St. Peter's Basilica, and was equally diligent when writing the music that opens act 3, in which Rome awakens to the sounds of church bells. He journeyed to Rome and went to the Castel Sant'Angelo to measure the sound of matins bells there, as they would be heard from its ramparts. Puccini had bells for the Roman dawn cast to order by four different foundries. This apparently did not have its desired effect, as Illica wrote to Ricordi on the day after the premiere, [...] "the great fuss and the large amount of money for the bells have constituted an additional folly, because it passes completely unnoticed". Nevertheless, the bells provide a source of trouble and expense to opera companies performing Tosca to this day.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was much}} {{laughter}} {{in the courtroom}} when Cameron began questioning a witness demanding to know why [...] "John Downey" [...] had just answered {{that he had never}} known Whelan, nor lived in Montreal as it was widely known was true. The witness whispered to the judge, who informed counsel that the man called to the witness stand was named John O'Donnell, causing Cameron <b>to</b> <b>mutter</b> [...] "Oh...then you may go down" [...] and excusing him from the court while the actual John Downey was found and sworn in.|$|E

She returns two seasons later as Roy's new girlfriend, though Roy dumps her when she uses their {{relationship}} to get Joe and Helen on her show to ambush them about a momentary slump in their sex life. Antonio is one of her biggest fans. Her budding relationship with Roy causes Antonio <b>to</b> <b>mutter,</b> [...] "But.....she's Mary Pat Lee....and he's.....Roy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Glove Slap" [...] is {{a parody}} of the song [...] "Love Shack". The B-52's sang both the {{original}} and the amended version used in the episode. The music playing during the sequence where the Simpsons begin farming is the theme tune from the television series Green Acres. The addicted animals attempting {{to break into the}} house to obtain the last Tomacco is a reference the film Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the zombies' attack. A farmer is shown using an elephant to measure his corn plants' height; this is a reference to the song [...] "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'" [...] in the musical Oklahoma!, which features the line [...] "the corn is as high an elephant's eye". The Southern colonel's accent is similar to the Warner Bros. character Foghorn Leghorn and he uses Foghorn's phrase [...] "Sir, I say sir!", while the mudflap on his RV features a picture of him in a similar pose to Warner Bros. character Yosemite Sam. Additionally, his horn plays the opening few notes of the song [...] "Dixie". [...] Coincidentally, in the Warner Bros. short Duck Amuck (originally released in 1953), Daffy Duck happens <b>to</b> <b>mutter,</b> [...] "E-I, e, i, d'oh...?" ...|$|E
2500|$|French's term {{of office}} saw the {{suppression}} in 1916 of the Easter Rising, which briefly coincided with a German invasion scare. An intelligence report on 21 April warned of collaboration between the Irish and the Germans, causing French <b>to</b> <b>mutter</b> [...] "I don't believe a word of it". French received news of the insurrection at noon on 24 April 1916 (Easter Monday), and at once sent two infantry brigades to Ireland and put other formations on standby—the Admiralty warned that the German fleet was out. Woken at 4am on 25 April {{with the news that}} the Germans were shelling Lowestoft, French ordered the commanders of the two Home Defence Armies to prepare for action and ordered two divisions in the Midlands to be prepared to move to the coast. Later that day he was informed that Macready had been deputed to handle the War Office's side of the Irish uprising. [...] French rejected Kitchener's suggestion that he go to Ireland that very evening and take personal command, a decision with which the Prime Minister concurred (despite their previous antagonism, French recorded that Kitchener [...] "expressed no annoyance at my visit to the PM!"). The military authorities reported from Dublin that they had the situation well in hand.|$|E

60|$|I {{wanted to}} see the man, after hearing all this. He was thirty-four years old, and looked sixty. He sat upon a squared block of stone, with his head bent down, his forearms resting on his knees, his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face, and he was <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself. He raised his chin and looked us slowly over, in a {{listless}} dull way, blinking with the distress of the torchlight, then dropped his head and fell <b>to</b> <b>muttering</b> again and took no further notice of us. There were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present. On his wrists and ankles were cicatrices, old smooth scars, and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground, and was thick with rust. Chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner.|$|R
