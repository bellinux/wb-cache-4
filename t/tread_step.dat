50|$|A {{treadmill}} is {{a device}} generally for walking or running or climbing while {{staying in the}} same place. Treadmills were introduced before the development of powered machines, to harness the power of animals or humans to do work, often a type of mill that was operated by a person or animal <b>treading</b> <b>steps</b> of a treadwheel to grind grain. In later times, treadmills were used as punishment devices for people sentenced to hard labour in prisons. The terms treadmill and treadwheel were used interchangeably for the power and punishment mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is likely}} that foveal {{information}} on treads provides important sensory cues for stair walking, it is unclear how gaze stabilization on treads contribute to gait control on stairs. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which (i) stair walking depends on foveal information on <b>stepped</b> <b>treads,</b> (ii) fixated treads correspond to future foot landing locations, and (iii) the distance looked ahead varies with stepping distance. Gaze and foot position was monitored from six healthy young adults when they ascended and descended a 10 tread long staircase, taking the stairs one or two treads at a time. The results showed that 55 - 68 % of the total fixation time was aimed at treads, and that tread edges were fixated more intensively during stair descent (69 % of the total time spent fixating treads) than during stair ascent (48 %). A substantial 28 - 34 % of the <b>stepped</b> <b>treads</b> was never fixated and, when the staircase was taken two treads a time, approximately 35 % of the fixated <b>treads</b> was never <b>stepped</b> on. Subjects fixated 3. 5 - 4. 5 treads ahead in both stepping conditions, but when the staircase was taken 2 <b>treads</b> a time, <b>stepped</b> <b>treads</b> were fixated shorter ahead (2. 7 - 2. 9 treads) than treads that were not stepped (3. 4 - 4. 1 treads). These results provide new insights into the visual control of stair walking, and suggest that the stabilization of gaze on treads is not used solely to guide foot placement, but may serve other purposes as well, e. g., to facilitate postural control on the staircase.

5000|$|The {{stringer}} in {{this example}} has two pieces of tread stock. This allows for a slight overhang. There is also a space in between the boards.

The moonlight flickered down athwart the trackless soil as they went; the hum of insects innumerable droned deep along the underbrush. Now and then the startled scream of a night jar broke the monotony of the buzz that was worse than silence; owls boomed from the hollow trees, and fireflies darted dim through the open spaces. At last they emerged upon the cleared area of the temple. There Felix, without one moment's hesitation, with a firm and resolute <b>tread,</b> <b>stepped</b> over the white coral line that marked the taboo of the great god's precincts.

50|$|The new piazza {{in front}} of the two new {{buildings}} was below street level, and steps were constructed on two sides.
