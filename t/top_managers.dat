25|$|Hedge fund {{management}} {{firms are}} usually owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits {{that the business}} makes. As management fees are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, performance fees (and any excess management fees) are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits. Funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by <b>top</b> <b>managers</b> tend to be estimates based on {{factors such as the}} fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them. Many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the role of leadership, vision and {{motivation}} of the employees (empowerment) in order to get a better understanding of how the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> of a Born Global company can develop the company. The study is based on two explorative case studies, where interviews have been conducted with both the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> as well as the employees. This study is considered crucial in case of born global where the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> spends maximum time in travelling. <b>Top</b> <b>manager</b> needs to integrate such a culture where employees are set in a framework wherein the operations are handled smoothly during the absence of <b>top</b> <b>manager.</b> In this era of global competition the key for a successful firm lies in the empowerment of employees with well defined boundaries. A qualitative strategy and a research design with two case studies on Swedish Born Global companies were used in reaching the {{purpose of this}} study. The primary empirical data were mainly collected from six interviews. Two interviews were conducted with <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> and rest with employees. Secondary data like general company information were gathered from the website of the companies prior to primary data collection to have a better understanding and preparation. The results of the study indicate that the vision is more important for the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> compared to the employees working in a born global company. However, the vision manages to establish a supportive culture where their daily activities and decisions of the employees are in line with the vision of the company. We see that this has been possible due to the leadership style and motivational factors like delegation of responsibility and autonomy of work. Our findings indicate that empowering employees has a significant advantage supporting the growth and internationalization of the born global company. Based on these findings, practical and theoretical implications are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|R

30|$|The LoS can {{effectively}} reflect the self-selecting process of a <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> as it exhibits his level of {{acceptance of the}} company’s regulations and culture and his loyalty (Pfeffer 1983). The increasing LoS of a <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> enhances organizational cohesion. Similar skills and common cognitive patterns will be easily formed from the theory, beliefs, and experience (Michel and Hambrick 1992; Dikolli et al. 2014), but a long-serving <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> may tend to be satisfied and dependent on the organizational regulations and patterns (Luo et al. 2013).

Even before the department was formally established, Howe's representatives were surveying the country for essential war needs, with the department soon accumulating huge reserves of strategic materials. During the Second World War, Howe established 28Crown Corporations, which did everything from managing secret projects to manufacturing the machine tools the rest of Canadian industry needed to keep going. These corporations were not responsible to Parliament, but to Howe himself. Parliament received no word of their activities unless Howe mentioned them.|$|E
500|$|Most current players wear {{specialist}} football boots, {{which can}} be made either of leather or a synthetic material. Modern boots are cut slightly below the ankles, {{as opposed to the}} high-ankled boots used in former times, and have studs attached to the soles. Studs may be either moulded directly to the sole or be detachable, normally by means of a screw thread. Modern boots such as the Adidas Predator, originally designed by former Liverpool player Craig Johnston, feature increasingly intricate, scientifically aided designs and features such as air pockets in the soles and rubber [...] "blades" [...] on the sole rather than studs. The blades {{have been the subject of}} controversy as several <b>top</b> <b>managers</b> have blamed them for injuries both to opposition players and to the wearers themselves.|$|E
500|$|In 1879, {{a period}} of twenty years of almost {{uninterrupted}} growth came to an end, and the slate industry {{was hit by a}} recession which lasted until the 1890s. Management responded by tightening rules and making it more difficult for the men to take time off. Labour relations were worsened by differences in language, religion and politics between the two sides. The owners and <b>top</b> <b>managers</b> at most of the quarries were English-speaking, Anglican and Tory, while the quarrymen were Welsh-speaking and mainly Nonconformist and Liberal. Negotiations between the two sides usually involved the use of interpreters. In October 1885, there was a dispute at Dinorwig over the curtailing of holidays which led to a lock-out lasting until February 1886. At the Penrhyn Quarry, George Sholto Gordon Douglas-Pennant took over from his father Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant in 1885, and in 1886 appointed E. A. Young as chief manager. A more stringent management regime was introduced, and relations with the workforce deteriorated. This culminated in the suspension of 57 members of the union committee and 17 other men in September 1896, leading to a strike which lasted eleven months. The men were eventually obliged to go back to work, essentially on the management's terms, in August 1897. This strike became known as [...] "The Penrhyn Lockout".|$|E

30|$|The <b>top</b> <b>manager’s</b> {{experience}} in years determines a new method of marketing innovation. A longer time the manager {{stays in the}} enterprises enriches {{the experience of the}} manager in every aspect of the enterprises. It might also provide an opportunity for the manager to deal with the innovation of the enterprise. The manager of the enterprise knows the areas that need improvement, and probably, it is the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> that is exactly keen for the accomplishment of the strategic objective of the enterprise. In this case, the longer the stay of the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> in the enterprise, the more experienced is the manager about the enterprise. It is argued that managers are likely to have better insights into future business opportunities, threats, niche markets, products, technologies, and market development; in this case, top managerial experience is expected to be positively related to innovative activity and its performance. Managerial experience enhances both the propensity to innovate and the innovative firm performance, as measured by the share of sales accounted for by new products (Balsmeier and Czarnitzki 2014). Thus, the experience of the <b>top</b> <b>manager</b> would help peruse marking innovation that helps achieve the objective. However, a study by Yuan et al. (2014) indicated that the top management team’s tenure and firm innovation are negatively related.|$|R
