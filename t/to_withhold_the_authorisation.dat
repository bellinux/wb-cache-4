50|$|At Ostia {{the cult}} of the god, as well as his sacerdos, was the most {{important}} of the town. The sacerdos was named pontifex Vulcani et aedium sacrarum: he had under his jurisdiction all the sacred buildings in town and could give or <b>withhold</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> erect new statues to Eastern divinities. He was chosen for life, perhaps by the council of the decuriones, and his position was the equivalent of the pontifex maximus in Rome.

40|$|We study a model where {{multiple}} sellers {{with limited}} supply strategically choose both the price formation rule and the allocation rule. We show that inefficiency {{in this setting}} arises both because sellers choose <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>the</b> good and because they sell to lower valuation buyers {{despite the presence of}} higher valuation buyers. This contrasts with the findings of the literatures on monopolistic and competing sellers, which suggest that the only form of inefficiency that arises is from sellers choosing <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>the</b> good. Further, we show that both types of inefficiencies vanish as the number of sellers in the market grows large. It is an equilibrium for all sellers to offer efficient mechanisms in the limit. Formally, two sellers, each with unit supply, compete by offering mechanisms to buyers with private valuations. Each buyer participates in the mechanism that offers him the largest interim expecte...|$|R
