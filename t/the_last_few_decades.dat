Over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>decade’s</b> pharmaceutical scientists throughout the world are trying to explore transdermal and transmucosal routes as an alternative to injections. Among the various transmucosal sites available, mucosa of the buccal cavity was found to be the most convenient and easily accessible site for the delivery of therapeutic agents for both local and systemic delivery as retentive dosage forms, because it has expanse of smooth muscle which is relatively immobile, abundant vascularization, rapid recovery time after exposure to stress and the near absence of langerhans cells. Direct access to the systemic circulation through the internal jugular vein bypasses drugs from the hepatic first pass metabolism leading to high bioavailability. This article reviews current status of various buccal bioadhesive dosage forms such as tablets, patches, hydrogels and films and describes the strategies to improve permeation of drugs through the Buccal mucosa...|$|R

40|$|Within the Central European EuLakes project (European Lakes Under Environmental Stressors, Supporting lake {{governance}} {{to mitigate}} the impact of climate change, Nr. 2 CE 243 P 3) lake’s sediments from Lake Garda have been investigated in order to reconstruct lake evolution at secular scale and to determine the lake reference conditions before stronger human impact. In fact the deepest basin (350 m) of the lake is less impacted by human activities and is suitable for reconstruction of long term environmental variability, including climate change {{and its effects on}} lake ecology. On the other side, the shallowest basin (81 m) is strongly affected by tourism and intensive agriculture, and thus is more suitable for studies on lake eutrophication. The main aim of this contribution is to evaluate the vulnerability of Lake Garda, the largest Italian lake, respect to specific human stressors (e. g. nutrients, hydroelectrical exploitation) in a climate change scenario and through a palaeolimnological approach. It focusses on changes in sub-fossil diatom assemblages in two short sediment cores collected from the deepest point of the two basins and on diatom-based reconstruction of lake trophic status. The core collected at 350 m presents two discontinuities. The deepest one dates in the mid 1940 s and shows a decrease in benthic taxa, which might be related with the intensive hydroelectrical exploitation of the catchment area. The second discontinuity is in early 1960 s and coincids with an increase in Fragilariaceae respect to centric taxa, the result of nutrient enrichment and climate change. The core from the shallower basin does not show discontinuities, though the diatom assemblages show a decrease in both mesotrophic Fragilariaceae and Cyclotella spp. since the middle 1960 s.
