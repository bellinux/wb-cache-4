5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>side</b> or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Edenian race in the fictional other {{dimension}} called Outworld, the character is over ten thousand years old, although she appears to be a young woman. Throughout the years, Kitana has risen to great importance, first as the loyal stepdaughter of Outworld's evil emperor Shao Kahn; then his enemy, tearing herself away from his grasp and freeing her home realm of Edenia; and then leading an army into Outworld to combat any chance of Kahn rising to power again. Kitana shared a subtle love interest with Earthrealm champion Liu Kang until his death, though they were briefly reunited prior to his resurrection. Despite her loyalty to Shao Kahn for most of her life, she has aligned herself on <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> after learning the truth about her past and her real family. A disfigured clone of Kitana, given the name Mileena, was introduced as Kitana's twin sister to become a prominent archrival in the original game series' timeline.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid {{is absent}} {{during the first}} part of the fifth novel. The {{character}} later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

500|$|In the off-season, the Islanders {{selected}} goaltender Rick DiPietro {{with the}} first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying, [...] "I didn't expect it at all. One day they're telling me I'm the goalie of the future, {{and the next day}} I'm gone. I didn't really appreciate that. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> is that [...] wanted me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} Hepburn played were, {{with very}} few exceptions, wealthy and intelligent, and often strong and independent. These tough characters tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden vulnerability. Garson Kanin described what he called [...] "the formula for a Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have worked time and time again." [...] Due to this repeated character arc, Britton sees Hepburn as embodying the [...] "contradictions" [...] of the [...] "nature and status of women", as the strong females she depicts are eventually [...] "restored to a safe position within the status quo". Film critic Molly Haskell has commented {{on the importance of}} this to Hepburn's career: with an intimidating presence, it was necessary that her characters [...] "do some kind of self-abasement, to stay on <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> of the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Darryl is {{initially}} unsuccessful in {{his attempts to}} win Charlie over, but Anderson hinted that her character would fall for him. She said, [...] "I think the way Steve [...] has played Brax, there is definitely enough there for Charlie {{to see that he}} has a heart and to see <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> in him as well." [...] Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, [...] "I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head." [...] Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's [...] "safe police world" [...] upside down, and Anderson told him, [...] "What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "fun and flirty" [...] and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as it has brought out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long.|$|E

500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to being}} vivified electricity, Cole {{is unable to}} use vehicles, take up weapons, or swim. Cole easily climbs {{buildings}} and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game; once acquired the player can use experience points, awarded for specific actions, stunts and missions, to increase the power's effectiveness. The growth of these powers is affected by Cole's current Karma level. Starting in a neutral position, it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>side,</b> [...] and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole's, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments, when the action pauses and the player is told, through a monologue by Cole, of two actions that can be taken, always a good and bad option. For example, one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face (Good), or force a civilian to do it for him (Evil). There are also a number of paired Good/Evil side missions in the game; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal. Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Doing so will lock out any purchased power(s) in the original chosen Karma sector. In addition to altering Cole's appearance and certain aspects of the game's story, Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City, they will come to help Cole in battle if his Karma is Good, but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma.|$|E

He resisted with all his might not to escape death, but merely to show that nothing was over until it was over."

2500|$|Raiden co-starred {{in his own}} three-issue miniseries Rayden & Kano. In this miniseries, it is stated that, {{while his}} fellow gods remain out of mortal affairs, Raiden never remains silent, and always tries to give <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> an {{advantage}} in the eternal struggle. Raiden saved Kano's life, and attempted {{to give him a}} sword called [...] "Ebbonrule," [...] which drew strength from an evil man who turned to the side of good. Raiden hoped Kano would slay Shao Kahn using the sword's power, but Kano gave the sword to Shao Kahn instead in exchange for godlike powers, which left Raiden to realize that his actions would never tip the balance of good and evil. During the last Tournament Edition issue, Raiden commandeered the group of heroes in Shao Kahn's tournament. He ultimately sacrificed himself to save the team from an ambush from Kano, Kintaro, Goro and Smoke. Raiden was depicted as having two female servants, named Wynd and Rayne.|$|E

The new site of East Maitland became the junction and the third East Maitland then became <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>siding.</b> For many years after 1916 there were five tracks from <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>siding</b> to just east of East Maitland station.

2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{written for}} the pair included the opposition of Colleen's family to the pairing, J.T.'s music career, and third party characters who came between them. In 2003, J.T. cheated on Colleen with Anita Hodges, an older woman considered a [...] "sexy cougar". Luckinbill explained J.T. as being [...] "weak in a desperate moment", and that he [...] "felt really sorry for someone he's known his whole life, and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> of J.T. emerged to offer Anita some comfort. Then it got really out of hand." [...] He added that J.T. [...] "cares deeply" [...] for Colleen and [...] "realizes she will be devastated by his actions". Luckinbill felt that J.T. [...] "wouldn't hurt her for the world, and yet {{that is exactly what}} he'll end up doing". In May 2004, Fonseca's contract was not renewed and she was confirmed to exit. Within the storyline, Colleen leaves Genoa City and J.T. because she does not want to {{stand in the way of}} his music career. However, she returned to reprise the role briefly that December. [...] J.T. had begun dating Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) and the writers wanted to bring Colleen back to [...] "add more complications to the story". Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again." [...] Luckinbill stated: [...] "When they were together, they were like some sort of supercouple and there is a huge amount of fans who still want them together." [...] News of Fonseca's second exit incited a fan outcry and a campaign pushing for the actress's permanent return. Fonseca made her final appearance as Colleen in February 2005.|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{the series}} finale, she does not become {{headmistress}} {{at the start of}} term as expected; Snape is appointed by the new Minister for Magic Thicknesse, who is actually under the Imperius Curse and acting for Voldemort. Death eater Alecto Carrow replaces McGonagall as deputy headmistress. Despite the many changes, she is retained as head of Gryffindor House. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, she goes to the Ravenclaw tower and finds Alecto stunned by Luna and Amycus Carrow searching for Harry. She's surprised when Amycus tells her Voldemort warned them Harry would try to break into the Ravenclaw Tower, proudly telling him Harry has no business on the Ravenclaw Tower, for Harry is in her House, Gryffindor. When Amycus suggests blaming the students to compensate for his sister's state, McGonagall immediately intervenes. In response, Amycus spits in her face. Harry, who is present and hidden under his invisibility cloak, reveals himself and uses the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus. [...] Harry then informs McGonagall that Voldemort is on his way and after tying up both the Carrows and placing them in a net, she sends three Patronuses – which manifest into a cat-to warn the other three Heads of House. When on her way to meet the Heads of House, she meets Snape, who questions her about Harry's whereabouts. Not realising that Snape is a re-doubled agent acting for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>side</b> and not knowing that he has important information for Harry, she attacks him, engaging in a fierce duel. With help from Professors Sprout and Flitwick, she succeeds in driving Snape away. McGonagall then takes charge of the school again and proceeds to secure it against Voldemort to ensure Harry can fulfil his mission from Dumbledore. She also organises the evacuation of the school's under-age students to ensure their safety. She then leads the remaining students, the staff of Hogwarts, and members of the Order of the Phoenix in the fight against Voldemort. She is seen during the battle with a large gash on her cheek and commanding a herd of charmed desks to charge at Death Eaters. When Harry has been apparently killed, she screams, causing Bellatrix Lestrange to laugh. Finally, McGonagall ends up duelling Voldemort alongside Kingsley Shacklebolt and Professor Slughorn. As is confirmed in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, McGonagall becomes Headmistress of Hogwarts after the Battle of Hogwarts and Snape's death; however, in an interview Rowling said McGonagall would be retired {{by the time of the}} Deathly Hallows epilogue (19 years after the main events of Deathly Hallows), as she is [...] "getting on in years".|$|E

50|$|In {{a review}} of sidings at {{unattended}} stations in 1953 it was noted of Clareville that inward goods comprised approximately 12 wagons of coal and 6 wagons of shooks for the Carrington Dairy Company, who consigned their outward goods at Carterton. Outward goods consisted primarily of hay and straw, amounting to approximately 12 wagons per year. It was considered that only minor inconvenience would be caused in closing Clareville to goods traffic and instead handling it at Carterton. In response to the review the District Engineer stated he had no objection to the lifting of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>siding</b> at Clareville. After the possibility of new business at Clareville from Airlift (N.Z.) was aborted on 11 June 1956, closure of <b>the</b> station to <b>goods</b> traffic was confirmed and a request to lift <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>siding</b> was put in hand on 20 November 1957 with work being completed by 1 March 1958.|$|R
