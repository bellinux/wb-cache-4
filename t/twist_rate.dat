40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{study was}} undertaken for investigating the heat transfer enhancement in a molten salt solar receiver tube with the twisted tapes. Various parameters of twisted tapes are studied in this paper. Comparisons of the Nusselt number and friction factor of twisted tape with previous correlation {{are made to}} evaluate the turbulence models used. Effects of the clearance ratios (C= 0 (tight fit), 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1) and twist ratios (γ= 2. 5, 5. 0, 12. 5, 15. 6, 25, 41. 7) on heat transfer rate (Nu), friction factor (f) are examined under non-uniform heat flux using molten salt as the testing fluid. Furthermore, the influence of grid generation on prediction results is also reported. Numerical calculations were performed with FLUENT 6. 3. 2 code, {{in the range of}} Reynolds number 7485 - 30553. The results show that the insert twisted tape can significantly improve the uniformity of temperature distribution of tube wall and molten salt. The decreases of clearance <b>rate</b> C and <b>twisted</b> <b>rate</b> γ can enhance the heat transfer effectively. Especially when clearance rate C= 0, that is the heat transfer enhancement effect with tight-fit twisted tape is the most significant. But at the same time, the decreases of clearance <b>rate</b> and <b>twisted</b> <b>rate</b> also lead to increase the friction factor. These methods and results can be extended to the heat transfer enhancement of all the solar concentrated receivers...|$|R
50|$|Presented Cd {{data can}} not be simply used for every gun-ammunition combination, since it was {{measured}} for the barrels, rotational (spin) velocities and ammunition lots the Lapua testers used during their test firings. Variables like differences in rifling (number of grooves, depth, width and other dimensional properties), <b>twist</b> <b>rates</b> and/or muzzle velocities impart different rotational (spin) velocities and rifling marks on projectiles. Changes in such variables and projectile production lot variations can yield different downrange interaction with the air the projectile passes through that can result in (minor) changes in flight behavior. This particular field of external ballistics is currently (2009) not elaborately studied nor well understood.|$|R
40|$|Metal {{nanowires}} are twisted to form yarns {{that are}} strong (0. 4 to 1. 1 GPa), pliable, and more conductive (3 × 106 S m- 1) than carbon nanotube yarns. Niobium nanowire fibers are extracted by etching a copper-niobium nano-composite material fabricated using the severe plastic deformation process. When impregnated with paraffin wax, the niobium (Nb) nanowire yarns produce fast rotational actuation as the wax is heated. The heated wax expands, untwisting the yarn, which then re-twists upon cooling. Normalized to yarn length, 12 deg mm- 1 of torsional rotation was achieved along with <b>twist</b> <b>rates</b> {{in excess of}} 1800 rpm.

25|$|For urban outdoor {{telephone}} cables containing {{hundreds or}} thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into small but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same <b>twist</b> <b>rate</b> within the cable can still experience some degree of crosstalk. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable.|$|E
25|$|The <b>twist</b> <b>rate</b> (also called {{pitch of}} the twist, usually defined in twists per meter) makes up part of the {{specification}} for a given type of cable. When nearby pairs have equal twist rates, the same conductors of the different pairs may repeatedly lie next to each other, partially undoing the benefits of differential mode. For this reason it is commonly specified that, at least for cables containing small numbers of pairs, the twist rates must differ.|$|E

To achieve this, the bullets {{have to be very}} long and normal cartridge overall lengths often have to be exceeded. Common rifling <b>twist</b> <b>rates</b> also often have to be tightened to stabilize very long projectiles. Such commercially nonexistent cartridges are termed [...] "wildcats". The use of a wildcat based (ultra) long-range cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and a fast-twist bore.|$|R
5000|$|Gain-twist rifling {{was used}} {{as early as the}} American Civil War (1861-65). Colt Army and Navy revolvers both {{employed}} gain-twist rifling. Gain-twist rifling, however, is more difficult to produce than uniform rifling, and therefore is more expensive. The military has used gain-twist rifling in a variety of weapons such as the [...] M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used in some current fighter jets and the larger [...] GAU-8 Avenger Gatling gun used in the A10 Thunderbolt II close air support jet. In these applications it allows lighter construction of the barrels by decreasing chamber pressures through the use of low initial <b>twist</b> <b>rates</b> but ensuring the projectiles have sufficient stability once they leave the barrel.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a scroll wave in an excitable medium with gradient excitability is studied in detail. Three parameter regimes {{can be distinguished}} by the degree of gradient. For a small gradient, the system reaches a simple rotating synchronization. In this regime, the rigid rotating velocity of spiral waves is maximal in the layers with the highest filament twist. As the excitability gradient increases, the scroll wave evolutes into a meandering synchronous state. This transition {{is accompanied by a}} variation in <b>twisting</b> <b>rate.</b> Filament <b>twisting</b> may prevent the breakup of spiral waves in the bottom layers with a low excitability with which a spiral breaks in a 2 D medium. When the gradient is large enough, the twisted filament breaks up, which results in a semi-turbulent state where the lower part is turbulent while the upper part contains a scroll wave with a low twisting filament...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} computational investigation {{was performed to}} {{examine the effect of}} rifling grooves on the aerodynamics of projectiles and determine whether the aerodynamics associated with the rifling grooves are a potential mechanism for in-flight trim angles. The experimental program consisted of spark-range firings of bullets from the standard twist barrel spanning the range of velocities typically encountered in flight. Additionally, sabot-launched smooth and pre-engraved bullets were fired from over-sized barrels with <b>twist</b> <b>rates</b> to match in-flight spin rates and velocities. The computational technique was first validated using existing wind tunnel data for a rifled projectile. Computational results were then obtained to complement the results from the spark-range testing. The results show that the aerodynamic components most sensitive to the rifling grooves are the Magnus force and moment and the roll-damping moment. These effects are relatively small for typical in-flight conditions and are unlikely to produce trim angle effects and can be ignored in future computational and experimental efforts...|$|R
