[...] One employment agency head who only hired legal household workers said, [...] "You have no idea, the frustration, sitting here, knocking your head against the wall, trying to do what's right. And then you have a Zoë Baird who exposes the fact <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is breaking the law." [...] The phrase [...] "to have a Zoë Baird problem" [...] became rooted in the vocabulary of the American professional and political classes.|$|E
500|$|Remembered {{well for}} his turns of phrase and his puns, Wanderone once wrote, [...] "If you {{happened}} to drive from Mobile to Dowell [...] with a carload of pool hustlers, {{you would get}} bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well", a reference {{not only to the}} area's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers. Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg." [...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E
2500|$|Winship {{proceeded}} {{to declare war}} against the Nationalists, in response to which Jaime Benítez Rexach, {{a student at the}} University of Chicago at the time, wrote a letter to President Roosevelt which in part read as follows: [...] "The point I am to make is that the Governor (Winship) himself through his military approach to things has helped keep Puerto Rico in an unnecessary state of turmoil. He seems to think that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> should keep out. As a matter of fact he has played the Nationalist game and they have played his.|$|E

5000|$|Regine tells Seth her {{theory that}} {{this place is}} the real world, but people liked being [...] "online" [...] (the Lethe, as they called it) {{so much that they}} decided to stay online permanently. The coffins were {{designed}} to carry out bodily functions. The reason they woke up in the real world is because all of them died when they hit a particular spot on their head, which disconnected them. Seth further adds to her theory <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> coffins are in the prison near his house, and he is determined to go there. Regine and Tomasz are opposed out of fear of the Driver, but Seth goes on his own.|$|R
50|$|This film is more sober in its description. The film {{makes it}} clear that the Japanese Americans were forced from their circumstances, and that they were made to live in a rather barren {{relocation}} camp, which was surrounded by armed guards. The film states bluntly that the medicine available at the camp was the same as <b>that</b> of <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> in war time—barely adequate.|$|R

2500|$|These {{discussions were}} {{reported}} to the House of Commons by Thorneycroft, leading to a storm of protest. Air Commodore Sir Arthur Vere Harvey pointed out that while Skybolt had suffered five test failures, Polaris had thirteen failures in its development. He went on to state [...] "that some of us on this side, {{who want to see}} Britain retain a nuclear deterrent, are highly suspicious of some of the American motives... and say that the British people are tired of being pushed around". Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond asked: [...] "Does not this mark the absolute failure of the policy of the independent deterrent? Is it not the case <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> in the world knew this, except the Conservative Party in this country? Is it not the case that the Americans gave up production of the B52, which was to carry Skybolt, nine months ago?" ...|$|E

Scully realizes that she is being {{protected}} from the contagion {{by a combination of}} the alien genomes that remained after she was abducted and experimented on, and the DNA anomalies instilled within her at the request of Reyes. It is the absence of alien DNA <b>that</b> makes <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> susceptible. Mulder, meanwhile, approaches Cigarette Smoking Man, who offers him a chance to survive the outbreak. Mulder declines, and is found by Miller, who returns him to Washington with the hope of finding a cure.|$|R

What I've said in the past is, the danger is that judgments are effectively writing a new law which is what parliament is meant to do." [...] He added that the law should be reviewed to [...] "catch up with how people consume media today".|$|R

5000|$|No Need to Argue is {{the second}} studio album by the Irish rock band The Cranberries, {{released}} on 3 October 1994. It is the band's best selling album, and has sold about 17 million copies worldwide. It contains the band's most successful single to date, [...] "Zombie". The album's mood is darker and harsher than <b>that</b> on <b>Everybody</b> <b>Else</b> Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, released a year before. It shows a more mature performance by lead singer Dolores O'Riordan, writing about war, death, love and disappointment. Her voice is clearer, without the previous album's double and triple voice layering.|$|R
5000|$|Geno Auriemma on Ann Strother: [...] "is one {{of those}} impact players that makes them when you need them. I can't think of anybody we'd rather have {{shooting}} the ball. When we get Ann off and running like <b>that,</b> it gives <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> so much confidence. All of a sudden a three-point game becomes an 11-point game and everybody takes a sigh of relief. It makes everyone around her a better player.

60|$|The {{news that}} Little Joe Otter told at the Smiling Pool,--how Farmer Brown's boy {{had run away}} from Buster Bear without even seeing him,--soon spread all over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, until every one who lives there knew about it. Of course, Peter Rabbit helped spread it. Trust Peter for <b>that!</b> But <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> helped too. You see, {{they had all been}} afraid of Farmer Brown's boy for so long that they were tickled almost to pieces at the very thought of having some one in the Green Forest who could make Farmer Brown's boy feel fear as they had felt it. And so it was that Buster Bear became a hero right away to most of them.|$|R

5000|$|I {{think the}} fear when writing a song always that {{the outside world}} won’t think it’s as awesome as you do. That’s the scary part about {{progressing}} through releasing the song, and also the fun part in sharing it with other people. Sharing that experience {{with all of these}} people, it goes from being something that’s very much for me and for the other writers who wrote with me, into being something <b>that’s</b> for <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> <b>That’s</b> what performing is. You’re giving it to everyone else. I think that that’s really cool, it’s also super trippy, because you’d never think this thing that you created in a small room with four other people would be something you’d get to share with so many people". — Mendler about the writing process.|$|R

It grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel, backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it, but we kept warm, and woke in time {{in the morning to}} find <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> had left for Gemmi three hours before--so our little plan of helping that German family (principally the old man) over the pass, was a blocked generosity.|$|E
50|$|Nathan and Tracy {{go to the}} Company {{facility}} where Angela is keeping Peter sedated. She explains that Zimmerman helped the Company develop a synthetic ability drug and that Tracy, her sisters Niki Sanders and Barbara, and Nathan were among his test subjects. Angela explains that since his father was disappointed that Nathan didn't have the genetic code for special powers, he authorized experimentation on Nathan. The decision {{was based on the}} assumption <b>that</b> since <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> in the Petrelli family had powers, Nathan's body should be able to take it. Angela apologizes for the experiments on Tracy and says they tried to make amends by splitting the formula in half so no one could recreate it. However, Nathan reproaches her apology and leaves with Tracy. Nathan suggests that he and Tracy go to Mohinder for help. At his lab, Mohinder encases Maya in a cocoon when she discovers his disturbing secret.|$|R
60|$|As the day {{continued}} calm, Mark {{was in no}} hurry, but passed half an hour in sounding {{the little}} bay that was formed by the sunken rocks that lay off the eastern, or weather end of the Crater Reef, as, {{in a spirit of}} humility, he insisted on calling <b>that</b> which <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> now calls Mark's Reef. Here he not only found abundance of water for all he wanted, but to his surprise he also found a sandy bottom, formed no doubt by the particles washed from the surrounding rocks under the never-ceasing abrasion of the waves. On the submerged reef {{there were only a few}} inches of water, and our mariners saw clearly that it was possible to secure the ship in this basin, in a very effectual manner, could they only have a sufficiency of good weather in which to do it.|$|R
60|$|Not {{the least}} curious feature in this {{assemblage}} was, <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> present {{was so much}} surprised and embarrassed {{by the sight of}} <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> <b>that</b> nobody ventured to speak. Mr Chuzzlewit alone broke silence.|$|R

I don't notice much when a fellow sets out to do right <b>that</b> folks think <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is on the square. No, sir, they don't seem to consider that kind of complaint so catching. Now, you take another thing: A woman goes round with the scarlet fever in her clothes, and a whole carful of people take it home to their children; but let a nice young girl get in, fresh as an apple, and a perfect daisy for wholesomeness every way, and she don't give it to a single soul on board.

[...] He wrote an editorial against same-sex marriage the following year, arguing that marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples because of its traditional role in the procreation and nurturing of children. He wrote that [...] "homosexuals already {{have the right to}} marry, providing <b>that</b> -- like <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> -- they marry someone of the opposite sex". [...] He opposed granting spousal benefits for same-sex couples, describing supporters of the initiative as [...] "activist liberal judges and a small but aggressive homosexual lobby".|$|R
