500|$|Cultura Profética {{originally}} {{began as}} a cover band, performing popular reggae songs in small bars and clubs before beginning to perform original music in Spanish. Shortly after transitioning to perform original music, the group adopted the name Cultura Profética, which {{was inspired by the}} view that [...] "music is a voice of culture and is prophetic because the reggae music <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love,</b> and that influenced us, is from the '70s with themes of what's happening now that can affect our future", according to guitarist/bassist Omar Silva.|$|E
500|$|While Jack was {{the lead}} vocalist, Meg did sing lead vocals on four of the band's songs: [...] "In the Cold, Cold Night" [...] (from Elephant), [...] "Passive Manipulation" [...] (from Get Behind Me Satan), [...] "Who's a Big Baby?" [...] (released on the [...] "Blue Orchid" [...] single), and [...] "St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air)" [...] (from Icky Thump). She also {{accompanied}} Jack on the songs [...] "Your Southern Can Is Mine" [...] from their album De Stijl, [...] "Hotel Yorba" [...] and [...] "This Protector" [...] from their album White Blood Cells, on [...] "You Don't Know What Love Is [...] "(You Just Do as You're Told)" [...] and [...] "Rag & Bone" [...] from their album Icky Thump, [...] "Rated X" [...] and also sang alongside Jack and Holly Golightly on the song [...] "It's True <b>That</b> <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> One Another", from the album Elephant.|$|E
500|$|Glenn Erickson {{discussed}} Danger: Diabolik {{twice on}} DVD Talk (in 1998 and 2005); describing {{the film as}} a guilty pleasure, he praised Bava's stylized visuals, noting his use of bright colours, elaborate sets and wide lenses, [...] "giving almost every shot a distorted depth that lends the film a consistent comic book dynamism". While noting the minimal characterization of Diabolik himself (describing him as [...] "the final distillation of the idea <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> criminals because we secretly admire the transgressions they represent"), he felt that Marisa Mell's portrayal of Eva presented her as loving Diabolik [...] "on a romantic plane of surprising believability. [...] adoring faithfulness is so physical and pure that the sincerity of their farewell ("You'll not be alone while I live!") is tenderly affecting." [...] Erickson also admired Terry-Thomas' campy portrayal of the Minister of Interior, describing his news conference as [...] "easily outdo TV's Batman." [...] Thematically, he has noted that Diabolik's desire to steal for himself and Eva [...] "represent the ultimate end of materialist consumerism", as well as [...] "the rollercoaster Italian politics of the time, which seemed to flip-flop from conservative to socialist and back again on a weekly basis;" [...] Erickson also mentions that [...] "Diabolik's world stresses strangely fetishistic surfaces and textures, backing up film theorist Raymond Durgnat's assertion that the psychic land of pulp fantasy is fundamentally a sexual one." ...|$|E

500|$|Kiedis was lyrically {{influenced}} by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs {{written for the}} album such as [...] "By the Way," [...] "I Could Die for You," [...] "Dosed," [...] "Warm Tape" [...] and non-album tracks [...] "Someone" [...] and [...] "Body of Water" [...] all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and [...] "Don't Forget Me" [...] expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: [...] "On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean." [...] "Venice Queen" [...] was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: [...] "We all want to tell her/Tell her <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, to {{celebrate}} Neighbours 25th anniversary, British satellite broadcasting company, Sky UK, profiled twenty-five characters {{of which they}} believed were the most memorable in the series history. Paul is in the list and joke about his many wives stating: [...] "How many of Paul's five wives can you name? No points for current wife Rebecca, ten for naming Lynn, Gail, or Christina Alessi, and 1,400 points for remembering first wife, plumber Terry [...] Yes, Paul's been around the block." [...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> to hate him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties. Although it's probably {{safe to say that}} period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989." [...] He has also been branded as a [...] "legend character". Entertainment reporting website Last Broadcast praised Paul's development, stating: [...] "As the kind of shady character who'd do anything to make a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street {{to make way for a}} new supermarket development. And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Stephen Holden from The New York Times, Madonna explained {{the significance of the}} performance: [...] "Finally, right when you think I'll end [...] on a happy note, I come out with my family to do a Bob Fosse-meets-'Clockwork Orange' rendition of 'Keep It Together'. It's the show's ultimate statement about the family, because we're absolutely brutalizing with each other, while there's also no mistaking <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> each other deeply." [...] Author Lynne Layton complimented the performance, saying that [...] "as in her double attitude to materialism, femininity, and everything else, what marks the performance is not that Madonna is in control, but that she is open about {{the pros and cons of}} family life and obviously echoes the experience of many." [...] Her thoughts were shared by John LeLand from Newsday, who complimented the aerobics performed onstage by Madonna and her dancers. Conversely, author Allen Metz commented that although the performance was tightly choreographed, the overall feel was marred due to the song's own [...] "shortcomings". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune felt that the addition of lines from [...] "Family Affair" [...] underlined the [...] "home-is-where-the-heart-is" [...] theme of [...] "Keep It Together". Louis Virtel from The Backlot praised the performance of the song, stating that it served as the [...] "perfect concluding performance." [...] Two different performances were recorded and released on video: the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, filmed in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, filmed in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. It was also shown on the HBO special titled Madonna Live! – Blond Ambition World Tour, and was added in her 1991 documentary, [...]|$|E

2500|$|Richard Fass puts {{forward the}} {{possibility}} that business scandals {{in the real world}} make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society. [...] Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: [...] "It is not <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> honesty less, but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> success more." [...] Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any. However, {{it has been shown that}} the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{painting}}'s admirers {{were the}} art critic Jean Cassou {{and the poet}} José Bergamín, both of whom praised the painting as quintessentially Spanish.

In the {{introduction}} to the 2004 edition of Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel, the historian Mezvinsky said, [...] "We realize that, by criticizing Jewish fundamentalism, we are criticizing a part of the past <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love.</b> We wish that members of every human grouping would criticize their own past, even before criticizing others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and is it possible for love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E
2500|$|Project 86 has {{sometimes}} been labeled a [...] "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art {{to be the best}} conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. [...] "We're not going {{to go in there and}} say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs." [...] "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...," [...] the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, [...] "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience." [...] In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined [...] "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>love,</b> and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there." ...|$|E
