5|$|Skelton went on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own radio show, The Raleigh Cigarette Program, on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for {{the show}} was Ozzie Nelson; his wife, Harriet, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Brady {{completed}} 7 of 8 passes for 54yards on an 82-yard drive. On the last play, he took a snap in shotgun formation with Kevin Faulk to his right, Brady jumped in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> arms raised {{to make it look}} like a play used by the Patriots before where Faulk took the direct snap. The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving Wes Welker open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21–14 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver Dennis Northcutt dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a Josh Scobee 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–17. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's Derek Landri was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28–17 lead.|$|E

25|$|Ricky Ponting {{chose to}} bat {{when he won}} the toss for the visiting Australian cricket team in an {{extremely}} tense and see-sawing match at The County Ground, Bristol. It looked like a great decision when Jon Lewis and Darren Gough were smashed about early on, as Australia made their way to 57 for 0 after 11 overs with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden taking sixes off Lewis over midwicket. However, with the entrance of Steve Harmison, everything changed. In his third over – the 12th of the game, he removed Gilchrist with a bouncy ball that the batsman edged behind, then Ponting with a yorker that he didn't play at – resulting in lbw – then a dot ball, and then Martyn with a slog shot to Pietersen at third man. Australia tried to consolidate, but when Hayden tried to hit out off Harmison four overs later, Paul Collingwood jumped up to pick the ball out of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> right hand – a magnificent catch, and Australia had lost four wickets for six runs, reminiscent of their collapse in the Twenty20 match earlier on in the week.|$|E

500|$|Following nomination, Nixon {{held his}} hands in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{trademark}} [...] "V" [...] sign of victory, delivering an acceptance speech written over the preceding weeks. In his speech, he remarked: [...] "Tonight I do not promise the millennium in the morning. I don't promise that we can eradicate poverty and end discrimination {{in the space of}} four or even eight years. But I do promise action. And a new policy for peace abroad, a new policy for peace and progress and justice at home." [...] - Fmr. Vice President Richard Nixon, 1968 Republican Nominee for President ' He called for a new era of negotiation with communist nations, and a strengthening {{of the criminal justice system}} to restore law and order. [...] Marking himself as a champion of the American Dream, he stressed greater unity, invoking the silent majority. Nixon also discussed economics, articulating his opposition to social welfare, advocating programs designed to help African Americans start their own small businesses. By the end of his address, he promised that [...] "the long dark night for America is about to end." ...|$|E
5000|$|Marwan is a {{physically}} strong, and aggressive striker with good technique, tactical intelligence, and very confident in going at opponents, {{and ability to}} score impressive goals, in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and <b>with</b> <b>his</b> both feet from anywhere on the pitch, {{has been described as}} a [...] "modern striker".|$|R

500|$|According to Gay, {{characters}} with [...] "extreme personality quirks" [...] were both fun and stressful to write: for the clown Moe, {{he found it}} challenging to get the balance right between his silly jokes and the seriousness of his dialogue. Among other challenging characters to write for were Acro, who led to [...] "heated arguments" [...] {{about how to get}} his personality and tone right; and Morgan Fey, whose [...] "very old style" [...] of speaking in the Japanese version was difficult to translate to English. One aspect they had to change due to cultural differences was a conversation with the lecherous character Director Hotti, where an animation of him grabbing in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hands is played while he talks about Pearl. According to Hsu, the Japanese version is considered funny to Japanese people, as Hotti is set up as the [...] "butt of the joke", and Phoenix reacts negatively to him, while it would have been considered sickening to an American audience. They were unable to change the animation, so the dialogue was rewritten to instead be directed at an adult nurse.|$|E
500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese {{started to}} break. The {{struggle}} around the Portuguese royal standard was ferocious: having the flag carrier's (the ensign [...] ) hand cut off, he transferred the standard {{to the remaining}} hand which was also cut off. So he sustained the standard on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> teeth until he fainted under the wounds inflicted by the enemies which surrounded and captured him.|$|E
50|$|A dynamic, left-footed striker, Boriello is {{primarily}} {{known for his}} eye for goal, as well as ability in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> both <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head and acrobatically.

60|$|They were {{detained}} there till {{the sun had}} long set, though <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> saturated <b>with</b> <b>his</b> redness, was full of soft twilight, while the moon, scarcely past the full, was just high enough to silver the quiet sea, and throw {{the shadow of the}} battlements and towers on the sward whitened with dew.|$|R

Bill Brannigan (Pat O'Brien) invites {{friend and}} hotshot pilot Tommy O'Toole (James Cagney), the self-styled [...] "world's {{greatest}} aviator", {{to join the}} USMC Reserve Aviator training program. O'Toole arrives and promptly starts to move in on Brannigan's love interest, Betty Roberts (Margaret Lindsay), and in typical cocky [...] fashion, antagonizes nearly everyone else. Although not temperamentally suited for the military, O'Toole completes primary training and after surviving an accident, eventually realizes that {{he is willing to}} change. After a competition in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friend Brannigan, and for the attentions of Betty, there is a predictable conclusion with O'Toole coming out the victor.|$|E
2500|$|The TV series began {{production}} in 1949, and was filmed by ZIV Productions at the Ray Corrigan Ranch in Simi Valley in Ventura County, California. Renaldo, {{a native of}} Romania, and Carrillo, a native of Los Angeles, were the first regular Hispanic television stars. (Desi Arnaz, Sr, of Cuban descent, went on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife and co-star, Lucille Ball, in I Love Lucy a year later.) When the series began, Carrillo was already 70 years of age; Renaldo, 46. Part of the humor of the series is reflected in Carrillo's mangling of the English language. Pancho's catch-phrase, when amused by Renaldo, was a drawn-out [...] "Ohhh, Ceesco!" [...] Viewers also became acquainted with the characters' horses, Cisco's Diablo and Pancho's Loco.|$|E
2500|$|The priest will bless {{with his}} right hand, and the bishop will bless with both hands. In both cases, the hand is held so that the fingers form the {{initials}} IC XC (the abbreviation for [...] "Jesus Christ" [...] in Greek), and at the concluding words he traces the Sign of the Cross in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand. If a bishop is holding his paterissa (crozier) while making the dismissal, he will raise both his right and left hands and trace the Sign of the Cross with both his crozier and right hand, crossing the one {{in front of the}} other, then blessing again with the Dikirion and Trikion, as the choir chants, Eis pollá etē, Déspota ("Many years, O Master"). More solemn benedictions, such as that which comes {{at the end of the}} Divine Liturgy, will be made with a blessing cross rather than the hand.|$|E
