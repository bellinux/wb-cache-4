5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E
5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, these cofactors are {{continuously}} recycled {{as part of}} metabolism. As an example, the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> of ATP in {{the human}} body is about 0.1mole. This ATP is constantly being broken down into ADP, and then converted back into ATP. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75kg. In typical situations, humans use up their body weight of ATP {{over the course of the}} day. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 1000 to 1500 times daily.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{determined}} by radioimmunoassay and double immunoelectrophoresis the <b>total</b> <b>quantities</b> and distributions of A apoproteins in three adult patients affected with Tangier disease (hereditary alpha-lipoprotein deficiency). Compared with normal plasma, the <b>total</b> <b>quantities</b> of apoproteins A-I and A-II in Tangier plasma were determined {{to be less than}} 1 % and 5 - 7 %, respectively. In Tangier patients, approximately 90 % of the apoprotein A-I sedimented when ultracentrifugations of plasma were carried out at density 1. 21 g/ml KBr. By contrast, more than 95 % of the apoprotein A-II floated under those conditions. In normal plasma, approximately 90 % of both apoproteins A-I and A-II is found in the 1. 063 - 1. 21 -g/ml KBr density fraction. These findings suggest that complete dissociation of A apoproteins occurs in Tangier plasma. This dissociation of apoproteins was confirmed by double immunoelectrophoresis with monospecific antisera. Immunochemical and electrophoretic experiments did not provide evidence for a structural abnormality of apoprotein A-I in these patients, The results taken together strongly suggest that normal high-density lipoproteins are absent from Tangier plasma...|$|R
500|$|Cournot, a {{professor}} of mathematics, developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for duopoly—a market condition defined by competition between two sellers. [...] This treatment of competition, first published in Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, {{is referred to as}} Cournot duopoly. It is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost. [...] Further, it assumed that both goods were homogeneous. [...] Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> supplied. [...] The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit Market price. [...] Differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits. Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the marginalists. [...] Cournot's models of duopoly and Oligopoly also represent one of the first formulations of non-cooperative games. [...] Today the solution can be given as a Nash equilibrium but Cournot's work preceded modern game theory by over 100 years.|$|E
