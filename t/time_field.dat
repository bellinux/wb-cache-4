2500|$|The Language and Cognition Department, {{headed by}} Stephen C. Levinson, investigates the {{relationship}} between language, culture and general cognition, making use of the [...] "natural laboratory" [...] of language variation. In this way, the department brings the perspective of language diversity to bear {{on a range of}} central problems in the language sciences. It maintains over a dozen field sites around the world, where languages are described (often for the first <b>time),</b> <b>field</b> experiments conducted and extended corpora of natural language usage collected. In addition, the department is characterized by a diversity of methods, ranging from linguistic analysis and ethnography to developmental perspectives, from psycholinguistic experimentation to conversation analysis, from corpus statistics to brain imaging, and from phylogenetics to linguistic data mining.|$|E
2500|$|Lingo simply wasn't {{satisfied}} with the average strain of Airedale, and after an incredible series of breedings, for which he brought in great Airedales {{from all over the}} world, he created the [...] "King Oorang." [...] At the <b>time,</b> <b>Field</b> and Stream magazine called it, [...] "the greatest utility dog {{in the history of the}} world." [...] The Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo's death in 1969. To help promote the King Oorang, as well as his kennels, Lingo created the Oorang Indians football team headed up by Jim Thorpe. The team played in National Football League from 1922–1923. Jerry Siebert, an Airedale breeder in Buckeye Lake, Ohio, followed in Lingo's footsteps, and bred [...] "Jerang Airedales." [...] There is a kennel in Tennessee that claims to have original Oorang Airedales.|$|E

5000|$|A {{model of}} quantised time was {{proposed}} by Vaknin in his 1982 Ph.D. dissertation, titled [...] "Time Asymmetry Revisited". The dissertation {{was published by}} California Miramar University. He postulates {{the existence of a}} particle (chronon). In the proposed theory, time {{is the result of the}} interaction of chronons, very much as other forces in nature are the result of other particle interactions. Vaknin postulates the existence of various time quarks (up, down, colors, etc.) whose properties cancel each other and thus the arrow of time is derived (time asymmetry). The postulated particle (chronon) is not only an ideal clock, but also mediates time itself (analogous to the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass). In other words, what we call [...] "time" [...] is the interaction between chronons in a field. Chronons exchange between them a particle and thereby exert a force. [...] "Events" [...] are perturbations in the <b>Time</b> <b>Field</b> and they are distinct from chronon interactions. Chronon interactions (particle exchanges) in the <b>Time</b> <b>Field</b> generate [...] "time" [...] and [...] "time asymmetry" [...] as we observe them.|$|E
