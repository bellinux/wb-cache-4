5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in feeding groups. Other calls that can be heard when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest sounds like chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E

50|$|The fabulous {{qualities of}} <b>the</b> oozlum <b>bird</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of a}} poem by W. T. Goodge (1862-1909). In the poem <b>The</b> Oozlum <b>Bird,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to fly {{backwards}} and has the singular ability {{of being able to}} fly up in the air while letting the earth turn under it. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to be large enough to bear the weight of a man.|$|R
5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when the air is cool. Later in the day, when the air temperature may reach over 50°C, <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> safe.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{landlocked}} lowland {{counties and}} most of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> typical of English farmland habitat. Many coastal, oceanic and highland birds are absent or rare, and there are few rare vagrants compared to coastal areas. The construction of two large reservoirs, Eyebrook Reservoir in 1940 and Rutland Water (England's largest reservoir) in 1976, has provided freshwater environments enabling many aquatic birds to thrive.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>was</b> MacLeod’s {{first major}} public art commission, and is {{situated}} in Vancouver British Columbia. Partially inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's film <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> (1963), <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>is</b> a large sculpture of two house sparrows, <b>birds</b> that <b>are</b> not indigenous to British Columbia. This sculpture challenges the idea of place and impossibility.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bird</b> lays eggs {{moderately}} well, {{compared to}} other birds of similar proportions. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> also primarily reared for meat. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> used for cockfighting {{but this is no}} longer practised in Britain. However, many other countries continue with cockfighting, and Old Oxford English Game is commonly used.|$|R

5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of}} a courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the smaller}} insectivorous birds {{including}} the warblers, hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances, usually at night. They land {{in the morning and}} may feed for a few days before resuming their migration. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> referred to as passage migrants in the regions where they occur for short durations between the origin and destination.|$|E
5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E

5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
40|$|There are no recent {{confirmed}} {{sightings of}} this species within the European region. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> formerly bred on the Iberian peninsula, and it was last recorded in 1981. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> therefore classified as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) within the Europe and the EU 27 regions, although <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> considered Least Concern globally (BirdLife International 2012) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{also named}} Yellow-spotted Bush-sparrow (Gymnoris pyrgita).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> 20-25 cm in length, and {{is mostly}} light green in color. It has a {{trailing}} yellow edge on its folded wings {{and is also}} seen when <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> in flight. It {{is closely related to}} the white-winged parakeet. In fact, it was considered conspecific until 1997.|$|R
5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the north or when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or swooping dives. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E
50|$|Araang {{originally}} is {{the name}} of a bird. Local indigenous parlance (Tangkhul Naga tribe) refers to as <b>the</b> Hornbill <b>bird.</b> In <b>the</b> nomadic wandering age, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> widely considered by the natives as a trusted guide throughout their various migratory routes. <b>The</b> Araang <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> today, a highly endangered species with rare sightings only in the thick forested Angoching range. Richly adorned in beautiful multi-colour and majestic features, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> a true manifestation of the Creator. It signifies pride and honour.|$|R

5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations {{have been affected by}} mercury contamination.|$|E
5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on {{seeds in the}} winter and insects in the spring and summer. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E

50|$|The winter {{would come}} {{instantly}} {{with a heavy}} snow storm. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> now homeless in the cold without preparation.

50|$|Measurements are: wing, 19.9 cm; bill, 3.7 cm; tarsus 3.6 cm. This means <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{size of a}} Cape teal or garganey, with a {{total length}} of 40-45 cm.
