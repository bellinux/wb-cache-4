5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{the most}} {{impressive}} aesthetic works were done among the scholars and urban elite. Calligraphy and painting remained a central interest to both court painters and scholar-gentry who considered the Four Arts part of their cultural identity and social standing. The painting of {{the early years of}} the dynasty included such painters as the orthodox Four Wangs and the individualists Bada Shanren (1626–1705) and Shitao (1641–1707). The nineteenth century saw such innovations as the Shanghai School and the Lingnan School which used the technical skills of tradition <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for modern painting.|$|E

500|$|By early 1918, {{many cities}} in western Russia faced famine {{as a result}} of chronic food shortages. Lenin blamed this on the kulaks, or wealthier peasants, who {{allegedly}} hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial value. In May 1918, he issued a requisitioning order that established armed detachments to confiscate grain from kulaks for distribution in the cities, and in June called for the formation of Committees of Poor Peasants to aid in requisitioning. This policy resulted in vast social disorder and violence, as armed detachments often clashed with peasant groups, helping <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for the civil war. A prominent example of Lenin's views was his August 1918 telegram to the Bolsheviks of Penza, which called upon them to suppress a peasant insurrection by publicly hanging at least 100 [...] "known kulaks, rich men, [...] bloodsuckers".|$|E

500|$|Super Metroid was {{developed}} by Nintendo R {{with a staff of}} 15 people managed by Gunpei Yokoi. The game was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano. Intelligent Systems, who co-developed the original Metroid with R, handled the programming for Super Metroid. The opening dialogue was voiced by Dan Owsen, an employee of Nintendo of America. The game, which was released almost a decade after the original Metroid game, took half a year to gain approval for the initial idea, and actual development of the game took two more years to complete. When asked why the game took so long to make, Sakamoto responded, [...] "We wanted to wait until a true action game was needed. [...] And also <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for the reappearance of Samus Aran." [...] Previously visited areas were added to Super Metroid to add a sense of familiarity that would satisfy players of previous Metroid games.|$|E
500|$|Because Ben Browder and Claudia Black {{were well}} known for {{formerly}} starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series Farscape, the Stargate producers refrained from emphasizing the pairing of Mitchell and Vala beyond in-jokes. The producers instead opted to further the comedic chemistry between Claudia Black and Michael Shanks, who linked their characters' early relationship to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism". Mirroring Vala's sexiness in season 8, [...] "The Powers That Be" [...] writer Martin Gero chose Qetesh, the Egyptian Goddess of Love and Beauty, as a fitting former Goa'uld identity for Vala. Nevertheless, Black and the producers refrained from portraying the character as too sexually manipulative. A scene from [...] "The Ties That Bind", which was later cut for time, originally made clear that Wallace Shawn's character greatly exaggerated the sexual relationship between him and Vala. Claudia Black was brought back into the show {{for the last two}} episodes of season 9, at which time the actress was seven months pregnant. Producer Robert C.

40|$|More than {{a decade}} has elapsed since {{the link between the}} endosomal sorting complex {{required}} for transport (ESCRT) machinery and HIV- 1 protein trafficking and budding was first identified. L domains in HIV- 1 Gag mediate recruitment of ESCRT which function in bud abscission releasing the viral particle from the host cell. Beyond virus budding, the ESCRT machinery is also involved in the endocytic pathway, cytokinesis, and autophagy. In the past few years, the number of non-ESCRT host proteins shown to be required in the assembly process has also grown. In this paper, we highlight the role of recently identified cellular factors that link ESCRT machinery to calcium signaling machinery and we suggest that this liaison contributes <b>to</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for productive ESCRT recruitment and mediation of abscission. Parallel paradigms for non-ESCRT roles in virus budding and cytokinesis will be discussed...|$|R

All models have additional pNGBs in their spectrum that should be accessible at LHC. We analyze the patterns of symmetry breaking and present all relevant couplings of the pNGBs with the gauge fields.

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, {{many of the}} Great Leap's {{economic}} policies were reversed by initiatives spearheaded by Liu, Deng, and Zhou Enlai. This moderate group of pragmatists were unenthusiastic about Mao's utopian visions. Owing to his loss of esteem within the party, Mao developed a decadent and eccentric lifestyle. [...] By 1962, while Zhou, Liu and Deng managed affairs of state and the economy, Mao had effectively withdrawn from economic decision-making, and focused {{much of his time}} on further contemplating his contributions to Marxist–Leninist social theory, including the idea of [...] "continuous revolution".

2500|$|The second {{rule of the}} {{avoidance}} doctrine mirrors the ripeness requirement in that it obliges federal courts to refrain from deciding a dispute prematurely. The primary rationale for the ripeness doctrine, another justiciability doctrine arising from the case or controversy requirement, is [...] "to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements." [...] In a leading case on ripeness, Poe v. Ullman, the Court relied on {{the avoidance}} doctrine <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for its decision that the controversy was not ripe.
