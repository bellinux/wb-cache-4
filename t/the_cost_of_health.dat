25|$|Just {{less than}} 9% of the {{population}} purchases individual health care insurance. Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums.

Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries.

25|$|Two {{distinct}} premium {{support systems}} {{have recently been}} proposed in Congress to control the cost of Medicare. The House Republicans’ 2012 budget would have abolished traditional Medicare and required the eligible population to purchase private insurance with a newly created premium support program. This plan would have cut the cost of Medicare by capping {{the value of the}} voucher and tying its growth to inflation, which is expected to be lower than rising health costs, saving roughly $155 billion over 10 years. Paul Ryan, the plan’s author, claimed that competition would drive down costs, but the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the plan would dramatically raise <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> care, with all of the additional costs falling on enrollees. The CBO found that under the plan, typical 65-year-olds would go from paying 35 percent of their health care costs to paying 68 percent by 2030.|$|E

2500|$|The Healthy Americans Act (HAA), {{also known}} as the Wyden-Bennett Act, is a Senate bill that had {{proposed}} to improve health care in the United States, with changes that included the establishment of universal health care. It would transition away from employer-provided health insurance, to employer-subsidized insurance, having instead individuals choose their health care plan from state-approved private insurers. It sought to make <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> insurance more transparent to consumers, with the expectation being that this would increase market pressures to drive health insurance costs down. The proposal created a system that would be paid for by both public and private contributions. It would establish Healthy Americans Private Insurance Plans (HAPIs) and require those who do not already have health insurance coverage, and who do not oppose health insurance on religious grounds, to enroll themselves and their children in a HAPI. According to its sponsors, it would guarantee universal, affordable, comprehensive, portable, high-quality, private health coverage that is as good or better than Members of Congress have today; [...] A 2008 preliminary analysis by the Congressional Budget Office concluded it would be [...] "essentially" [...] self-financing in the first year that it was fully implemented.|$|E
