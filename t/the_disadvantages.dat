5|$|DST {{inherits}} and can magnify <b>the</b> <b>disadvantages</b> {{of standard}} time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for {{it along with}} time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of {{the turbine}} were {{eventually}} overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|Though {{considered}} to be quick-firing, the propellant for 7-inch guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary 6-inch guns. The Navy considered these to be excellent for the intended role; however, in World War I North Atlantic convoy duty, <b>the</b> <b>disadvantages</b> in seakeeping outweighed the utility; they were removed from battleships remaining in US service in 1918.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{can also}} be answered by no longer doing {{a part of the}} plan that causes the aff to link into <b>the</b> <b>disadvantage.</b> This {{is often referred to as}} a severance perm, because by making this claim the affirmative does all parts of the plan except the part that links to <b>the</b> <b>disadvantage,</b> thus severing out of part of their own plan. This argument is also rarely made, due to the theory arguments it brings up on the affirmative changing its plan in the round in order to avoid <b>the</b> <b>disadvantage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. <b>The</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>disadvantages</b> {{posed by}} his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough {{connected}} for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could have maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. <b>The</b> <b>disadvantages</b> were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>disadvantage</b> is {{that such}} {{balloons}} require much stronger materials than non-pressurized types.|$|R
5000|$|One {{strategy}} the affirmative may use {{in order to}} attack <b>the</b> <b>Disadvantage</b> is to [...] "straight turn it." [...] To straight turn something means to run only offensive arguments against it. Such an example would be to run 3 impact turns against a <b>Disadvantage.</b> This forces <b>the</b> negative team to not kick <b>the</b> <b>Disadvantage</b> because it automatically becomes an extra advantage for the affirmative. If the affirmative did run defensive arguments such as non-unique and an impact turn, then the negative could concede that it is non-unique so the impact turn would be rendered useless thus the negative could kick out of <b>the</b> <b>disadvantage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In some {{sections}} of <b>the</b> country, politics <b>disadvantages</b> are frowned upon because they link to virtually every affirmative plan, destroying the on case debate and focusing solely on <b>the</b> <b>disadvantage.</b> Supporters, however, say <b>the</b> politics <b>disadvantages</b> are [...] "real world" [...] and provide education on how bills are passed {{and politics in}} general.|$|R
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. <b>The</b> <b>disadvantages</b> are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and <b>the</b> <b>disadvantages,</b> including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. <b>The</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of {{national}} division were becoming increasingly apparent in various {{segments of the}} society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were {{the activities of the}} Silesian dukes Henry I the Bearded, his son Henry II the Pious, who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the Battle of Legnica, and Henry IV Probus. In 1295, Przemysł II of Greater Poland became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Bolesław II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including Gdańsk Pomerania from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, Václav II of Bohemia of the Přemyslid dynasty, who married Przemysł's daughter Richeza and became King of Poland in 1300. Václav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. <b>The</b> <b>disadvantages</b> are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{advantages}} for postalcoholic fermentation answer <b>the</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of early inoculation (namely less antagonism and potential for undesirable byproducts).
