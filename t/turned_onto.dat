5|$|From 1915, Summer Hill {{was served}} by trams from Hurlstone Park. Trams left New Canterbury Road {{and went down}} Prospect Road, then swung right onto Smith Street. They <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> Lackey Street, where they went right and {{terminated}} at the station. Low usage and rival buses saw the line closed in 1933, however some remains can be seen.|$|E
5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} October 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north. It gradually intensified and turned to the northeast, becoming a cyclonic storm on October 20. The storm became the second severe cyclonic storm of the season the following day, and <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> a more northerly track towards the Ganges Delta. The storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of October 23. The storm then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on October 24.|$|E

5|$|NY63 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The initial routing of NY63 was significantly different from its modern alignment; in fact, the only portion of modern NY63 that still follows its original alignment is the section between Hampton Corners and Pavilion. South of Mount Morris, the route followed what is now NY408 to Dalton and continued south on Old State Road and west on Allegany County's CR16 to NY19 west of the village of Angelica. NY63 overlapped NY19 south to Belvidere, where NY63 <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> modern CR20. It continued west on CR20 and NY446 through Cuba to a junction with NY16 in Hinsdale, where it ended. North of Pavilion, NY63 followed modern NY19 to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Hamlin.|$|E
5|$|The crowd regained their resolve and, as {{the body}} marched near Harrison and Frederick streets, they were {{attacked}} in the rear and made to halt by the pressing of the crowd. Without orders, some soldiers fired on the crowd, killing one and wounding between one and three. The crowd shrank back and the soldiers were allowed continue until they had advanced to {{the offices of the}} newspaper, the Baltimore American, near Holliday Street, where an order was given to halt and two volleys fired into the crowd. They were forced to halt a third time as they <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> Charles Street, and again fired on the crowd near Light Street. There two men and one boy were killed. From there they followed Charles to Camden Street and on to the station.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E

5|$|Rameses is {{voiced by}} Sayed Badreya and an {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. Shortly after Drake is knocked out by Rameses, he {{is taken to}} a shipyard where he is tied to a chair. Rameses demands Drake to tell him where Atlantis of the Sands is located. When Drake tells Rameses that he honestly did not know, Rameses walks out and threatens to interrogate Sully. After Drake manages to break free and defeat all of the guards, he climbs onto Rameses' cruise ship. From there he finds a decoy of Sully and realizes that he was never there to begin with. Rameses tells him that he lied - he is after all a pirate. Drake then shoots him, critically wounding him. After Drake makes {{his way into the}} ball room (the ship <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> its side at this point because it was sinking), Rameses shoots the glass window and causes the rest of the ship to flood, dying in the process. Drake however survives by drifting to shore on a piece of flotsam.|$|E
25|$|From Houston Street, {{the presidential}} {{limousine}} made the planned left turn onto Elm Street, allowing it {{access to the}} Stemmons Freeway exit. As the vehicle <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> Elm, the motorcade passed the Texas School Book Depository. Shots were fired at President Kennedy as his motorcade continued down Elm Street. About 80% of the witnesses recalled hearing three shots.|$|E
25|$|Past the Thruway, NY164 {{followed}} a more pronounced southeasterly alignment {{and entered the}} New York City borough of the Bronx, where it became known as Nereid Avenue. The route crossed the Bronx River and proceeded eastward through the Wakefield neighborhood of the Bronx to an intersection with Baychester Avenue. Here, NY164 <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the aforementioned street and followed it southeastward through the northern Bronx. The route went past Seton Falls Park just before it ended at a junction with US1 (Boston Post Road).|$|E

25|$|Another {{piece of}} the Myrtle Avenue Elevated, from the {{crossing}} of the Brooklyn Elevated at Grand Avenue east to Broadway, opened on April 27, 1889. Trains on this route did not cross the line on Grand Avenue, but <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> Grand Avenue and used the Brooklyn Elevated to Fulton Ferry. Simultaneously, the original Brooklyn Elevated route via Lexington Avenue to Fulton Ferry was discontinued, with all Lexington Avenue trains running over Myrtle Avenue to the Brooklyn Bridge, and passengers for the ferry required to transfer at Myrtle Avenue station via several stairways.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{got off to}} a bad {{start on}} May 31 when Longstreet marched down the Charles City Road and <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the Williamsburg Road instead of the Nine Mile Road. Huger's orders had not {{specified}} a time that the attack was scheduled to start and he was not awakened until he heard a division marching nearby. Johnston and his second-in-command, Smith, unaware of Longstreet's location or Huger's delay, waited at their headquarters for word of the start of the battle. Five hours after the scheduled start, at 1 p.m., D.H. Hill became impatient and sent his brigades forward against Casey's division.|$|E
25|$|At 21:14 the Viking {{took off}} from Blackbushe Airport on an {{unscheduled}} passenger flight to RAF Idris in Libya. The aircraft on charter to the War Office had five crew, 25 soldiers from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, one soldier's wife, two children and two war department civilians. At 21:16 the pilot reported I have port engine failure, I am making a left-hand circuit to come in again. As the aircraft <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the approach to land about 1200 yards (1,116 m) from the runway the aircraft crashed into a wooded copse at Star Hill. Thirty-four of the 35 on board were killed.|$|E

25|$|Since {{other routes}} were {{blocked by the}} National Guard, many marchers began to head down Baralt Avenue {{in order to reach}} Miraflores. On Baralt Avenue, near the Llaguno Overpass as the march inched closer {{hundreds}} of Chávez supporters gathered and began throwing large rocks, Molotov cocktails and even tear gas at the demonstrators. As marchers and Chavistas clashed, the Metropolitan Police attempted to separate both sides from further confrontation with two trucks with water cannons. Police motorcycles pushed the opposition towards the Chavistas, and as a police tank <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the main street, gunfire broke out shortly after 3:00pm. By that time, Lameda, Molina Tamayo, Carmona, and CTV leader Carlos Ortega had already left the area.|$|E
25|$|Recent DNA {{analyses}} {{claim they}} revealed traces of blood {{from at least}} four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, {{and was able to}} retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, the Iceman was <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> his stomach in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route7, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Binghamton to Albany via Oneonta and Schoharie. Route7 entered {{the town of}} New Scotland on what is now NY157 and followed it to its eastern end at modern NY85. At this point, the route <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the old Albany–Schoharie plank road and continued east to Albany on New Scotland Road and New Scotland Avenue. The section of legislative Route7 east of modern NY157 was not assigned a posted designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY85, which initially extended from NY81 in the hamlet of Oak Hill {{in the town of}} Durham to US20 in Albany.|$|E

Prior to <b>turning</b> <b>onto</b> College Avenue {{southbound}} the bus stops at Aldi and the Fiesta Square Shopping Center. Now running south the bus turns on to Sunbridge Drive heading west, making stops at Villa Boulevard and Keystone Crossing. Returning briefly on Gregg Avenue the bus runs south before <b>turning</b> <b>onto</b> Poplar Street to stop at the Chestnut Apartments. The bus continues west to meet Leverett Street, which it follows south. The twentieth stop is at the intersection of Leverett and Melmar near the North Creekside Apartments. Passing townhouses the bus continues south along Leverett Street, stopping at Lawson Street before meeting Maple Street and returning to Union Station.|$|R

25|$|Since the incident, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management has {{installed}} additional numerous large {{signs on the}} approaches to Bear Camp Road, warning that the road may be impassable during winter months. Also, the directional sign ("To Gold Beach and Coast") {{at the spot where}} the Kims <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the wrong road, has been moved and replaced. At the spot, the through road is narrow and steeply uphill while the side road is much wider and more level and appears to be the proper continuation. The location and arrow direction on the old sign was confusing and ambiguous, especially in snow when {{it would be impossible to}} see that the narrow uphill road is the correct route while the wide level road is not.|$|E
25|$|NY213 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Originally, NY213 began at NY28 at the west end of the Ashokan Reservoir in Boiceville and followed what is now NY28A southeastward around the reservoir to Olivebridge. Here, it <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> its modern alignment and proceeded eastward to Rosendale, initially the junction of NY213 and NY376, a north–south connector between Rosendale and Dashville. The route continued northeast from Rosendale on modern NY32 to Kingston, where it ended in the western portion of the city. At the time, the segment of modern NY213 between Dashville and Kingston was part of NY32. NY213 was truncated in July1932 to its current western terminus in Olivebridge and rerouted east of Rosendale to follow NY376 and NY32 to Kingston. The former alignment of NY213 north of Rosendale became part of a realigned NY32.|$|E
25|$|Northwest 1482 {{was cleared}} {{from the gate}} towards Runway 03C, but it missed turning onto taxiway Oscar 6 and instead entered the Outer taxiway. To correct the error they were {{instructed}} to turn right onto Taxiway Xray but they <b>turned</b> <b>onto</b> the active runway 03C. They realised the mistake and contacted air traffic for instructions who told them to leave the runway immediately, five seconds later (at 13:45 EST) the crew saw a Boeing 727 heading towards them. The Boeing 727 was operating the Northwest 299 flight to Memphis and had just been cleared for take-off. The 727 wing hit {{the right-hand side of}} the DC-9 and cut through the fuselage just below the windows until it cut off the DC-9's #2 engine. The DC-9 caught fire and was destroyed; the 727 just had a damaged wing and was later repaired.|$|E
