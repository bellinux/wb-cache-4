50|$|A 27-room {{west wing}} was added in 1896, named <b>Klondyke</b> for the <b>Klondike</b> Gold Rush of the time.|$|R
25|$|LA55 {{was created}} with the 1955 renumbering, {{following}} {{the entirety of}} former State Route 81 {{as well as the}} portion of former State Route 69 <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke,</b> just southeast of Bourg.|$|R
2500|$|The highway then {{bends to}} the {{northwest}} with Bayou Terrebonne and continues for a final [...] to an area known as Klondyke, just southeast of Bourg. [...] The route ends at an intersection with LA24, which continues northwest along the bayou toward Houma and east to Larose via the Bourg-Larose Highway. [...] On the southwest, a locally-maintained vertical lift bridge connects <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke</b> Road {{on the opposite side}} of the bayou.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Sheriff McBride and Deputy Haynes were [...] "hugging" [...] {{the northeastern}} {{corner of the}} cabin. At some point, Haynes {{suggested}} that he go check {{the back side of}} the cabin and when he returned he found McBride dead. According to Haynes, empty bullet casings indicated that Tom Sisson had [...] "poked his rifle through a crack in the logs and put three bullets into the sheriff." [...] Haynes then retreated to where the posse had left their horses and after mounting up he rode <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke</b> as fast as he could.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Tr'ochëk was the camp of Chief Isaac, {{the leader of}} the Tr'ondek Hwech'in during the Klondike Gold Rush. The Tr'ondek people used this site {{primarily}} in the summer, hunting moose in the flats across the <b>Klondike</b> and <b>fishing</b> for salmon during their migration up the Yukon.|$|R
5000|$|LA 55 {{was created}} with the 1955 renumbering, {{following}} {{the entirety of}} former State Route 81 {{as well as the}} portion of former State Route 69 <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke,</b> just southeast of Bourg. La 55—From a point at or near Madison Canal through or near Pointe Barre and Montegut to a junction with La 24 at or near Bourg. 1955 legislative route description The route has remained largely the same to the present day, {{with the exception of a}} short extension on the southern end. [...] Since its designation, the roadway has been extended across the Madison Canal about 1.6 mi further south than the original southern terminus.|$|R
60|$|At {{the club}} {{he got into}} more mischief. He met men who wanted to extend a brickfield down by the railway. The brickfield was called Klondyke. James had now a new {{direction}} to run in: down hill towards Bagthorpe, <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke.</b> Big penny-daisies grew in tufts {{on the brink of}} the yellow clay at Klondyke, yellow eggs-and-bacon spread their midsummer mats of flower. James came home with clay smeared all over him, discoursing brilliantly on grit and paste and presses and kilns and stamps. He carried home a rough and pinkish brick, and gloated over it. It was a hard brick, it was a non-porous brick. It was an ugly brick, painfully heavy and parched-looking.|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} the tramway from Pandora mine can be seen running down the hill on and {{embankment}} on the southern side of the Capel Curig road and the stream. As it approaches lake Geirionydd it swings to the right, to cross the present day road, before heading for the lake shore. The route alongside Llyn Geirionydd can be discerned in places today, running along the lake's length between {{the road and the}} lake shore in a small cutting. (This road was not built until about the 1940s.) North of the lake, the tramway route is a flat path, now a right of way, and part of Trefriw trail No. 5, and on the hillside directly above the mill some minor remains of the loading platform, water tank and pipeline can be seen. From here it can be seen where the aerial runway ran steeply down <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke</b> mill.|$|R
5000|$|After the Power {{brothers}} failed <b>to</b> {{arrive in}} <b>Klondyke,</b> Sheriff McBride assembled a posse consisting of himself, Deputy Marshal Frank Haynes, and two sheriff's deputies; Martin Kempton and T. K. [...] "Kane" [...] Wootan. Marshal Haynes carried arrest warrants for John and Tom Power and Sheriff McBride had warrants for Jeff Power and Tom Sisson, who were wanted for questioning {{in connection with}} Ola May's death. On February 9, 1918, the posse drove from <b>Klondyke</b> <b>to</b> the Upchurch Ranch, where they borrowed horses and saddles for the journey south to Power's Cabin.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} {{they had been}} close behind Tom and Ike Furner, this being proven by the remains of campfires and other indications. Once they had met some prospectors {{returning}} <b>to</b> the <b>Klondyke</b> and these men had told of passing the pair ahead, and that Furner had said they were bound for a spot not many miles from Lion Head called Twin Rocks.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a certain}} truth in this observation, {{as the rest of}} them knew, for, after all, it was the outcast and the desperate who first pushed grimly on into the wilderness, up {{tremendous}} defiles and over passes choked with snow, and afterward played a leading part in the Titanic struggle with nature in the strongholds where she had ruled supreme. The wilderness is merciless; the beaten men died, but the rest held on, indomitable; and now those who from the security of a railroad observation-car gaze upon orchard and oat-field, awful gorge and roaring torrent, can dimly realize what the making of that province cost the pioneers who marched into it with famine-worn faces and bleeding feet. That the valor of that army has not yet abated all are sure who know what the vanguard of the last host had to face on the trail <b>to</b> <b>Klondyke</b> a few years ago.|$|R
6000|$|They {{noticed that}} the {{passengers}} were quite a mixed set. Many were mere tourists, taking a round trip to Alaska for sight seeing. Others were Alaskan merchants and traders, who had been [...] "down to the States" [...] on business. Mixed in with the crowd were many men, young and middle-aged, bound for the North to try their luck in the gold fields. The great rush <b>to</b> the <b>Klondyke</b> was {{a thing of the}} past, but new gold fields were being opened continually.|$|R
40|$|In 2003 {{there were}} 4 {{development}} scenarios {{of the city}} Kladno up <b>to</b> 2028 : <b>Klondyke,</b> Burned Land, Well-being and Prosperity. A collapse of city government during the first years is a main feature of the scenarios Klondyke and Burned Land. The values of the indicators of good governance that have been observable in Kladno after four years suggest that these two scenarios cannot come...|$|R
50|$|Graham was {{commissioned}} into the Coldstream Guards {{as a second}} lieutenant on 6 March 1895, and was promoted to lieutenant on 9 January 1898. From March 1899 to 1901 and again in 1902-1904 he served as aide-de-camp to Lord Minto, Governor-General of Canada. In the intervening year, {{he served in the}} Second Boer War in South Africa. He was promoted to captain (supernumerary) on 20 April 1901, and received a regular commission from his regiment in August 1902, as he returned to Canada. Graham kept a journal of his trip across Canada with Minto to the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon in 1900, called Across Canada <b>to</b> the <b>Klondyke,</b> which he later presented to Minto, and which was eventually published. Graham retired from the army in 1904, and became private secretary to the former Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, 1904-06.|$|R
40|$|Petrographic {{analysis}} of the Oligocene-Miocene Zigzag Formation and Miocene Klondyke Formation of the Baguio Mineral District reveals a transitional arc source for the former and an undissected arc source for the latter. Whole rock geochemistry of these sedimentary rock formations show affiliation of the Zigzag Formation to active continental margin whereas the <b>Klondyke</b> Formation appears <b>to</b> have been derived from an oceanic island arc source. A different aspect of the geology of the district is further gleaned from the whole rock rare earth element geochemistry of these rocks. Samples from the Zigzag Formation are characterized by higher REE concentrations compared <b>to</b> the <b>Klondyke</b> Formation samples. The REE data indicate that the sedimentary rocks of the Klondyke Formation had geochemically-less fractionated igneous lithologies as their progenitor whereas the older Zigzag Formation was derived from a more differentiated source. This new set of information contributes {{to the understanding of}} the evolution of this district from a marginal basin to an island arc setting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|The Welsh Crown Spelter company still {{retained}} {{a few men}} on its books, to safeguard its assets, and a catalogue of these assets was prepared. In June 1907 an auction advertisement (see bottom picture) subsequently appeared in the Mining Journal, selling many of the mechanical assets of the Welsh Crown Spelter Co., and divided into 'Electrical Mining Plant', mostly from Pandora mine and 'Dressing Plant', from <b>Klondyke</b> mill. Pertinent <b>to</b> the <b>Klondyke</b> operation, this sale included the like of 100 tons of 18 lb flat-bottom rail, a petrol locomotive of 22.5" [...] gauge, 25 side-tip wagons, and 800' of Henderson cableway. The dressing plant on offer included a stone breaker and several jiggers, pulleys and belts, the contents of smiths' and carpenters' shops, telephone installations, drawing instruments, office and household furniture, and a pony and trap. It {{is clear from the}} full list of auction items that the mill was very dependent on electricity for its operation. This may also have contributed to the decline, for pumping equipment in particular was prone to failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company had}} grand plans for {{expanding}} {{the production of}} Pandora mine, which already had dressing floors immediately south of the lane (between Llyn Geirionydd & Capel Curig). Most prominent in the scheme was {{the construction of a}} new, large dressing mill at <b>Klondyke,</b> <b>to</b> which the ore would be carried on a 2-mile tramway, before descending by aerial runway from the hillside above into the upper floor of the mill itself. Much of this tramway was level, and it is known that the company had a 22½" [...] gauge Kerr Stuart petrol locomotive. It is logical to assume that it worked the tramway.|$|R
50|$|As Klondyke Collieries Limited, coke {{production}} at the site flourished. Although {{it is not known}} exactly when coke production recommenced at the site, records state in 1942 several new coke ovens were constructed at <b>Klondyke</b> <b>to</b> meet the increased demand for coke for smelting purposes. Records show in 1945 and 1946, Klondyke and Bowen in northern Queensland were the only coke producers in Queensland with Klondyke turning out approximately a sixth of Queensland's coke production. In 1948 the site changed hands again and was renamed Moreton colliery and worked until the early 1950s which was when the pit's supply was exhausted. After the closure of the site, coke production was taken over by the nearby Haighmoor site which remained in production for a further 15 years as Queensland's only cokeworks other than Bowen.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Mihi Ovens" [...] and {{adjacent}} Klondyke Coke Ovens were fenced and partially cleared of pest vegetation by DERM {{under the supervision}} of DERM heritage officers between February and April 2010. Stumps and root structures of all large trees and plants remains to help maintain the structural integrity of the surrounding soils and the ovens themselves. The alignment of the fence follows the topography of the area and encompasses the predicted extent of the oven battery, the two unidentified brick structures located above the oven batteries, a section of low retaining wall on the lower terrace area to the south of the ovens, {{and a number of other}} elements thought to relate to the coke manufacturing operations. The [...] "Mihi Ovens" [...] fence is an extension of the existing fencing for the Klondyke Coke Ovens erected by DERM in 2009. It runs adjacent to Parker Lane in the north, then downhill in a southerly direction before running in a southeast direction <b>to</b> rejoin the <b>Klondyke</b> Coke Ovens fence.|$|R
5000|$|Thanks to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, {{we have a}} {{first-hand}} {{description of}} Pullen Burry. Conan Doyle wrote of him in an article [...] "Early Psychic Experiences", published in Pearson's Magazine, March,1924. It's reproduced in part in occult historian Ellic Howe's book on The Golden Dawn.from Conan Doyle:"There was a small doctor dwelling near me, small in stature, and also I fear, in practice. Pullen Bury sic was the name. He was {{a student of the}} occult, and my curiosity was aroused by learning that he had one room in his house which no one entered but himself, as it was reserved for mystic and philosophic purposes."Ellic Howe continues the story, [...] "Pullen Burry suggested that Conan Doyle should join the G.D., but did not reveal its name. Conan Doyle described an unusual dream which he appeared to equate with an 'astral visit' made by some member of the order to discover {{whether or not he was}} a suitable candidate. He decided not to ask for admission." [...] Another occult historian, R.A. Gilbert, mentions Conan Doyle's meetings with Pullen Burry occurred in 1898. Gilbert further quotes Conan Doyle as saying he in fact found his apparent astral examination [...] "queer and disagreeable". A month or two later, Pullen Burry brought G.D. member Dr. Felkin (see Robert Felkin) to see him. The Doyle article records his two visitors' extraordinary conversation about an 'astral journey' they had made together to Central Africa."from Conan Doyle's article: [...] "To return to the little doctor, he went out <b>to</b> the <b>Klondyke</b> sic and I lost sight of him for a long time. From what I learnt, I should judge that the powers of this society included that of loosening their own etheric bodies [...] "etheric body", in summoning the etheric bodies of others (mine for example), and in making thought images ... But their line of development or philosophy is beyond me. I was destined to meet Pullen Burry again, for when I was in America last year I found him full of Rosicrucian lore and occult knowledge." ...|$|R
5000|$|White {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in the mid-19th century, taking up prospecting and later mining and ranching in the 1890s. In 1909, Jeff Power and his family homesteaded in Rattlesnake Canyon and began mining nearby. When two of Power's sons, Tom and John Power, failed to report when drafted into World War I, Sheriff Robert F. McBride of Graham County delivered {{a letter to the}} Powers asking them to come in for prosecution, but it was ignored. Several weeks later, on the night of February 9, 1918, Deputy United States Marshal Frank Haynes, Sheriff McBride, and Deputy Sheriffs Martin Kempton and TK [...] "Kane" [...] Wootan arrived at the Power's cabin near the Power's Mine. They carried arrest warrants for Tom and John Power for draft evasion, and warrants for Jeff Power and his hired man, Tom Sisson, who were wanted for questioning. Just before dawn on February 10, as he was preparing breakfast, Jeff heard two of their horses gallop by their dogs began barking. When Jeff Power stepped outside with his rifle Deputy Sheriff Wootan yelled, [...] "Throw up your hands! Throw up your hands!" [...] A furious gunfight ensued, leaving Sheriff McBride, Deputy Sheriffs Kempton and Wootan, and Jeff Power dead. Marshal Haynes escaped <b>to</b> nearby <b>Klondyke,</b> Arizona, while the Power boys and Tom Sisson fled south to Redington on the San Pedro River. They entered Mexico south of Hachita, New Mexico, where on March 8 they surrendered to a United States Army patrol that had picked up their trail and crossed the border in pursuit. At their trial, all three men were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Sisson died in prison at the age of 86, but the Power brothers were paroled in 1960, forty-two years after their conviction. They were pardoned by Governor Jack Richard Williams nine years later. In 1975, the Power's Cabin was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
40|$|Historic mine {{tailings}} pose a significant health risk to surrounding ecosystems and communities {{because of high}} residual concentrations of contaminant metals. The initial tailings mineral assemblage, metal sulfides, silicates, and carbonates are unstable at earth surface conditions and undergo oxidative and proton-promoted weathering. The weathering of metal sulfides generally produces acid that, if not balanced by protonconsuming dissolution of silicates and carbonates, leads to progressive acidification. The Klondyke State Superfund Site in Graham County, Arizona contains high concentrations of Pb (up to 13 g kg⁻¹) and Zn (up to 6 g kg⁻¹), and remains unvegetated 50 years after mining cessation. Field-scale investigation revealed {{a wide range of}} pH (2. 5 - 8. 0) and plant-available (DTPA-extractable) metals in the near surface of the tailings pile. Four samples were chosen for in-depth characterization ranging in pH, as denoted by subscript, from 2. 6 to 5. 4. The mineral transformations occurring in these four samples were investigated using a variety of techniques and the data indicated an increase in tailings weathering extent with increasing acidification (decreasing pH). Lead speciation, studied by a combination of chemical sequential extraction and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, was found to vary with tailings depth. The principle lead-bearing mineral was plumbojarosite (PbFe₆(SO₄) ₄(OH) ₁₂), with smaller amounts of anglesite (PbSO₄) and lead-sorbed iron-oxide. Anglesite, the most bioavailable mineral form of Pb in the tailings, was found to accumulate at the tailings surface, which has important implications for health risks. Total Zn content decreased by an order of magnitude (from 6 to 0. 4 g kg⁻¹) and showed a change in molecular speciation with decreasing pH. Zinc-rich phyllosilicates and Zn-containing manganese oxides predominate at high pH, whereas low pH samples contained principally Zn-sorbed iron oxides. One of the overarching goals of the project is <b>to</b> remediate the <b>Klondyke</b> site using phytostabilization to keep contaminant metals from eroding offsite either by wind or water transport mechanisms. However, the impacts of plant growth on metal bonding environment are unknown. To address that gap in knowledge, we have developed a technique for the study of root-microbe-mineral-metal interactions that occur in the rhizosphere, the volume of soil surrounding, and affected by, plant roots. This technique involves the conjunctive use of fluorescence in-situ hybridization, X-ray fluorescence elemental mapping, XAFS and Raman micro-spectroscopies, and electron microscopy on single roots. Manganese and iron root plaques collocalized with elevated Pb, Zn, and Cr demonstrate that the rhizosphere can affect metal speciation. Metal speciation {{is an important factor in}} determining metal bioavailability, and thus is critical for understanding the health risk associated with {{mine tailings}}. The results of this research provides site-specific information about Pb and Zn speciation, which will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of site remediation within the context of metal toxicity...|$|R
