Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. He was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes on its back and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> on telegony, referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E

25|$|By this time, Maeser {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as president by the Board of Trustees. He had been called to oversee the entire LDS education program, {{and was unable to}} do both jobs. The Board's initial choice was the twenty-seven-year-old James E. Talmage, but before they could extend the invitation, he was hired by LDS College in Salt Lake City. They instead chose a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, Benjamin Cluff, Jr.. Cluff's methods as president have been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism had a lot to offer the school.|$|E

25|$|Canals’ historiographic {{writings}} {{are mostly}} essays, scattered across various periodicals, usually Cristiandad, and later gathered together in compact volumes. The first major work published was his scaled down PhD thesis Cristianismo y revolución: los orígenes románticos del cristianismo de izquierdas (1957); {{the work was}} centred on Felicite de Lammenais, {{considered one of the}} founding fathers of Liberal Catholicism. Almost 40 years later Canals published La tradición catalana en el siglo XVIII: ante el absolutismo y la Ilustración (1995), the work discussing birth of Catalan Traditionalism as response <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> imported from France. A minor Miscelánea (1997) was followed by Catalanismo y tradición catalana (2006), a booklet which contained a set of 8 essays, focused on history of Catalan identity. Some volumes of the currently issued Obras Completas series are supposed to re-publish historiographic Canals’ writings.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{also had}} {{good reasons for}} discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable {{sanitary}} conditions, long hours at work (on {{the eve of the}} war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11–12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> about the social and political order.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} history throughout Brazil {{is relevant to}} the changing theories of art's purpose and the consequential role that Modernist artists played. There were not many art institutions in Brazil and the country lacked a long theory of art technique that was institutional in other countries such as France with the Academie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century there was dissent in Rio's National School of Fine Arts and it was threatened to be closed by the Republicans who wanted all people who desired to become artists would have the ability to do so. This stemmed somewhat of a revolution where society became more receptive <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> by 1890. However, people who were too tied to the emperor were left from the artistic and cultural spectrum. By the 1920s there was a desire for a more specified and formal reconsideration of the arts and São Paulo was especially prominent in this area. However, along with the desire for renovation came the equally strong loyalty to a realistic portrayal of Brazilian life and culture.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{functioning as a}} spiritual conversion narrative, The Autobiography of Malcolm X also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives. This aesthetic decision {{on the part of}} Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the Norton Anthology of African American Literature assert that, [...] "Malcolm's Autobiography takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> requiring fresh kinds of expression." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the princely states, free imperial cities, nominally {{under the control of}} the Emperor but really ruled by councils that acted like sovereign governments, were scattered throughout the Empire. As the Reformation took root, clashes broke out in many cities between local reformers and conservative city magistrates. It was in a free imperial city, Strasbourg, that Martin Bucer began his work. Located on the western frontier of the Empire, Strasbourg was closely allied with the Swiss cities that had thrown off the imperial yoke. Some had adopted a reformed religion distinct from Lutheranism, in which humanist social concepts and the communal ethic played a greater role. [...] Along with a group of free imperial cities in the south and west of the German lands, Strasbourg followed this pattern of Reformation. It was ruled by a complex local government largely under the control of a few powerful families and wealthy guildsmen. In Bucer's time, social unrest was growing as lower-level artisans resented their social immobility and the widening income gap. [...] The citizens may not have planned revolution, but they were receptive <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> that might transform their lives.|$|E

Along with Babakotia, a new species of Mesopropithecus, M. dolichobrachion, was also discovered, but not formally described until 1995. The same team has also helped promote new ideas about sloth lemur adaptations and the relationships among the four genera. [...] They have also provided evidence that living species, such as the indri and the greater gamboo lemur, have lost much of their original range. [...] In 2009, a new species of large sloth lemur, called Palaeopropithecus kelyus, was described from northwestern Madagascar by a Franco-Madagascan team. [...] The new species was found to be smaller than the two previously known species from the genus, and its diet reportedly consisted of more hard-textured food. [...] The resurgence in subfossil lemur work has also sparked new interest in Madagascar's small mammals, which have also been found at the subfossil sites.
