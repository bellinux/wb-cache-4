40|$|ABSTRACT: Holocene beach-ridge {{development}} {{has produced a}} sequential constriction of many of Georgia's tidal inlets. Inlet constrictions were produced as marginal spits en-croached {{on both sides of}} many of Georgia's inlets. The constriction of the inlets appeared to be a response to retreating shorelines, seasonal reversals in longshore sediment transport, localized flood channel deposition, and decreasing lagoonal <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms</b> caused by marsh deposition. While the inlets were contracting along their horizontal axes, they were expand-ing along their vertical axes. The slow retreat of the shoreline produced by the Holocene transgression was expressed by washover deposits in low-lying areas and bluff development in other areas. Sediment was transported away from the bluffs by longshore currents and was deposited in sand bodies on the margins of tidal inlets. Seasonally reversing longshore currents and flood-dominated channeling permitted accretion on both margins of many inlets. Reversing tidal currents produced sediment accumulations landward of the inlets and tidal deltas seaward of inlets.

Updrift inlet migration governed recurved-spit formation, {{and changes in}} ebb-tidal-delta size and shape resulted {{in the formation of}} a bulge at the island terminus. Sustained updrift migration of the ebb-tidal delta resulted in a commensurate position shift of the bulge and eventually in flattening of the coastline. Regional coastal-management measures have had a strong influence on tidal-inlet and ebb-tidal-delta behavior, and therefore also on the changing shape {{of southwest}} Texel. Identification of relationships between ebb-tidal-delta behavior and changing barrier-terminus erosion-and-accretion patterns on a decadal to century time scale contributes to our understanding of coastal-system dynamics. Any barrier terminus with preserved sets of dune ridges holds a potential record on past ebb-tidal-delta orientations, which provide clues on past changes in <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms</b> and wave versus tide dominance. Under the current ebb-tidal-delta configuration, the entire westward-oriented coast of southwest Texel is too exposed for lasting accretion.

40|$|Intermittently Closed/Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a {{particularly}} dynamic form of estuary characterised by periodic entrance closure to the ocean. Closure {{occurs when a}} subaerial sand berm stabilises across the entrance channel during times of low fluvial discharge. ICOLLs are of global importance as they provide valuable ecological habitats for many species and {{are associated with a}} wide range of management issues due to their cycle of entrance closure and opening. ICOLLs are found to be more widespread globally than previously described with 1477 of these estuaries being identified in this study. This constitutes an estimated 3 % of the world's estuaries and 15 % of all estuaries along microtidal coastlines. ICOLLs are concentrated along microtidal to low mesotidal coastlines in the mid-latitudes and predominantly on coasts with temperate climates. This distribution is related to greater wave heights as driven by high intensity winds and a longer fetch distance. The highest proportion of ICOLLs are present in Australia (21 % all global ICOLLs), South Africa (16 %) and Mexico (16 %). In Australia, a comparison with fluvial input found that it is less important than marine processes in determining ICOLL formation and that ICOLLs are associated with a relative tidal range of < 3. 22.

The model is simulating the reference years 2009 – 2011. An overview of <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms</b> and residual volume fluxes of the main inlets and their variability is given. In addition, data from an intensive observational campaign in a tidal channel south of the island of Spiekeroog as well as satellite images and observations of sea surface properties from a ship of opportunity are used for the skill assessment. Finally, the intensity of estuarine overturning circulation and its variability in the tidal gullies are quantified and analyzed as function of gravitational and wind straining using various estimates including Total Exchange Flow (TEF). Regional differences between the gullies are assessed and drivers of the estuarine circulation are identified. For some inlets, the longitudinal buoyancy gradient dominates the exchange flow, for some others wind straining is more important. Also the intensity of tidal straining (scaled covariance of eddy viscosity and vertical shear) depends on buoyancy gradient and wind forcing in different ways, depending on local topography, orientation toward the main wind direction, and influence by freshwater run off inside or outside the tidal basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{coastline}} of NW Iberia presents many rias, or drowned valleys, {{subject to}} a large tidal range (with maxima {{in the order of}} 4 m). The resulting <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms</b> combine with the geography of the rias to produce substantial tidal currents—in excess of 2 m/s in certain areas. The determination of these areas and the assessment of the tidal stream resource in them is best carried out by implementing a numerical model of the ria in question; this is no easy task—in addition to the tidal forcing, the ria hydrodynamics are influenced by river discharges, winds and baroclinic effects. The application of numerical modelling to the assessment of the tidal stream resource will be exemplified in the talk with a study case: the Ria de Muros, a large coastal embayment (125 km 2) in the Rias Baixas region. A finite-difference numerical model solving the vertically-integrated Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics and transport equations is implemented on a Cartesian grid with variable resolution. After validation based on sea level and velocity measurements, the model is applied to compute the flow throughout the ria at different tidal stages. The largest current values are found in a narrow section of the inner ria; two study sites in this section are selected for a more detailed assessment. The model is run again to compute the tidal stream at the sites during a 14 -day period, so as to cover the spring-neap cycle.

The construction of quantitative food webs and their analysis by means of Ecological Network Analysis provides outputs {{that have been used}} in many studies to assess system development, stress, robustness, resilience and maturity. Here we attempt to relate to the physical characteristics of the environment, ecosystem indices derived from Ecological Network Analysis. Ten models of food webs were gathered, across a selection of soft-bottom estuaries representative of a large morphological and hydrodynamic diversity, from wave-dominated to mixed energy tide-dominated systems. The selection allowed the comparison of their derived Ecological Network Analysis indices, because of similarities of accuracy in the representation of detritus and bacteria, and because models took into account all trophic levels up to top-predators. In order to obtain comparable physical characteristics, global models were used for a homogeneous description of tide and <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms.</b> Spearman correlations, hierarchical ascendant clustering and Redundancy Analysis were applied {{to examine the relationship between}} Ecological Network Analysis indices and physical characteristics. The set of four physical variables selected (catchment area, tidal range at neap tide, index of tide-wave domination and latitude in absolute value) explained 67 % of the structure of the Ecological Network Analysis indices. This implies that the physical forcing related to climate, hydrodynamics and morphology is essential for determining the ecological emergent properties of the food web. In the European policy context of determining the ‘good ecological status’ of coastal ecosystems, it implies that the use of Ecological Network Analysis indices for basing the determination of operational indicators should be done, taking into account this context of a strong influence of physical factors...|$|R

This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of an integrated regional study of sediment exchanges between land and sea along a relatively unspoiled section of coastline in southern N. S. W. The regional climate is a temperate one with no seasonal moisture deficiency, while the shoreline is subject to a microtidal, high energy swell regime. Grainsize distribution, quartz roundness and sand mineralogy of sediments collected from fourteen rivers, their estuaries and the impounding barrier sands are analysed {{in order to determine the}} source(s) of local coastal sands. The factors and processes which control sediment distribution patterns in the three environments are also considered. Comparatively angular, poorly sorted river sands and gravels with significant proportions of non-quartz minerals are deposited at the heads of smaller estuaries as deltas. River mud accumulates on estuary floors as prodelta deposits or is flushed through the system and dispersed at sea. Estuary basin floors have been partly buried by landward prograding flood tide deltas whose sands are derived from the rounded, well sorted, predominantly quartzose sands which dominate most of the coastal embayments. Four estuaries have been infilled to the extent that terrigenous sands now travel through them to the sea. At two localities, advanced infilling reflects the dominance of fluvial activity, at another two, flood tide currents have performed the same role. Rates of terrigenous infilling are explained mainly by runoff and lithological characteristics of the drainage basins. Maximum infilling has occurred where large rivers drain granite catchments. Rates of infilling from seawards are greatest where inlet closure is least likely, a situation favoured by large <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms,</b> persistent stream flow and lower levels of incident wave power. In essence, most of the estuaries are sediment traps for both terrigenous and marine sands at the present time. Delivery of sand to the beaches from the continental shelf appears to have ceased; headland erosion is an unimportant source. Carbonate sands are a minor component of the coastal sediments. As estuary infilling nears completion, the potential for delivery of terrigenous sand to the sea by coastal rivers may be realised.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{laboratory}} experiments carried out in a large experimental apparatus aimed at reproducing a typical lagoonal environment subject to tidal forcings. The experiments were designed {{in order to improve}} our understanding of the main processes governing tidal network initiation and its progressive morphodynamic evolution. In particular, the experiments summarized herein aimed at understanding the physical processes, as well as boundary and initial conditions, which lead to the initiation and subsequent development of a tidal channel network, starting from a plane horizontal tidal flat located behind a barrier island and connected through the sea by a single inlet. During the experiments we observed the growth and development of tidal networks and analyzed their most relevant geomorphic features, taking into account the role played by the characteristics of the tidal forcing in driving the development of channelled patterns. The experimental evidence suggests that general network evolution is substantially characterized by three processes: (1) channel elongation via headward growth, driven by the exceedance of a critical bottom shear stress; (2) incision and sinuosity gradually increasing with channels age; (3) formation of new lateral creeks and tributaries. The lack of external sediment supply, the absence of vegetation, and the prevalence of bedload transport prevented any deposition processes and lateral surface accretion, attributing a purely erosive character to the experimental lagoon. Nevertheless, the morphodynamic feedbacks occurring in the erosional case are essentially the same that occur under depositional conditions. In fact, in both cases, channel excavation is closely connected to concentration of tidal fluxes within the channel network during maximum ebb phase when maximum velocities and shear stresses are reached. In this experimental lagoon the main morphodynamic process responsible for tidal network initiation and development is the differential erosion between the channels and the adjacent surface. The synthetic networks display geomorphic features which compare favourably with those of actual networks, thus emphasizing that our experimental framework is a useful tool for analyzing the processes governing the formation and evolution of tidal networks. In particular, the synthetic networks display width-to-depth ratios and seaward exponential widening and deepening in accordance with observational evidence. Furthermore they reproduce statistical network characteristics of geomorphic relevance, such as the exponential probability distribution of unchanneled path lengths. Finally, we analyze the effects of mean sea level variations on channel network dynamics, focusing on the changes of the relevant geomorphic characteristics of the experimental networks, such as e. g. probability distributions of unchanneled lengths and flowing <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms...</b>|$|R

Historically, the fluvial sediments below the weir have been restrictive to navigation. After the declaration of the national park, the trustees were concerned to facilitate boat access to the new park and consequently training walls were built.

50|$|Like other {{estuaries}} {{along the}} Oregon Coast, Netarts Bay experiences semi-diurnal tides (two high tides and two low tides per day). At mean low low water (the lower low tide), the bay contains approximately 113 million cubic ft of water. Contrasting that with that a mean higher high tide volume of approximately 450 million cubic feet, the bay's <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> is about 33 million cubic feet. The tidal range varies between 1.5 and 3 meters(5 - 9 feet), which can vary {{the amount of}} water (40-90%) flushed out of the estuary during each tidal cycle. With a mean tidal period of 745 minutes, bay waters turn over, on average, twice a day. Mixing within the estuary is dependent on local winds and tides. Horizontal mixing is limited, although vertical mixing is strong. Little to no vertical variations in temperature and salinity prevent density-driven current velocities, indicating that Netarts Bay is a well-mixed estuary.

40|$|The North Sea is {{a shallow}} sea on the Eurasian {{continental}} shelf. This study {{focuses on the}} temporal development of the tidal range {{in the southern part}} of the North Sea. Records of annual tidal range data from gauging stations along the Dutch coast show in general an increasing trend perturbed by random fluctuations. Changes in tidal ranges are caused by natural (periodic) processes and anthropogenic effects. To examine the impact of human measures on the tidal range, the natural components are separated from the recorded tidal range. The only natural cycle significantly present in annual mean tidal range records is the nodal tide with a period of 18. 6 yr and amplitudes of 0. 2 - 2. 0 %. The short-term (few years) fluctuations are qualitatively similar for different stations with individual peaks occurring at the same time. This indicates that the noisy signal is caused by regional processes and not by measurement errors (as is not expected using annual mean values). The residual tidal range shows that apart from noise the tidal range remained constant form the early 19 th century till circa 1955. During the period 1955 - 1980 a gradual increase in tidal range is observed at all stations. Although differences exist between the stations, their trends are very similar. Because the short-term and the long-term developments are similar, it is meaningful to construct an artificial average of the tidal range records from different stations. In this study the average of the Dutch stations and the average of the German stations are compared. The analysis shows that a similar gradually increasing trend is observed at the Dutch and German coast. The hypothesis that this trend is caused by coastal engineering in the River Rhine delta, is tested. A conceptual model is applied in which the North Sea is schematised to a rectangular basin. Estuaries with <b>tidal</b> <b>prisms</b> corresponding to Zeeland estuaries are included in this model. The model shows that the tidal range increases at the mouth of the estuary when it is closed. This increase decays along the Dutch coast with a typical length with an order of magnitude of 150 km. The results of the conceptual model are supported by a detailed model study incorporating the shape of the coast line and the bathymetry [LANGENDOEN, E. J. (1987) Onderzoek naar de vergroting van het tijverschil te Vlissingen. Faculteit der Civiele Techniek. Delft, TU Delft]. Both analyses suggest strong evidence that the tidal range is not significantly affected north of Den Helder after a closure of an estuary in the Zeeland delta. This implies that the observed trend at the Dutch and German coast does not have as common cause coastal engineering in the River Rhine delta. A satisfactory explanation for the trend since 1955 is not given in this report. However, our results suggest that the most likely cause is complex changes in the oceanic and the shelf sea system due to meteorological and astronomic changes.

The question on whether the morphological features of a tidal landscape retain signatures of past environmental forcings, or are in equilibrium with current ones, is critical to our prediction of the fate of residual tidal landforms. In the case of tidal networks, the issue is quite relevant owing to their fundamental role on landscape eco-morphodynamic evolution. Here we explore the response of tidal networks to cyclic variations in RMSL triggering <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> changes {{on the basis of}} laboratory experiments carried out in a synthetic lagoonal environment. A decrease in the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> leads to network retreat and contraction of channel cross sections.

40|$|The {{long-term}} (10 – 100 years) {{evolution of}} tidal channels {{is generally considered}} {{to interact with the}} bio-geomorphic evolution of the surrounding intertidal platform. Here we studied how the geometric properties of tidal channels (channel drainage density and channel width) change as (1) vegetation establishes on an initially bare intertidal platform and (2) sediment accretion on the intertidal platform leads to a reduction in the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> (i. e. water volume that during a tidal cycle floods to and drains back from the intertidal platform). Based on a time series of aerial photographs and digital elevation models, we derived the channel geometric properties at different time steps during the evolution from an initially low-elevated bare tidal flat towards a high-elevated vegetated marsh. We found that vegetation establishment causes a marked increase in channel drainage density. This is explained as the friction exerted by patches of pioneer vegetation concentrates the flow in between the vegetation patches and promotes there the erosion of channels. Once vegetation has established, continued sediment accretion and <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> reduction do not result in significant further changes in channel drainage density and in channel widths. We hypothesize that this is explained by a partitioning of the tidal flow between concentrated channel flow, as long as the vegetation is not submerged, and more homogeneous sheet flow as the vegetation is deeply submerged. Hence, a reduction of the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> due to sediment accretion on the intertidal platform, reduces especially the volume of sheet flow (which does not affect channel geometry), while the concentrated channel flow (i. e. the landscape forming volume of water) is not much affected by the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> reduction...|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [41076001, 40810069004]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2010121029]Xiamen Bay in South China has {{experienced}} extensive coastal exploitation since the 1950 s, resulting in some severe environmental problems. Local authorities now have completed or are implementing many environmental restoration projects. Evaluating the cumulative impact of exploitation and restoration {{activities on the}} environment is a complicated multi-disciplinary problem. However, hydrodynamic changes in the bay caused by such coastal projects can be characterized directly and definitively through numerical modeling. This paper assesses {{the cumulative effect of}} coastal projects on the hydrodynamic setting using a high-resolution numerical modeling method that makes use of tidal current speeds and the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> as two hydrodynamic indices. Changes in tidal velocity and the characteristics of the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> show that hydrodynamic conditions have declined from 1938 to 2007 in the full-tide area. The tidal current speed and <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> have decreased by 40 % {{in the western part of}} the bay and 20 % in the eastern part of the bay. Because of the linear relationship between <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> and area, the degraded hydrodynamic conditions are anticipated to be restored to 1972 levels following the completion of current and proposed restoration projects, i. e. 33 % and 15 % decrease in the hydrodynamic conditions of 1938 for the western and eastern parts of the bay, respectively. The results indicate that hydrodynamic conditions can be restored to some extent with the implementation of a sustainable coastal development plan, although a full reversal of conditions is not possible. To fully assess the environmental changes in a region, more indices, e. g., water quality and ecosystem parameters, should be considered in future evaluations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a visualisation of proposed managed retreat options for a scientiﬁcally important estuarine area within the South Downs National Park, United Kingdom. A range of GIS and remote sensing techniques {{are used to}} facilitate the manipulation of LiDAR data for landscape visualisation. Landscape and ﬂood modelling methods are incorporated and developed. The extent of inundation and <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> are assessed following proposed coastal planning and landscape changes. Ground-truthed LiDAR elevation data are used to model a series of proposed managed retreat scenarios (scenarios A, B, Cand D) for the river Cuckmereestuary. Following detailed landscape visualisation and manipulation, a 'pour-point' ﬂood modelling method is used to simulate tidal inundation and calculate the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> for proposed managed retreat scenarios using current tidal data. Further analysis was undertaken to assess {{the potential impact of}} sea level rise (for the years 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100) in this estuarine area if the managed retreat proposals are actioned. The use of GIS-based techniques to alter and visualise landscape features under proposed managed retreat alternatives proved successful. Clear differences in tidal inundation and the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> were observed following the modelling of large scale engineering features. These differences in inundation were apparent both using current tidal data and predicted sea level rise data. The <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> was strongly affected by the choice of the managed retreat scenario. Subtle changes in landscape features were shown to strongly affect the water accommodation potential of the estuary. The study demonstrates that high resolution data facilitated the detailed visualisation and modelling of ﬁne-scale landscape change. Furthermore, the alteration of landscape features suggested that the area of inundation could potentially vary by over 20 % (> 100 ha); and that these landscape changes would noticeably alter tidal impact in this estuary...|$|E
40|$|After {{the storm}} surge of 1953, the Dutch Delta project was {{initiated}} {{in order to protect}} the southwestern part of The Netherlands. A storm surge barrier in front of the Oosterschelde and various dams at the back of the estuary were constructed. These interventions led to a large change of the hydrodynamics of the Oosterschelde: a large decrease in tidal volume and flow velocities. This decrease in flow velocities caused a decrease in sediment transport from the channels with about 75 %. It is estimated that an amount of 400 - 600 million m 3 of sediment is necessary to increase the flow velocities, restore the sediment transport from the channels and to obtain a new dynamic equilibrium (Kohsiek, 1987). This need for sand is called the ‘sand demand’. At present, the shoal height inside the estuary decreases by wave erosion. This decrease in shoal height mainly has a negative influence on the protected nature in the Oosterschelde. The Oosterschelde was ebb dominant and exporting sediment for centuries. All the events and interventions from 1530 up to the construction of Volkerakdam and Grevelingendam in 1969, caused an increase in <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> and export of sediment towards the ebb tidal delta. By the construction of {{the storm surge}} barrier, Philipsdam and Oesterdam in 1986, the situation changed, the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> decreased and the ‘sand demand’ started. This research is aimed at finding a structural solution for the ‘sand demand’ by opening the storm surge barrier. The present situation of the Oosterschelde and a future situation with a new inlet channel at Neeltje Jans are analyzed in order to determine if a new inlet channel could influence the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in order to structurally solve the ‘sand demand’. A process based hydrodynamic and morphological model (Delft 3 D) is used to analyze the present and possible future situations with a new inlet channel. The new model and the methods of Van de Kreeke (1993) and Groen (1967) applied to the present situation of the basin, show that the Oosterschelde is still ebb dominant and would be exporting fine and coarse sediment if the inlet would not block the sediment transport. This ebb dominance follows from the large intertidal area and deep channels. Notwithstanding the ebb dominance, there is no sediment export possible through the inlet. The inlet blocks the sediment transport in both directions mainly because of a ‘tidal jet’, caused by the small inlet and large <b>tidal</b> <b>prism.</b> The <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> increases with a new inlet channel and thus increases the flow velocities in the channels. The increase in <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> and thus flow velocities brings the Oosterschelde closer to the old situation. The higher flow velocities increase the sediment transport from the channels and thus increase the shoal building. It is not known how much the shoal building is exactly restored. Some channels have such an increase in flow velocities that shoal building occurs again. However, parts of the basin are still not in equilibrium, which can be seen from comparing the old with the new flow velocities and by comparing the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> and the cross-sectional areas of the channels with the empirical relations of Louters (1998) and Haring (1976). An important disadvantage of an increase in <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> is the enhancement of the ebb dominance that causes more sediment transport in ebb direction. However there is no export possible through the new inlet channel, because also the new inlet channel has a ‘tidal jet’ that blocks all sediment transport through the inlet. The large-scale effects of the Oosterschelde, like the ebb dominance and ‘sand demand’ cannot be structurally changed a new inlet channel. However the shoal degradation rate will probably be slowed down with an increase in <b>tidal</b> <b>prism.</b> Hydraulic EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Taking Yangshan sea-area of the Qiqu {{archipelago}} as an example, a 2 D {{numerical model}} of tidal currents is established {{to study the}} change of the current field {{and the influence of}} branch blocking in different stages of northern port construction, including tide process, velocity and <b>tidal</b> <b>prism,</b> in the main channel waters and the branches. Verifications with the observed data indicate that the simulated results can reflect the current fields in the region. Based on the numerical model it is rechecked and researched the influence of branch blocking in different stages of northern port construction on the changing processes of hydrodynamic, including tide process, velocity and <b>tidal</b> <b>prism,</b> in the main channel waters and the branches. The paper is to provide the scientific basis for the construction of Yangshan Port’s subsequent engineering...|$|E
40|$|Several {{morphological}} and sedimentological investigations {{were carried}} out along barrier islands in the northern Adriatic (Italy) in order to evaluate the sand reservoir potential associated with ebb-tidal deltas. The classical exponential AeP (cross-sectional area vs. spring <b>tidal</b> <b>prism)</b> relationship was used to draw a synthesis of the hydrodynamic equilibrium conditions and demonstrates that both natural and artificially fixed inlets exhibit the same morphological adaptations to tidal conditions. A new semi-automatic geostatistical GIS procedure was developed to process bathymetrical data. With this, a first estimate of ebb-delta volumes, was obtained. Sand storage potential at natural and almost natural inlets varied considerably, {{as a function of}} the <b>tidal</b> <b>prism,</b> from ca. 0. 27 x 10 ^ 6 to ca. 11 x 10 ^ 6 m 3.

40|$|Equilibrium {{cross-sectional}} {{area is a}} crucial parameter {{in the assessment of}} the stability of tidal inlets; it has been related to <b>tidal</b> <b>prism,</b> through the empirical O'Brien method. Analyses presented here, based upon equations associated with equilibrium, show that other factors (i. e. not <b>tidal</b> <b>prism</b> alone) are also important: (1) flood and ebb tidal durations; (2) freshwater discharges; and (3) sediment transport through the entrance. Analytical approaches are suggested for evaluating tidal inlet equilibrium conditions. The method can be applied to analyse the equilibrium of individual inlets, reducing errors in the application of the O'Brien method. Equilibrium conditions for inlet systems at Langstone Harbour (southern England) and Yangpu Harbour (southern China) are compared, suggesting some deviation from the conclusion that maximum cross-sectional mean current speed for a stable inlet should be around 1 · 0 m s- 1...|$|E
