In a communications ecosystem, human interaction takes place alongside technological, contextual, and business domains, thus producing a holistic view on QoE formation. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between human perceived QoE and "context" for burgeoning 3 -dimensional (3 D) audio <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>services.</b> 3 D audio teleconferencing applications are customizable by generating different virtual acoustic environments (VAE), where parameters such as virtual room size and competing talker conditions can be adjusted for a particular application. The impact of different VAE characteristics on perceived QoE, however, is still unknown. In this study, four QoE factors were investigated across different VAE scenarios. It was found that a) medium-size virtual rooms produce optimal perceived QoE, b) competing talkers of mixed gender could be easily located in the virtual space, and c) competing speaker gender had no significant effect on perceived audio qualit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With the {{availability}} of cloud computing infrastruc-tures, migrating business-critical functionality to public clouds is becoming commonplace. Cloud providers typically {{offer a variety of}} computing capabilities and pricing options. Therefore, the problem of selecting the ones that suit enterprise needs becomes critical. Our major focus is on the migration of enterprise communication services, such as IP-telephony, to the cloud. We design a tool to assist in optimally deciding among the set of available hosting and network connectivity Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) under Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and budget constraints. In particular, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework making use of application-specific QoE estimation tools to tackle with the conflicting objectives of price and quality and demonstrate its application to a cloud-based <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>service</b> as a case study.

40|$|Mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} are characterised by constant topology changes, {{the absence of}} fixed infrastructure and lack of any centralised control. Traditional routing algorithms prove to be inefficient in such a changing environment. Ad-hoc routing protocols such as dynamic source routing (DSR), ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) and destination-sequence distance vector (DSDV) have been proposed to solve the multi hop routing problem in ad-hoc networks. Performance studies of these routing protocols have assumed constant bit rate (CBR) traffic. Real-time multimedia traffic generated by video-on demand and <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>services</b> are mostly variable bit rate (VBR) traffic. Most of these multimedia traffic is encoded using the MPEG standard. (ISO moving picture expert group). When video traffic is transferred over MANETs a series of performance issues arise. In this paper we present {{a performance comparison of}} three ad-hoc routing protocols - DSR, AODV and DSDV when streaming MPEG 4 traffic. Simulation studies show that DSDV performs better than AODV and DSR. However all three protocols fail to provide good performance in large, highly mobile network environments. Further study is required to improve the performance of these protocols in mobile ad-hoc networks offering VBR services. <br /...|$|E

Abstract Today in this new era everyone wants to achieve the goal or target in minimum time as per his schedule, for business purpose, corporate sector, or make a better relationship via meetings either in his personal life. It’s a major challenge for new generation is to provide multimedia <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>services.</b> For this challenge there are special standards have recently populated for signaling and control for Internet teleconferencing. Here discussed on two standards: One is ITU Recommendation H. 323, {{and the other is}} the IETF Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Both signaling protocols are responsible for call setup and call tear down. Several comparisons of these two protocols have been published already, but their service architectures have been rarely addressed. This paper provides a unique architecture based on mechanism, with comparison of H. 323 and SIP both protocol, and focusing on their service architectures. While architecture of both standards are quite similar. Here in this paper focused on considerable differences regarding their transferable and supplementary service.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for next generation IP networks is to provide multimedia <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, {{the introduction of new}} services includes the take over of traditional telephony. Besides the general problems with supporting realtime services in the IP network (e. g. QoS), this puts a special interest on the control of supplementary services and on the mechanisms for their fast and efficient development and deployment. The two most promising approaches in the multimedia over IP area are the protocol suites H. 323 (ITU-T) and SIP (IETF). Several comparisons of these two protocols have been published already, but their service architectures have been rarely addressed. This survey provides a comparison of H. 323 and SIP, focussing on their service architectures. The basic protocol architectures are reviewed, followed by an in-depth evaluation of their service implementation mechanisms. The studies are backed up by detailed examples for the control of supplementary services in H. 323 and SIP. Although the two protocol architectures are quite similar, it is shown that there are considerable differences regarding their supplementary service architectures. H. 323 /H. 450, which is still the more mature standard, has been focussed on supplementary services, smooth interworking with the PSTN and interoperability between different implementations. It has clear advantages for IP telephony applications. SIP has been designed with a broader scope, providing more generic syntax and semantics regarding feature definition and session description. Since the standards do not describe all details for broad range of possible applications and services, this bears the danger of interoperability problems. SIP has advantages for non-VoIP services. A coexistence of both protocols can be foreseen, stressing the importance of interworking between them. ...|$|E

However they are costly and computationally complex. In this paper, we compare the, quality of speech, level of compression and computational complexity of our method of Cepstrum based VAD with the standard GSM and ITU-T G. 729 codecs.

The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare the {{marketing}} campaigns of two teleconferencing programs — British Telecom's Talkabout versus Pacific Northwest Bell's Open Line. Talkabout is the original public entertainment-related <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>service</b> offered to teens in the United Kingdom. It is the program on which many other countries, including the United States, have based their programs. Open Line, Pacific Northwest Bell's party line program was introduced to adults and teens in the Spokane, Washington area in 1984. Through a marketing effort managed by Kobs & Brady Advertising, Open Line was offered free for two weeks to promote the service. A stimulation program was then implemented after the trial to retain callers. Chapter 1 of this thesis discusses the Talkabout service explaining the program's operation, markets and promotional and advertising efforts.

During financial earnings presentations, this remains a top priority for executives who must persuade investors of the soundness and worth of their companies. Taking inspiration from Aristotle’s notions of logos (appeals to rationality) and ethos (appeals to credibility), the study investigates how executives use logical connectives and hyperbole to achieve their goals. These features are analyzed in two corpora of financial earnings presentations given in different interactional settings: face-to-face and via telephone, i. e. conference calls through a <b>teleconferencing</b> <b>service.</b> The methodological approach encompasses both quantitative techniques of corpus linguistics and follow-up qualitative analysis to better interpret the empirical data. In addition, the findings are further illuminated by insights from professional informants who regularly participate in such events.
