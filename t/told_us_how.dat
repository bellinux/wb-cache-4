6000|$|Without {{taking the}} least notice of this inquiry, albeit {{delivered}} in an imposing and forensic manner, Lavinia reminded her sister, 'After all, you know, Bella, you haven't <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> your Whatshisnames are.' ...|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, my counsel {{managed to}} get the true story out of him at last with {{infinite}} patience, dexterity, and skill. The old man <b>told</b> <b>us</b> finally <b>how</b> he had found the coins and sold them to me for five pounds; and how one of them was of gold, with a queer head and goggle eyes pointed full face upon its surface.|$|R
60|$|Somehow we {{slid into}} {{the freedom of the}} will and Jonathan Edwards. I told him that Mill had often <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> Edwards argued the necessarian or determinist case as keenly as any modern.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you {{certainly}} have not <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> 'your little lovers came!'" [...] The captain, however, would not sing any more. And then {{the party was}} broken up, and the Robartses went home to their parsonage.|$|E
60|$|History has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how,</b> shamefaced, tired, dripping, the great, all-powerful {{people of}} Paris quietly slunk {{back to their}} homes, even before the first cock-crow in the villages beyond the gates, {{acclaimed}} the pale streak of dawn.|$|E
60|$|We {{then mounted}} and rode quietly home. Of course, we were chaffed without mercy, {{especially}} {{by the old}} negress, who had foreseen all along, she <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> just <b>how</b> it would be. One would have imagined, to hear this old black creature talk, that she looked on milk-drinking {{as one of the}} greatest moral offences man could be guilty of, and that in this case Providence had miraculously interposed to prevent us from gratifying our depraved appetites.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{what your}} grandpa <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about him, <b>how</b> he took {{good care of}} his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her. And how he {{provides}} now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{man nodded}} meaningly. [...] "That will satisfy me. On the whole, it's lucky the fellow shot {{at you and}} Hulton <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you stood. He didn't miss by much; there's burnt powder {{sticking}} to your cheek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{they ought}} to have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> it was," [...] said Mrs. Parkman. [...] "I think it is a shameful deception, to bring us over in this way, and not let us know any thing about it." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then he went}} on, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> it {{had taken}} him half an hour to land it, and how it had broken his rod. He said he had weighed it {{carefully}} when he reached home, and it had turned the scale at thirty-four pounds.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> anecdotes of <b>how</b> he {{had gone}} across the Channel when it was so rough that the {{passengers}} had to be tied into their berths, and he and the captain {{were the only two}} living souls on board who were not ill. Sometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill; but it was generally he and one other man. If not he and another man, then it was he by himself.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} the “learning {{sciences}} ” have led to new instructional models for teaching and for producing enhanced levels of understanding of scientific concepts, knowledge retention, and innovative problem-solving abilities. Major concepts derived from these investigations are now recognized in the education research communities worldwide. In the present paper we explore studies from the education literature of China, India and the United States, {{in an effort to}} shed light on the following questions: (1) What has recent evidence from education research and the cognitive sciences <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about <b>how</b> instructional methods can be used most effectively to promote student learning and innovative problem-solving abilities? (2) How have differences in history and culture affected application of new instructional strategies in India, China and the United States...|$|R
60|$|And we canvassed everybody. Bailey Aldrich, Marquis of Ponkapog, came in, got nobly drunk, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{all about}} <b>how</b> poor Osgood lost his earldom and was hanged for conspiring against the second Emperor--but he didn't mention how near he himself came to being hanged, too, for {{engaging}} in the same enterprise. He was as chaffy as he was sixty years ago, too, and swore the Archbishop and I never walked to Boston--but {{there was never a}} day that Ponkapog wouldn't lie, so be it by the grace of God he got the opportunity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rejoiced to see you," [...] {{the sheik}} said gravely. [...] "I heard how you had before befriended Sidi, and the {{messenger}} who arrived here <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you had saved {{the lives of}} my brother and nephew, and I wanted to see your face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{he carried}} me {{away in the}} spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem.'

40|$|Managers spend a {{majority}} of their days in face-to-face meetings {{so it is not}} surprising that meeting support is becoming an important focus of information technology. But meetings vary wideIy in size, duration, and location. Some are briqf deskside meetings between two or three people, others are lengthy conference room meetings with a dozen or more participants. Thus, support needs may also vary by size, duration, and location. Surprisingly, past use-of-time studies have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> little about <b>how</b> meetings vary along these dimensions. We review the history of the early studies and present a new diary study to look at these dimensions and their relationships. ...|$|R
60|$|At last, {{hearing of}} a famous cave there is at Oliero, a town some miles further up the Brenta, we {{determined}} to go there, {{and it was a}} fortunate thought, for there we found a nobleman in charge of the cave who <b>told</b> <b>us</b> exactly <b>how</b> to reach the Sette Communi. You pass a bridge to get out of Bassano--a bridge which spans the crystal swiftness of the Brenta, rushing down to the Adriatic from the feet of the Alps on the north, and full of voluble mills at Bassano. All along the road to Oliero was the finest mountain scenery, Brenta-washed, and picturesque with ever-changing lines. Maize grows in the bottom-lands, and tobacco, which is guarded in the fields by soldiers for the monopolist government. Farm-houses dot the valley, and now and then we passed villages, abounding in blonde girls, so rare elsewhere in Italy, but here so numerous as to give Titian that type from which he painted.|$|R
60|$|The next day, {{we set out}} {{to explore}} Anastasia Island, right {{opposite}} the town. It is a big island, but we took our lunch and determined to do what we could. We hired a boat and rowed over to the mouth of a creek in the island. We went up this creek quite a long way, and landed at a little pier, where we made the boat fast. The man who owned the boat <b>told</b> <b>us</b> just <b>how</b> to go. We first made a flying call at the coquina quarries, where they dig the curious stuff of which the town is built. This is formed of small shells, all conglomerated into one solid mass that becomes as hard as stone after it is exposed to the air. It must have taken thousands of years for so many little shell-fish to pile themselves up into a quarrying-ground. We now went over to the light-house, and {{climbed to the top of}} it, where we had a view that made Rectus feel even better than he felt in the cemetery at Savannah.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Benjy, be not so severe. It {{was but a}} slip. Besides, {{our leader}} has not {{forbidden}} our carrying a whole library in our heads, {{so long as we}} take only one book in our pockets. But, uncle, you have not yet <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> you intend to cross that amazing barrier which Benjy has appropriately styled an ice-jumble." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{policeman}} left in {{the room}} was a big, thick-voiced, pompous man, with a horrible unfeeling pleasure in hearing himself talk before an assembly of frightened, silent people. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> he had found her, {{as if he had been}} telling a story in a tap-room, and began with saying: [...] "I don't think the young woman was drunk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The old man {{shook his}} head cunningly. [...] "Na--Na--Na!" [...] he cried. [...] "I know better. Every time I tell my tale men stone me. But, Thanes, I will tell you a greater thing. Listen!" [...] He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> many paces it was from some Saxon Saint's shrine to another shrine, and how many more back to the Abbey of the Battle.|$|E
5000|$|Lilly Cosentino {{remembers the}} priests {{of the parish}} well: [...] "Fr. Ross {{made it clear that}} he did not like the Italians, and during Mrs. Greco's Funeral Mass, he told the {{congregation}} that New York's Sing-Sing prison was full of young Italian boys. When Fr. Ross married my brother Benny years later, my brother reminded him of that callous remark, and Fr. Ross apologized. Fr. Ferris <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that despite <b>how</b> the Catholic Church stressed the need for confession with the priests, we should make our own private confessions to God, kneeling at the altar's Communion rail. Fr. Ferris loved the children of the parish. He was ice-skating with a group of them down at the creek one winter when he suffered a heart attack and died." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{last man}} who {{jumped from the}} wall, Sir Albert, <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that he saw that you were down and that Sir Edgar {{and one of his}} men-at-arms were {{fighting}} like demons over you. Now, Sir Edgar, tell <b>us</b> <b>how</b> the matter ended." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{group also}} {{operates}} outside areas it largely controls using a clandestine cell system. An ISIL-linked senior militant commander in Sinai told Reuters; “They ISIL teach <b>us</b> <b>how</b> {{to carry out}} operations. We communicate through the internet, ... they teach <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to create secret cells, consisting of five people. Only one person has contact with other cells. They are teaching <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to attack security forces, the element of surprise. They <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to plant bombs then wait 12 hours so that the man planting the device has enough time {{to escape from the}} town he is in.” ...|$|R
60|$|We {{sat there}} for half-an-hour, {{describing}} to each other our maladies. I explained to George and William Harris how I felt when I {{got up in the}} morning, and William Harris <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> he felt when he went to bed; and George stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "This was {{not long}} before you came," [...] Featherstone continued. [...] "It was a {{wonderful}} relief to know the danger was over, and then you <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> Lawrence had grown out of his folly and become a useful man. Although we longed to see him, our satisfaction was complete. Now this letter comes, and I fear my wife is unable to bear the strain again." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{suggestion}} that these would {{hardly have been}} destroyed, even without our interposition, fell very flat, for romance must have its swing. Ellen <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>how,</b> on the news of our kinsman's death and our inheritance, the ancestral story had been discussed, and her grandfather had said he believed there were letters {{about it in the}} iron deed-box, and how he hoped to be on better terms with the new heir.|$|E
40|$|Paradise Hotel is {{a popular}} reality-show which can be viewed in many countries. The first Swedish version aired year 2005. Since then Paradise Hotel has {{expanded}} and been written about in the media in respect of the participants’ behavior. We considered this an interesting subject to study and understand what might actually be happening inside the hotel. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine and seek an understanding of the participants in Paradise Hotel season 2014 from a gender perspective. The research question guiding this study was: How is masculinity and femininity constructed on the reality-show Paradise Hotel? The study was conducted through a semiotic analysis where episodes from the season were transcribed with focus from our theories about gender, masculinity and femininity. The result of the study showed that the participants were constructed differently to what the theories <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about <b>how</b> male and female are socially constructed. A more accepting approach was shown towards men when having multiple sexual relationships. Men have also applied a more socially constructed female quality in forms of showing feelings, like crying and being vulnerable. There is a template for how a man should look like in Paradise Hotel, but according to the women men do not achieve this. The women show qualities like dominance, being independent and having the courage to stand up for themselves and make decisions on their own, which is seen like a socially constructed male equality...|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Aboriginal {{people from}} the west coast were still {{relating}} their oral history regarding a massacre, with the recorder of these interviews stating that, [...] "as the Aboriginal oral tradition is of crucial importance to their culture, with traditions handed down from generation to generation, one cannot dismiss their disturbing claims". Foster et al. also interviewed Aboriginal {{people from the}} west coast on several occasions about the incident, with broad agreement in several aspects; the location near Elliston, the numbersabout 250 rounded up and herded over the cliffs, and additionally, {{that not all of}} the people died, but the majority hid {{at the base of the}} cliff until the settlers left. In 2000, the author Iris Burgoyne wrote of the oral history about the massacre: [...] This story was passed to me by my people. Their spoken words were always the truth. As young girls at Koonibba, we sat and listened to the old people like Jack Joonary, Jilgina Jack and Wombardy. They were well over a hundred. They shared many of their experiences. They <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about <b>how</b> they survived the Elliston massacres in about 1839 and 1849. Jack Jacobs from Franklin Harbour, old lame Paddy and Dick Dory spoke about it as well. That day they escaped death as they tricked the European horsemen and ran into the bushes. They stood and watched in horror as their people were driven off the cliffs into the sea. ....|$|R
2500|$|In The Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers,the [...] first {{in-depth}} study of Jeffers not written {{by one of}} his circle, poet and critic J. Radcliffe Squires addresses the question of a reconciliation of the beauty of the world and potential beauty in mankind: “Jeffers has asked us to look squarely at the universe. [...] He has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that materialism has its message, its relevance, and its solace. [...] These are different from the message, relevance, and solace of humanism. [...] Humanism teaches us best why we suffer, but materialism teaches <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to suffer.” ...|$|R
