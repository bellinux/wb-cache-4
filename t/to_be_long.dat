5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E

5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> and lean, modern breed preferences {{are for a}} square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle.

25|$|The {{special status}} of Berlin meant that Lufthansa {{was not allowed}} to fly to either part of Berlin until 1989.

25|$|The {{absolute}} {{value for the}} exposure time required depends on how sensitive to light the medium being used is (measured by the film speed, or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency). Early photography used media that had very low light sensitivity, and so exposure times had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> even for very bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the sensitivity through film cameras and digital cameras.|$|E

25|$|Gayba (Occultation, lit: absence), is a {{term used}} by the Shias {{to refer to the}} {{occultation}} of the Hidden Imam, however, as his occultation is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long,</b> and because believers would be waiting for his rise and reappearance, Mahdi is also called Montazar (the Awaited one). He is also known as Qa'im, whose rise against unjust is awaited. In this sense, it contrasted with qāʿed(lit: the seated one), a term designating previous Imams who did not participate in rebellious movements against Umayyad and Abbasid rule.|$|E

25|$|Vowel {{length is}} not phonemic in Esperanto. Vowels tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> in open {{stressed}} syllables and short otherwise. Adjacent stressed syllables {{are not allowed}} in compound words, and when stress disappears in such situations, it may leave behind a residue of vowel length. Vowel length is sometimes presented as an argument for the phonemic status of the affricates, because vowels tend to be short before most consonant clusters (excepting stops plus l or r, as in many European languages), but long before ĉ, ĝ, c, and dz.|$|E
25|$|Contracts are {{negotiated}} at futures exchanges, which act as {{a marketplace}} between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> position holder, and the selling party {{is said to be}} short position holder. As both parties risk their counter-party walking away if the price goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging a margin {{of the value of the}} contract with a mutually trusted third party. For example, in gold futures trading, the margin varies between 2% and 20% depending on the volatility of the spot market.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the various}} anceps syllables {{in the line}} are not equal.

Therefore what was a short syllable in Greek (i.e. positions 3 and 5) is more often than not long in Latin, but less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> than what was an anceps in the Greek line.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1950s {{the many}} dirt roads and cobbled roads were crucial {{sites in the}} race.

In the Interwar period, Belgium's infrastructure was severely scarred by war and only the intercity roads were smooth. Roads were laid in cobblestones, simply {{because it was the}} cheapest material at the time. After the Second World War, Belgium picked itself up from devastation and provinces began asphalting roads.|$|E
25|$|The vestigial left lung {{is often}} small or {{sometimes}} even absent, as snakes' tubular bodies require {{all of their}} organs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> and thin. In the majority of species, only one lung is functional. This lung contains a vascularized anterior portion and a posterior portion that does not function in gas exchange. This 'saccular lung' is used for hydrostatic purposes to adjust buoyancy in some aquatic snakes and its function remains unknown in terrestrial species. Many organs that are paired, such as kidneys or reproductive organs, are staggered within the body, with one located ahead of the other.|$|E
