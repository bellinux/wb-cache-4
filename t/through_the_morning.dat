5|$|Intermittent {{bursts of}} deep {{convection}} kept satellite intensity estimates at 40mph (65km/h) <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of June28. After becoming {{embedded within a}} low-level westerly flow, the system began to slowly execute a small counter-clockwise loop. That afternoon, Celia degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system; operationally, the system was monitored as a tropical depression for an additional six hours before the final advisory from the NHC was issued. The remnants of Celia continued to drift towards the north before finally dissipating on June30, about 990mi (1,590km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|<b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> Hurricane Gustav {{continued}} to rapidly strengthen. Deep convection around the eye flared intensely and the hurricane's minimum central pressure dropped precipitously—24mbar (0.71inHg) in 24hours. By 1000UTC it had reached Category3 strength and {{continued to}} strengthen. Another drop in pressure–down 11mbar (0.32inHg) in 6hours to 954mbar (28.17inHg)–was quickly followed {{by an increase in}} wind speed to , making Hurricane Gustav a Category4 hurricane when it had been a mere tropical storm only 24 hours earlier. That afternoon, as Hurricane Gustav continued moving northwest towards Cuba, its western eyewall passed directly over the Isle of Youth.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking {{the area between}} New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east {{in response to the}} trough. Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.|$|E

5|$|Facing Hampshire in Southampton for {{the third}} match, Somerset won the toss and opted to bat first. The pitch was soft, due to the heavy {{rainfall}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and play started shortly after midday. Sainsbury was yet again one of few Somerset players to reach double figures, and they were bowled out for 101. Cecil Currie, a spin bowler for Hampshire, collected eight of the wickets. Somerset managed to restrict Hampshire's lead to 46 runs; Francis Reed took four wickets, and Fothergill three. Fowler and Fothergill were Somerset's most successful batsmen in their second innings, played mostly in light rain, helping the county to reach 118 runs. That left Hampshire requiring 73 runs to win, which the hosts achieved without losing any wickets, to beat Somerset with ten wickets to spare.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Fifth Army's advance up the Liri valley, the Māori Battalion's {{next major}} {{engagement}} came in early 1944 when they {{took part in the}} fighting around Monte Cassino. The position at Cassino was dominated by an historic Benedictine monastery. Throughout January the Allies continued their advance, but as they were checked by the German positions at Cassino the advance stalled. On the night of 17/18 February 1944, as part of an attempt to establish a bridgehead into the German lines, the Māoris were tasked with attacking the railway station in Cassino. They met very stiff resistance, and although they managed to reach the railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders. Lacking armoured support, which had failed to arrive, they fought <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and into the afternoon, but when their position was assaulted by two German tanks they were forced to withdraw. The two assaulting companies, 'A' and 'B', suffered over 60 per cent casualties, losing 128 men killed or wounded. In March they were again involved in fighting around Cassino, however, it was not until May that the position was eventually captured, by which time the New Zealanders had been withdrawn from the line, and transferred back to the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies {{to hold the line}} with a handful of replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E

5|$|<b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 8 January, weak {{wind shear}} {{hindered}} {{development of the}} system. After enough convection wrapped around the centre of circulation, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Narelle, the second named storm in the western region during the 2012–13 season. Shortly thereafter, intensification quickened as a central dense overcast formed and prominent banding features consolidated. Following {{the development of an}} eye early on 9 January, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Narelle to a severe tropical cyclone, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Over the following day, Narelle's intensity levelled out as it encountered moderate wind shear. Once the shear relaxed, the system resumed strengthening. With conditions more favourable, Narelle redeveloped an eye and its outflow improved. Late on 11 January, Narelle is estimated to have attained its peak intensity with winds of 195km/h (120mph) and a barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Operationally, the storm was believed to have been slightly stronger, peaking as a Category5 cyclone on the Australian scale. It was not until a post-storm assessment that the Bureau of Meteorology found Narelle to have been a weaker system at its peak. At the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 215km/h (130mph), ranking it as a Category4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|Tornado watches {{were issued}} for the Atlantic coast from Pennsylvania to Florida {{at the start}} of the day and {{continued}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and early afternoon, but tornadoes were forecasted to generally be weaker and more isolated. Despite this, the secondary portion of the outbreak that had begun producing scattered tornadoes throughout the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast regions the previous evening intensified during the early hours of the morning, producing numerous tornadoes in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland. While most were weak, some of the tornadoes that struck portions of Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania were strong. Although tornado watches were issued, no tornadoes were spotted in New Jersey or Washington, D.C. In the wake of the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, widespread flooding hit the Midwest, South, and Eastern Seaboard, with extensive flood and flash flood warnings issued. One particularly damaging and deadly EF3 tornado struck the town of Glade Spring, Virginia very early in the morning, where three people died. The last tornadoes of the outbreak touched down that afternoon in eastern North Carolina, which was hard hit in the April 16 outbreak, though the tornadoes that impacted the area this time around were weak. The system moved out into the Atlantic Ocean that evening, with the exception of isolated thunderstorms over central Florida that night into April 29, although there were no tornadoes then.|$|E
