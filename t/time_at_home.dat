5|$|Ng, {{who is a}} stay at home mother, {{writes in}} her spare <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Her topics are {{different}} depending on the genre she is writing in; her adult-oriented works often deal with minority groups, while her children's books are meant to teach empathy. Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group. However, some educators have protested {{the lack of an}} explicit moral message in her children's books.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa a hard <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> particularly since Homer {{is ready to}} host a barbecue, complete with roast pig. On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, Bolton {{had their first}} trip, and their first game against top-flight opposition, facing Liverpool at Anfield on 3 December.

Youri Djorkaeff would have put Bolton back into the lead, but referee Mike Riley disallowed it for an earlier handball; they scored minutes later from Jay-Jay Okocha's free kick. Liverpool got a second equaliser from a 25-yard Vladimír Šmicer strike, but with a minute remaining Salif Diao fouled Kevin Davies in the penalty area and Djorkaeff sent the resulting spot-kick past Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek to win the game. Thirteen days later, in extra <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> to the Premier League's Southampton, Pedersen volleyed the only goal with five minutes remaining.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce {{showed little}} {{interest}} in women, {{but when he was}} in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington recommended twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed {{little interest in}} his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807).

25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some {{people are more likely to}} answer the door (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E

25|$|Zoë Wanamaker (2000–11) portrays Susan Harper. Susan Harper is {{a control}} freak and very good at getting her way.

Susan is a tour guide but seems to spend most of her <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> She is a terrible cook. This is a homage to Butterflies, in which the male lead is also a dentist called Ben and the rest of the family often have to sneak the food she has prepared into the bin without her noticing.|$|E

Wendell Phillips gave a eulogy and many of Garrison's old abolitionist friends joined him upstairs to offer their private condolences.|$|E
25|$|When Atta was ten, {{his family}} moved to the Cairo {{neighborhood}} of Abdeen, located {{near the center of the}} city.

In 1990, Atta graduated with a degree in architecture and joined the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Engineers Syndicate organization. He then worked for several months at the Urban Development Center in Cairo, where he undertook tasks on architectural, planning, and building design. In 1990, Atta's family moved into an 11th floor apartment in Giza.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's {{trial began}} in late March. With a {{predominantly}} Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance {{to remove the}} President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off {{once in a while}} to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. When it came time to vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote supermajority needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the Republican National Convention. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the ten other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.|$|E
