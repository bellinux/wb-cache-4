5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted {{the principles of the}} Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Nesbitt had {{the lead}} role as the father {{character}} Tony Hughes in harrowing BBC drama series The Missing, alongside Frances O'Connor (as his wife/ex-wife, Emily Hughes/Walsh) and Tchéky Karyo (as Julien Baptiste, leading French police investigator). The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to their son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film The Way (2010).|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) {{discussing}} the Covenant ship above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens and proceeds to find clues as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to his squadmates.|$|E
5|$|The {{passage of}} the Mayflower across the North Atlantic lasted more than two months, with 102 {{passengers}} crowded onto the cargo ship's gun deck and about 30 crew members. The seas were not severe during {{the first month of}} the voyage but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were two deaths, but this was just a precursor <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> after their Cape Cod arrival, when almost half the company died in the first winter.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud's International Wanderers team, {{released}} his autobiography Chappelli {{and was named}} as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was hired to spend the summer of 1976–77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition where he was paid {{more than he had}} been as Australian captain. During the season, he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, Ian Botham. Both men have put forward vastly different versions as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub. The animosity between them continues and Channel Nine used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998–99 season. Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident.|$|E

5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen more than a year before, was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> next. Earp later testified that {{when he arrived at the}} Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E

25|$|The early {{flight of}} Soviet {{officials}} {{who were supposed}} to manage the evacuation was roundly condemned by Soviet leaders, but often their retreat resulted from a realisation that evacuation procedures had started too late, {{and that there was no}} way to effectively execute it.

Avoiding that, the officials knew that they would be subject to intense interrogation as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> by suspicious Soviets upon returning to the fold.|$|E

50|$|Brown’s {{research}} group has provided detailed insights into how anesthetics produce unconsciousness. The brain is not shut off under general anesthesia. Instead, anesthetics induce highly structured oscillations between key brain regions. These oscillations, which are readily visible in standard electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, alter arousal by impairing normal communication between regions. This is analogous <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when an epilepsy patient loses consciousness {{with the appearance}} of the regular, hypersynchronous oscillations of a seizure. Anesthetic-induced oscillations are also akin <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when a hum in a phone line makes it impossible to sustain a normal conversation.|$|R
