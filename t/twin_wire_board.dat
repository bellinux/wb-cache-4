40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>wire</b> {{submerged}} {{arc welding}} (SAW) is widely used in the joining of oil or gas pipe lines because of its high productivity. However, when it is applied to join the high strength steel pipe, the heat affected zone (HAZ), especially the coarse grain zone, becomes very brittle. To investigate the strength and toughness of HAZ, thermal cycles in HAZ due to <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> SAW must be studied. In present studies, theoretical equations of <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding thermal cycles for thick plate, thin plate are developed by authors and the critical thicknesses for both thick plate and thin plate are determined. The welding thermal cycles for intermediate thickness are predicted by linear interpolation using results of both thick plate and thin plate. Through the theoretical equations, thermal cycles of <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> SAW with actual welding conditions used in pipe line fabrication were predicted and verified by both FEM and experiment. Good agreement among theoretical results, FEM and experimental results was achieved. Furthermore, the microstructures and Vicker’s hardness of HAZ was predicted based on CCT diagram and thermal cycles calculated by the proposed theoretical equations. Predicted microstructures and hardness were compared with the experimental ones. A good agreement was also obtained...|$|R

25|$|When {{the board}} has no {{embedded}} components it is more correctly called a printed <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> (PWB) or etched <b>wiring</b> <b>board.</b> However, the term printed <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is backplane assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|R

40|$|The paper treats a weld {{discontinuity}} called lack of fusion, {{which is}} frequently {{a cause of}} leakage of a water heater. The heater was produced by MAG welding using two <b>wires</b> (<b>twin</b> arc welding). The paper states some reasons for the occurrence of lack of fusion, i. e. the arc blow effect, an inappropriate gun position, uncontrolled movement of the weld pool, too low energy input, an improper joint preparation. The defect is illustrated in a macrograph of a weld produced at the water heater with <b>twin</b> <b>wires</b> in a shielding gas. Welding with <b>twin</b> <b>wires</b> is schematically represented with a circumferential welded joint between the end and shell of the water heater...|$|R

Here we propose a <b>wire</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing method {{that could be used in}} any laboratory forrapid prototyping of electronic devices. This method allows us to create <b>wire</b> <b>boards</b> for surface mountingtechnology, with space between pins down to 0. 5 mm.

Thus, the traditionally used synthetic resin systems, e. g., phenolic or epoxy resins, are substituted. Beyond the quality profile of printed <b>wiring</b> <b>boards</b> basing on phenolic resins, the production of double sided through hole plated PWB should be realized.

The <b>twin</b> <b>wires</b> method is widely used to measure longitudinal and transverse impedance on the bench. A mode error is induced when the <b>twin</b> <b>wires</b> method is used with a two-port network analyzer. Here, the mode error is analyzed theoretically and an example analysis is given. Moreover, the mode error in the measurement is a few percent when a hybrid with no less than 25 dB isolation and a splitter with no less than 20 dB magnitude error are used...|$|R

40|$|Research in the {{development}} of additive manufacturing process employing direct metal deposition for the fabrication of fully functional parts and tooling has generated significant interest in the recent years. Three-dimensional welding is being investigated as an additive manufacturing technique for the production of real metallic parts using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) principles. The temperature field distribution during weld based rapid prototyping induces complex thermal stress evolutions and plays a big role in residual stress distributions. The present work is to investigate the temperature field and thermal stress distributions in the multi-pass single-layer weld-deposition based additive manufacturing using <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding. A three-dimensional finite element model with the temperature-dependent material properties and moving heat source is modelled for the same. A double ellipsoidal heat source model is applied to calculate the <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding‟s temperature field is used. The filler metal deposition is taken into account by implementing the birth-and-death functionality for the finite elements. The temperature distribution pattern and magnitude is subsequently obtained. This result is then used for estimation of residual stress and distortion due to the <b>twin</b> <b>wire</b> welding...|$|R
