40|$|The {{literature}} {{concerning the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the inter-industry wage premium has not addressed {{the role of}} total factor productivity (TFP) in determining both the wage premium and tariffs. This omission invalidates the use <b>of</b> the pre-reform <b>tariff</b> level as an instrument for the change in tariffs. Based on an analysis of Colombian data, I find that including TFP in the estimated model of the effects <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the wage premium leads to a 36 % decrease in the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the inter-industry wage premium relative to the model that omits TFP. More specifically, a ten percentage point decrease in tariffs reduces the wage premium by 1. 1 %. This finding suggests the importance of using policies that boost productivity to offset the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the wage premium. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> for labour productivity faces the challenge <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> policy endogeneity. Tariff policy is designed to promote economic development and the industrial sector tariff structure may reflect characteristics of the industries protected. We seek to identify the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> by taking advantage <b>of</b> multilateral <b>tariff</b> liberalization using reductions in industrial sector tariffs in other world regions as instruments for sectoral tariff reductions in South Africa. The data cover 28 manufacturing sectors over the period 1988 - 2003. We find that tariff reductions have stimulated labour productivity when instrumented by multilateral tariffs. The ordinary least-squares estimates show downward bias and this confirms the endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Investigation <b>of</b> channels of effects shows some support {{for the importance of}} competitive pressure and technology spillover from trade liberalization.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} multilateral market access liberalization of the Doha Round agricultural negotiations. At the center are the effects of variations in the magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> cuts, different tariff cutting formulas, the tariff capping as well as different numbers and width <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> bands. The simulations are conducted with an extended version of the GTAP model and the GTAP database (6. 0) including bound and applied rates and a module to cut tariffs at the 6 -digit tariff line level. The results reveal that the heights <b>of</b> the <b>tariff</b> cuts {{and the kind of}} tiered formula applied are most important for the outcome of the Doha Round, while the width <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> bands and the tariff capping only have a moderate influence on the countries' trade pattern and welfare. In contrast, the number <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> bands is not important for the results. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector, {{which is}} Korea's most sensitive sector, {{is supposed to}} resume its negotiation {{by the end of}} 1999 according to WTO's Agreement on Agriculture. As Korea needs to propose in the negotiation <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction a device by which exceptional measures on sensitive sectors can be allowed, it is important to establish some application method <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> cut in advance. As no specific form <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction has yet been established, this study tries to apply to agriculture different tariff cut methods proposed in the course of GATT/WTO negotiation and to analyze the merits and shortcomings of each form <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction. In this way, it will lay a strong foundation for designing a negotiation scheme that will give Korea a favorable position in future tariff negotiation. The results of study show that UR method is considered as the most favorable method for Korea. It is desirable for Korea to actively take initiatives in next negotiation by developing and proposing its own tariff reduction scheme that would probably result in the adoption of a form <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> cut favorable to Korea...|$|R
