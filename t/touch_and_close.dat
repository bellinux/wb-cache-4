50|$|Infrared light {{makes up}} the {{invisible}} section of the electromagnetic spectrum. This light, also classified as heat, transmits signals between the transmitter and receiver of the remote system. Telecommand systems usually include a physical remote, which contains four key parts: buttons, integrated circuit, button contacts, and a light-emitting diode. When the buttons on a remote are pressed they <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>close</b> their corresponding contacts below them within the remote. This completes the necessary circuit on the circuit board along with a change in electrical resistance, which is detected by the integrated circuit. Based on the change in electrical resistance, the integrated circuit distinguishes which button was pushed and sends a corresponding binary code to the light-emitting diode (LED) usually located {{at the front of}} the remote. To transfer the information from the remote to the receiver, the LED turns the electrical signals into an invisible beam of infrared light that corresponds with the binary code and sends this light to the receiver. The receiver then detects the light signal via a photodiode and it is transformed into an electrical signal for the command and is sent to the receiver’s integrated circuit/microprocessor to process and complete the command. The strength of the transmitting LED can vary and determines the required positioning accuracy of the remote in relevance to the receiver. Infrared remotes have a maximum range of approximately 30 feet and require the remote control or transmitter and receiver to be within a line of sight.|$|E

40|$|Among {{theories}} {{that address the}} impact of variations in immediacy behaviors during ongoing interactions are nonverbal expectancy violations and discrepancy arousal theories. This study {{of the effects of}} violations of expectations on arousal and reciprocity and compensation in the medical student-patient relationship proposed that (1) nonverbal expectancy violations theory would be more valid than discrepancy arousal theory in predicting outcomes, (2) violations of expectations would be followed by an orientation response as indicated by both physiological indicators and nonverbal behaviors, and (3) physiological indicators of arousal intensity would be associated with nonverbal indicators of arousal intensity. The results indicate that neither nonverbal expectancy violations nor discrepancy arousal theory's predictions were entirely valid, as high and very high involvement (including <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>close</b> proximity) were met with reciprocity of high involvement, while low and very low involvement (negative violations of expectations) were met with reciprocity of low involvement. Additionally, all violations of expectations were followed by increases in arousal rather than the orientation response. Finally, arousal was generally predictive of nonverbal indicators of arousal intensity, thus offering less obtrusive ways to measure arousal...|$|E

All the standard elements of OCR process like deskewing, preprocessing, segmentation, character recognition and reconstruction are implemented. Experience with OCR problems teaches that for most subtasks involved in OCR, there is no single technique that gives perfect results for every type of document image. We have used the ability of artificial neural networks to learn arbitrary input/output mappings from sample data for solving the key problems of segmentation and character recognition. Text segmentation of Tamil newsprint poses a new challenge owing to its italic-like font type; problems that arise in recognition of <b>touching</b> <b>and</b> <b>close</b> characters are discussed. Character recognition efficiency varied from 94 to 97 % for this particular type of font. The grouping of blocks into logical units and the determination of read order within each logical unit helped us in reconstructing automatically the document image in editable format.

40|$|Background and aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the light <b>touch,</b> vision <b>and</b> dual task interference on the surface electromyography (sEMG) activity of ankle muscles Participants: Thirty persons (12 male, 18 Female), right hand without any neuro-musculo-skeletal disorder and in healthy condition, participated in this study.   Methods and Materials: Participants stood in upright and semi tandem position. There was a high sensitivity sensor on the right side in direction of femur greater trochanter. They should press the sensor less than 50 gr. Also we examined the rate of activity in 3 muscles (Tibialis Anterior, Proneus Longuse, Soleuse) on both lower limbs by Biometrix sEMG device. 4 positions were experimented in semi tandem standing: No Touch, No Counting; No Touch, Counting; Light Touch, No Counting; Light Touch, Counting. Each of the above positions was tested in 2 conditions: Eyes Open, Eyes Closed.   Results: Our findings detect that light touch contact especially during vision, resulted in reducing the rate of sEMG activity in the leg postural muscles. No <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> eyes, raise the rate of sEMG activity to maximum. conclusion: On basis of findings, it seems that following skin receptors stimulation, some complicated mechanisms will be begun and in order to the orders of Central Nervous System (CNS), these muscles will make the hole body, stable. So it can reduce the entered pressure on leg postural muscles. Therefore we can see the lesser rate in sEMG activity of leg postural muscles...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{differences}} in physical contact and tactile interpersonal behaviours between Hispanic and Anglo mothers and infants living in the United States. Infants were 9 months old and 52 mother-infant dyads, 26 Hispanic and 26 Anglo, were videotaped during free play without toys in a university laboratory playroom.

From questionnaire data we found that Hispanic and Anglo mothers both touch their infants on a daily basis, although Hispanic mothers report touching more frequently, being more affectionate with their infants and having more skin-to-skin contact. From videotaped observations we found that there were no overall differences in mother-infant touch between the two cultures; however, the Hispanic mothers showed more <b>close</b> <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> more <b>close</b> <b>and</b> affectionate <b>touch</b> compared to Anglo mothers, who showed more distal touch.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{speculative}} role of the pedicellariae of the sea star Acanthaster planci in fouling control, as quantitative measurements showed that this species is free of any macro-fouling organisms. The morphology and distribution of its pedicellariae were measured to determine if larvae or propagules of fouling organisms could settle between pedicellariae without being in their physical range. The elementary and straight pedicellariae of A. planci had a mean length of 0. 7 mm and a mean distance of 2. 6 mm. The total number of pedicellariae was proportional to the estimated surface area of A. planci. To determine how pedicellariae respond to tactile stimulation, pedicellariae were stimulated by touching either inner, outer or basal sites of pedicellariae with a hypodermic needle. Pedicellariae <b>closed</b> rapidly on <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> for significantly longer when touched at their inner sites (8. 9 s) than outer (6. 7 s) and basal (7. 9 s) sites. Settling larvae were simulated by dropping silica beads (size: 50. 2, 181. 5, 255. 7 and 510. 7 µm, density: 2. 5 g ml- 1) and zirconium/silica beads (size: 191. 2 and 507. 6 µm, density: 3. 7 g ml- 1) over the pedicellariae. The percentage of responding pedicellariae increased proportionally with increasing size of the silica beads. However, the percentage also increased when zirconium/silica beads of similar size but higher density were used, demonstrating that the mass, not size, of the beads was the main driving factor for the closure of pedicellariae. Pedicellariae were also stimulated by placing larvae of the bryozoan Bugula neritina (250 µm) and fragments of the alga Chrysocystis fragilis (150 - 1000 µm) over the pedicellariae. However, {{the response of the}} pedicellariae to the larvae of B. neritina was consistently low and none of the pedicellariae responded to the fragments of C. fragilis. These results demonstrate that for A. planci pedicellariae offer little or no defence against fouling...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) has shown effectiveness in restoring upper-limb movement post-stroke {{when applied to}} assist participants’ voluntary intention during repeated, motivating tasks. Recent clinical trials have used advanced controllers that precisely adjust FES to assist functional reach and grasp tasks with FES applied to three muscle groups, showing significant reduction in impairment. The system reported in this paper advances the state-of-the-art by: (1) integrating an FES electrode array on the forearm to assist complex hand and wrist gestures; (2) utilising non-contact depth cameras to accurately record the arm, hand and wrist position in 3 D; and (3) employing an interactive touch table to present motivating virtual reality (VR) tasks. The system also uses iterative learning control (ILC), a model-based control strategy which adjusts the applied FES based on the tracking error recorded on previous task attempts. Feasibility of the system has been evaluated in experimental trials with 2 unimpaired participants and clinical trials with 4 hemiparetic, chronic stroke participants. The stroke participants attended 17, 1 hour training sessions in which they performed functional tasks, such as button pressing using the <b>touch</b> table <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> a drawer.

50|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} Teraterpeton {{is the large}} size of its narial fenestra, {{a hole in the}} skull that serves as the opening for the nostril. This hole is {{positioned}} {{directly in front of the}} eyes and extends to the level of the toothless portion of the snout. It is positioned where the antorbital fenestra would normally be. In fact, the namer of Teraterpeton first considered the hole to be an antorbital fenestra. The anterior margin of the antorbital fenestra is usually bound by the maxilla near the end of the snout and the lacrimal near the eye socket. However, the maxilla of Teraterpeton has moved closer to the eye socket, <b>touching</b> the lacrimal <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> off the antorbital fenestra. Comparable in size to the antorbital fenestrae of many other archosauromorphs, the narial fenestra of Teraterpeton is even longer than the eye socket.|$|R
40|$|Qualitative {{evidence}} suggests that sea stars have remarkably clean epidermal surfaces. To quantify surface-associated micro- and macroorganisms, field surveys were conducted in northern Queensland, Australia, during the wet and dry seasons. Mean bacterial abundances on 7 sea star species were approximately 104 to 105 cells cm- 2 during both seasons. There were no consistent trends in bacterial abundances with season, species and aboral positions on sea star arms. Low numbers of parasitic and commensal macroorganisms were found on 6 sea star species, and no common generalist macrofouling organisms, such as algae, barnacles, serpulid polychaetes, bryozoans and ascidians, were discovered on any specimens. Sea stars therefore offered an excellent model to investigate the mechanisms driving fouling-resistant surfaces. Subsequently, 5 sea star species belonging to the order Valvatida were chosen for this study to investigate mechanical, physical and chemical fouling deterrence: Acanthaster planci (Family Acanthasteridae), Linckia laevigata and Fromia indica (both Family Ophidiasteridae), Cryptasterina pentagona (Family Asterinidae) and Archaster typicus (Family Archasteridae). It has been proposed that mechanical antifouling defence mechanisms of sea stars are linked with pedicellariae, which are pincer-like appendages made of calcareous ossicles. In this study, the role of pedicellariae of the sea star A. planci in fouling control was investigated. The morphology and distribution of its pedicellariae were measured to determine if larvae or propagules of fouling organisms could settle between pedicellariae without being in their physical range. The elementary and straight pedicellariae of A. planci had a mean length of 0. 7 mm and a mean distance of 2. 6 mm. The total number of pedicellariae was proportional to the estimated surface area of A. planci. To determine how pedicellariae respond to tactile stimulation, pedicellariae were stimulated by touching either inner, outer or basal sites of pedicellariae with a hypodermic needle. Pedicellariae <b>closed</b> rapidly on <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> for significantly longer when touched at their inner sites (8. 9 s) than outer (6. 7 s) and basal (7. 9 s) sites. Settling larvae were simulated by dropping silica beads (size: 50. 2 μm, 181. 5 μm, 255. 7 μm and 510. 7 μm, density: 2. 5 g ml- 1) and zirconium/silica beads (size: 191. 2 μm and 507. 6 μm, density: 3. 7 g ml- 1) over the pedicellariae. The percentage of responding pedicellariae increased proportionally with increasing size of the silica beads. However, the percentage also increased when zirconium/silica beads of similar size but higher density were used, demonstrating that the mass, not size, of the beads was the main driving factor for the closure of pedicellariae.
