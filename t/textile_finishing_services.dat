The commercial work carried out at Shirley Towers is typical of the many fabric drying operations which use stenters throughout the country. In common with many <b>textile</b> <b>finishing</b> sites, the drying operation is a production bottleneck. The Shirley Towers management decided that the most cost-effective way to overcome this problem and increase production capacity was to improve mechanical dewatering, before stenter drying, by retrofitting a suction slot. The extra productivity resulting from this gave a payback period of three months. ...|$|R

In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the viability of reusing effluent water obtained from different <b>textile</b> <b>finishing</b> processes of cotton fabrics after just basic treatments. These treatments include; filtering, airing, pH regulating and ion exchange. Effluent water obtained in different <b>textile</b> <b>finishing</b> processes was analysed in terms of pH value, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), SS (Suspended Solids), colour, hardness and conductivity.

30|$|In view of {{the past}} {{reported}} studies, the most utilized material fabric is cotton. In some of the studies, the greigh fabric have been processed through the <b>textile</b> <b>finishing</b> processes for making a <b>finished</b> fabrics. <b>Textile</b> <b>finishing</b> usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process. <b>Textile</b> <b>finishing</b> usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process (Hall 1966). None reported the cotton fabric experiencing the finishing process mercerizing process. It is remarkable that the wet preparing of cotton fabrics prompts its shrinkage, expanding the yarn number, mass every unit territory, and fabric thickness (Tarbuk et al. 2014). Mercerised cotton fibre will be round and hollow rather than strip like shapes, and the cross-segments of the filaments change from kidney like to roundabout molded. The primary explanation behind this is the cotton fibre swelling amid the mercerisation process. Amid mercerization, Sodium Hyroxide (NaoH) infiltrated into the lumen of the cotton strands and swelled. Mercerizing process is the act of chemical treatment on cellulosic fibre to improve {{the properties of the}} fibre in term of tensile strength, absorption properties and also greater affinity of dyes and various chemical finishes. Mercerized cotton holds the properties of higher mass per unit area, thickness, breaking force and elongation, luster, with a change of surface charge that ensures further quality improvement and also higher adsorption of anionic auxiliaries.|$|R
