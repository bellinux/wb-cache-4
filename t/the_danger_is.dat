5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E

25|$|The {{route from}} Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) {{is one of}} the most {{frustrating}} in the Lake District. What seems like a direct route is in fact very hazardous as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and belay protection. Wainwright warns against its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> seen.|$|E

25|$|Since November 19, 2004, {{there have}} been over 2,800 {{incidents}} of lasers directed at aircraft within the United States. These concerns have led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and beam spread of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as flash blindness. If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant genetic trait, photic sneeze, that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light. Some observers believe that <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> greatly exaggerated, at least for small hand-held lasers.|$|E

500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E
500|$|Kenshin {{has been}} highly {{popular with the}} Rurouni Kenshin reader base, having ranked first in every Weekly Shōnen Jump {{popularity}} poll of the series, always with {{more than double the}} votes of the second place character. Two polls by the official Rurouni Kenshin anime featured Kenshin as one of the series' most popular characters. In the first, Kenshin was at the top, while in the second, he placed second. His Battōsai incarnation was also fifth in the latter poll. Kenshin has also been featured various times in the Animages Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking {{as one of the most}} popular male anime characters. In a Newtype poll in March 2010, Kenshin was voted the eighth most popular male anime character from the 1990s. An abundance of merchandise have been released in Kenshin's likeness including keychains, action figures, and plush dolls. Since the manga was published, non-functional and functional sakabatō have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans. In a poll by Anime News Network, Kenshin was voted as the second best male anime character with long hair, being surpassed by Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist. In 2014, IGN ranked him as the fifth greatest anime character of all time, saying that: [...] "Although Kenshin's momentary lapses make him a complete badass and set the stage for some of the most epic sword battles ever animated, Kenshin always goes back to his sweet persona once <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> gone." [...] Kenshin was also fifth in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie describing him as: [...] "A classic example of a classic anime type, the peace-loving killing machine." [...] Kenshin's Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki technique has ranked third in a Japanese survey that featured the most popular moves in manga and anime. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the top [...] "guy". In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Kenshin was voted as the 16th [...] "strongest hero" [...] from the Showa Era as well as the 15th one from the Heisei Era.|$|E
