5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
25|$|It was his baptism of fire, and I {{have since}} {{wondered}} at the strange caprice which strikes down {{one man in}} his first skirmish and protects another time after time. But I suppose all pitchers will get broken in the end. Outwardly I sympathised with my brother in his misfortune, which he mourned bitterly, since it prevented him {{taking part in the}} impending battle, but secretly I confess myself well content <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> gentleman should be honourably out of harm's way for a month.|$|E
25|$|The {{house at}} Avenida 3 Ote 201 {{in the city}} of Puebla belonged to Pedro de Carvajal, who was a wealthy and {{respected}} man. However, he lost his young wife as she gave birth to their second child, a boy. When his daughter turned 15, there were many interested suitors but she was not interested in them. One day a monster appeared at a party in the city provoking terror. The monster went to the Carvajal house and ate the younger son, who was playing out front of the house. Pedro offered a large reward for the capture of the beast. One young man, who wanted the hand of Pedro’s daughter, appeared at another festival, bearing the head of the beast. It is said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> man gained noble title and the hand of the daughter as a reward.|$|E

500|$|Songs, such as [...] "Tus Desprecios", about {{dysfunctional}} {{and volatile}} relationships has a storyline typical of mariachi recordings. It used a conjunto (small band) style, where Tejano music originated, and included a [...] "trilling" [...] accordion {{which serves as}} its signature base. Perone wrote that the song [...] "exhibit the ease" [...] of Selena's transition from [...] "middle-of-the-road pop ballad to Latin dance music to [...] style." [...] Another track, [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] uses the identical style of ranchera songs, with the female singer agonizing over {{the end of a}} relationship. Its lyrics explore unrequited love; where a woman wishes the best for her former lover despite her own agony. Her [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "emotive" [...] overdubbed vocals were found to be [...] "low [...] sober", sung in a [...] "desperate" [...] and [...] "sentimental" [...] way. According to Hispanic magazine, her vocals in the song [...] "proves <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> vocalist has the interpretive tools of established singers twice her age." ...|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> man could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
500|$|The inquest {{was opened}} by Leonard Gorodkin at Manchester Coroner's Court on 8 January 1993. Dr William Lawler, a Home Office pathologist, testified that Capper had {{suffered}} 75—80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown {{over her and}} set alight, and that her chance of survival had been minimal. [...] "It {{was clear from the}} outset that Suzanne was unlikely to survive. She suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally." [...] Death was due to complications caused by these burns. The coroner said: [...] "It is clear <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival. But she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to the people mentioned being charged with her death." [...] To Capper's mother and stepfather the coroner said: [...] "I offer you, not just on my behalf but on behalf of the whole nation, my very deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to your young daughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bryan Roth, a {{psychiatrist}} and pharmacologist at the University of North Carolina who has led the research into how salvia's active constituent salvinorin A works, says it's difficult to say what role the drug might have played in Brett Chidester's suicide. Although [...] "it's tragic <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> guy killed himself," [...] he says, [...] "there's {{no way of knowing}} if salvia {{had anything to do with}} it. It would seem, given the apparent widespread use of salvia, that if these are side effects, they don't occur at very high prevalence. Otherwise, the ERs would be filled with people having bad salvia reactions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Working {{in their}} favor were Feldman's eloquent {{speaking}} talents, Torah knowledge, and secular education. The fact <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> Jewish couple [...] he an expert tennis player and she a well-dressed, former fashion designer [...] still observed what people thought of as outdated mitzvot intrigued and attracted new congregants. Still, change was gradual. It {{was only in the}} 1960s that a small group of congregants bought houses near the synagogue so they could walk to it on Shabbat and Yom Tov, and began sending their children to the Hebrew Academy of Atlanta, a day school which Feldman helped establish in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is usually}} one {{dominant}} mature stallion for every mixed-sex herd of horses. The dominant stallion in the herd will tolerate both sexes of horses while young, {{but once they}} become sexually mature, often as yearlings or two-year-olds, the stallion will drive both colts and fillies from the herd. [...] Colts may present competition for the stallion, but studies suggest that driving off young horses of both sexes may also be an instinctive behavior that minimizes the risk of inbreeding within the herd, as most young are the offspring of the dominant stallion in the group. [...] In some cases, a single younger mature male may be tolerated {{on the fringes of}} the herd. [...] One theory is <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> male is considered a potential successor, as in time the younger stallion will eventually drive out the older herd stallion.|$|E

2500|$|Following a brief tour in Europe, Hodges {{arranged}} {{an engagement}} for Double Trouble as The Moody Blues' opening act during a two-month tour of North America. Hodges stated {{that many people}} disliked the idea of Double Trouble opening for The Moody Blues, but asserted that a common thread that both bands shared was [...] "album-oriented rock". Shannon described the tour as [...] "glorious": [...] "Our record hadn't become that successful yet, but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people. We just went out and played, and it fit like a glove. The sound rang through those big coliseums like a monster. People were going crazy, {{and they had no}} idea who we were!" [...] After appearing on the television series Austin City Limits, the band played a sold-out concert at New York City's Beacon Theatre. Variety wrote that their ninety-minute set at the Beacon [...] "left no doubt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> Texas musician is indeed the 'guitar hero of the present era.'" ...|$|E
