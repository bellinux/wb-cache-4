25|$|A human-powered {{aircraft}} (HPA) is {{an aircraft}} powered by direct human {{energy and the}} force of gravity. The thrust provided by the human {{may be the only}} source.

500|$|As {{early as}} 1999, a {{sizeable}} minority of FUNCINPEC's politicians were unhappy with Ranariddh's leadership, as rumours [...] began to circulate {{that he had}} accepted bribes from the CPP. In February 2002, FUNCINPEC performed poorly in the commune elections, winning 10 out of 1,600 commune seats. As a result of FUNCINPEC's poor performance in the commune elections, rifts within the party boiled into the open. In March 2002, the Deputy Commander-in-chief of the RCAF – Khan Savoeun, accused You Hockry, the co-Minister of the Interior, of corruption and nepotism, acts which Savoeun claimed had alienated voters. When Ranariddh expressed support for Savoeun [...] in May 2002, Hockry resigned. Around the same time, two new political parties, splintered from FUNCINPEC, were formed: [...] the Khmer Soul Party, led by Norodom Chakrapong, and <b>the</b> <b>Hang</b> Dara Democratic Party, led by Hang Dara. Both new parties attracted sizeable numbers of FUNCINPEC defectors, who were apparently unhappy with Ranariddh's leadership. The defections caused Ranariddh to fear that FUNCINPEC would fare poorly in the 2003 general elections.|$|E

Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, [...] "Jael Cracken" [...] and [...] "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included Keith Roberts' first two stories: [...] "Escapism", a time travel tale, and [...] "Anita", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as [...] "Alistair Bevan", and also provided the artwork for several covers. The Day of the Minotaur, another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title The Blue Monkeys. Swann's novel The Weirwoods was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers that began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe Science Fantasy under Bonfiglioli's editorship as [...] "a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own".|$|E
