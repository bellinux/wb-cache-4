5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E

5|$|To be {{eligible}} for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health, provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English. Migrants working in some occupations (mainly health) must be registered with the appropriate profession body before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> within that area. Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa. Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit {{for two years and}} are then eligible to apply for residency. Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work where there has been a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some argue {{psychotherapy}} is under-utilized and under-researched by contemporary psychiatry despite offering more promise than stagnant medication development. In 2015 the US National Institute of Mental Health is allocating only 5.4% {{of its budget}} to new clinical trials of psychotherapies (medication trials are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies), despite plentiful evidence <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> and that patients {{are more likely to}} prefer them.|$|E
25|$|Most {{companies}} in Europe and the US {{do not use}} petroleum-powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts.

Fuel cell-powered forklifts {{can be used in}} refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The FC units are often designed as drop-in replacements.|$|E

In 2002, the Asian Development Bank approved an assistance package to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) which trains young Tuvaluans so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> aboard foreign vessels. This project was completed in 2011. The Global Economic Crisis (GEC) that began in 2007 has impacted on global export-import activities and the demand for shipping, which reduced the need for seafarers from Tuvalu.|$|E

500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] â€“ {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|E
500|$|A University of Houston professor, Peter Nguyen, remarked in 2005, [...] "You almost get a {{different}} sense of feeling once you cross over to Bellaire." [...] Bellaire is an incorporated city consisting of single-family houses and a reputation for safety. Nguyen said that he believed the city should increase efforts to reduce crime in Gulfton. He added {{that it would be}} difficult to engage Gulfton's population of [...] "working people", living [...] "day to day", to participate in anti-crime activities like crime watches. Bruce Williams, a Houston Police Department Captain, states that it is difficult to fight crime with the reductions in manpower. Williams said that U.S. federal government agents began working with the Houston Police Department to arrest serious gang criminals in Gulfton, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) members who were operating in the neighborhood. In 2007, Tammy Rodriguez, head of the Gulfton Super Neighborhood department for the City of Houston, and the Fondren Patrol Division announced that the division would expand its Police Apartments Clergy Team (PACT) into three Gulfton complexes. PACT places married couples who are active in churches into the apartment complexes so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> with tenants. The PACT program initially focused on the Napoleon Square and Chateaux Carmel complexes. In August 2009 a gang war erupted between the Southwest Cholos and other area gangs causing violence to increase in Gulfton and surrounding areas.|$|E
