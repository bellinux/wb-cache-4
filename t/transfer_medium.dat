25|$|There {{are three}} primary classifications of heat {{exchangers}} {{according to their}} flow arrangement. In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in {{parallel to one another}} to the other side. In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can transfer the most heat from the heat (<b>transfer)</b> <b>medium</b> per unit mass {{due to the fact that}} the average temperature difference along any unit length is higher. See countercurrent exchange. In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger.|$|E

Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A better {{understanding}} of the non-targeted (bystander) effects of radiation may have important implications with regards to radiation risk assessment, radiation protection, and targeted cancer therapy. In the present study, the direct and bystander effects of α-particle irradiation in immortalized human fibroblasts (F 11 hTERT) and breast cancer cells (MCF- 7) was investigated. To ensure a more accurate dose delivery to these different cell lines, an existing 238 Pu α-particle irradiator was improved by the addition of a collimator and the development of an analytical equation for calculation of the radiation dose to cells. The mean dose rate and α-particle fluence were calculated for each cell line by taking into consideration the size of their nuclei. Bystander effect experiments were performed by <b>transferring</b> <b>medium</b> from irradiated to unirradiated cells and by measuring micronucleu...|$|R

Bystander effects are indirect consequences of radiation and many other stress factors. They occur in cells that are not directly exposed to these factors, but receive signals from affected cells either by gap junctions or by molecules released in the medium. Characterizing these effects and deciphering the underlying mechanisms involved in radiation-induced bystander effects are relevant for cancer radiotherapy and radioprotection. At doses of X-ray radiation 0. 5 and 1 Gy, we detected bystander effects as increased numbers of micronuclei shortly after the treatment, through <b>medium</b> <b>transfer</b> and by co-cultures. Interestingly, bystander cells did not exhibit long-term adverse changes in viability. Evaluation of several compartmental stress markers (CHOP, BiP, mtHsp 60, cytHsp 70) by qRT-PCR did not reveal expression changes at transcriptional level. We investigated the involvement of ROS and NO in this process by addition of specific scavengers of these molecules, DMSO or c-PTIO in the <b>transferred</b> <b>medium.</b> This approach proved that ROS but not NO {{is involved in the}} induction of lesions in the acceptor cells. These results indicate that L 929 cells are susceptible to stress effects of radiation-induced bystander signaling...|$|R
