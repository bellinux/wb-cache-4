30|$|The bMCU {{test can}} be easily {{implemented}} in the physics classroom. <b>Test</b> <b>instructions</b> are short and readily understandable by secondary school students. The test can be processed in approximately 20  min and analyzed in 1  min per test by simply checking answer alternatives and summing all of the items solved without mistakes (all of the correct answer alternatives and no wrong answer alternative marked). The distribution of the item parameters that represents each item’s difficulty enables a differentiated measurement of secondary school students’ abilities in the average achievement range with most items covering this area. Simultaneously, there are two easily solvable, encouraging items and two particularly difficult items that allow assessment at the top end and prevent ceiling effects. We ascertained that the instrument assesses the same underlying ability for girls and boys and for different age and intelligence groups. The test seems to measure conceptual understanding of Newton’s mechanics unambiguously, independent of both the quality of physics instruction and whether the test has been taken only once or repeatedly. Consequently, whenever fair and efficient assessment of understanding of Newton’s mechanics is required, the bMCU test may be considered. The test could not only complement summative assessments but also be highly valuable {{in the context of}} formative assessment (e.g., Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, 2005; Wiliam, 2010), in which efficiency is especially important.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} component and system performance testing associated with the Vitrification Facility (VF) following construction turnover. The VF at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) was designed to convert stored radioactive waste into a stable glass form for eventual disposal in a federal repository. Following an initial Functional and Checkout Testing of Systems (FACTS) Program and subsequent conversion of test stand equipment into the final VF, a testing program was executed to demonstrate successful performance of the components, subsystems, and systems {{that make up the}} vitrification process. Systems were started up and brought on line as construction was completed, until integrated system operation could be demonstrated to produce borosilicate glass using nonradioactive waste simulant. Integrated system testing and operation culminated with a successful Operational Readiness Review (ORR) and Department of Energy (DOE) approval to initiate vitrification of high-level waste (HLW) on June 19, 1996. Performance and integrated operational test runs conducted during the test program provided a means for critical examination, observation, and evaluation of the vitrification system. Test data taken for each <b>Test</b> <b>Instruction</b> Procedure (TIP) was used to evaluate component performance against system design and acceptance criteria, while test observations were used to correct, modify, or improve system operation.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{two aspects}} of intuition: preference and process. The underlying basis of preference for intuition defined by Jung in his theory of psychological types and measured by the sensing-intuition (SN) scale of the Myers- Briggs Type Indicator was explored in two areas: performance on ability tests and individual differences in use of intuition. Process of intuition {{is defined as the}} use of unconscious associations to guide decision making. A thinking aloud protocol technique was used to investigate differences in strategy between sensing and intuitive types on two ability tests. <b>Test</b> <b>instructions</b> and conditions were varied to investigate whether preference or ability underlies this difference. Results indicated that the SN difference is best characterised as a focus on different types of information - concrete reality vs. looking beyond reality to patterns, connections and possibilities. The finding that sensing types could modify their style suggested that this is due to a personality preference that can be overridden rather than an underlying ability difference. The nature of the SN difference was further explored by examining the differences predicted by type theory between the types in the use of intuition. This prediction contrasts with some process theories of intuition which expect few or no individual differences. Results indicated that intuitive types were more accurate and more likely to choose to use intuition than sensing types. Results suggested that preference for different types of information led to use of different strategies on the tasks. Intuitive types tended to focus on feelings of familiarity, which resulted in their accessing intuition in the form of unconsciously learnt associations. Sensing types preferred to focus on concrete information such as conscious memory of prior experience. The research has made contributions by evaluating the theory of psychological types, validating the sensing-intuition scale, and also by demonstrating the existence of individual differences in certain measures of intuition...|$|R

The experimental group was made up of 138 students who had received first grade instruction using the Early-to-Read i/t/a series during the two academic years 1968 - 69 and 1969 - 70. They had continued in the La Crosse Public Schools and had taken the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (I. T. B. S.) at the beginning of third grade. The same number of students who received beginning reading instruction in the Ginn Series were selected for a control group. The two groups were matched by means of: 1) Ginn Pre-Reading Test given at the beginning of first grade, 2) sex and 3) socio-economic factors. In comparing the achievement of the two groups, four measures of achievement were used: I. T. B. S. Reading, Spelling, Vocabulary, and Arithmetic scores. The scores of the two groups were classified according to three ability levels; high, medium, and low; by using the Ginn Pre-Reading Test results. An analysis of variance on the four measures of achievement was conducted. In addition, an analysis of variance was done using the means of the i. t. a. and T. O. groups on the Lorge-Thorndike I. Q. Test which was given concurrently with the I. T. B. S. Correlations were also obtained between Reading and I. Q., Reading and Pre-Reading level, Pre-Reading level and I. Q., and Vocabulary and I. Q. No significant differences were found between the groups on the I. T. B. S. Reading, Spelling, or Arithmetic, however, the i. t. a. group was significantly higher on the I. Q. test and the I. T. B. S. Vocabulary test. Regardless of method, girls performed at a significantly higher level on the I. Q. test and the I. T. B. S. Reading and Spelling tests.
