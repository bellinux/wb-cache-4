5|$|Cher Ami, a homing pigeon in World War I, {{was awarded}} the Croix de Guerre Medal, by France, with a palm Oak Leaf Cluster for her service in Verdun. Despite having almost lost a leg and being shot in the chest, it managed to travel around twenty-five miles to deliver <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> saved 194 men of the Lost Battalion of the 77th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Argonne, in October 1918. When Cher Ami died, she was mounted and {{is part of the}} {{permanent}} exhibit at the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E
5|$|The oral {{legends and}} texts {{initiate}} {{a process of}} Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by elevating him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his two principal wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga. Banai {{does not appear in}} the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving from heaven. Banai (Ganga) has a quarrel with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to be a form of Parvati.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in such fashion {{went beyond the}} common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.|$|E

5|$|When Tracy {{causes a}} stir {{at a public}} event, Jack assures him that as a movie star, he can do {{anything}} he wants, except for dog fighting. Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, conveying <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E
5|$|While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean, Corbet {{had made}} the lengthy journey back to Britain. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet had already {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} strict disciplinarian, regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions, {{to the extent that he}} had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808. His reputation spread before him, and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine, he was met with a storm of protest from Africaines crew. Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before, his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew sent a letter to the Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him. Concerned at what they considered to be mutiny, the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts-martial for mutiny but if not, the entire crew would be liable to attack. To emphasise the threat, the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire. Chastened, the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later, carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade Isle de France.|$|E

This paper explores <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> first-year mathematics students receive {{in the context}} of their academic studies during their transition from school to university mathematics. Through observations of lectures and discussions with first-year mathematics undergraduates in an English university, we identified and analysed <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> two of their lecturers transmitted to them during this transitional phase. The results suggest <b>that</b> strongly framed <b>messages</b> are more easily perceived by students and affect them during their transition. Additionally, <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> have been received in the school context continue to have control over students’ thinking and on many occasions can impede adjustment to the new setting...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{three new}} distributed routing algorithms in sensor networks: a distributed minimal power algorithm, a distributed max-min power algorithm, and the distributed max-min zPmin power-aware algorithm. The first two algorithms {{are used to}} define the third, although they are very interesting and useful {{in their own right}} for applications where the optimization criterion is the minimum power, respectively the maximum residual power. By running those algorithms, the nodes in the network reduce the communication by adding a waiting time prior to each broadcast. In this way, some of <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> travel along sub-optimal paths are suppressed. Only <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> travel along <b>the</b> best paths end up being broadcast...|$|R

International governments, human rights groups and art institutions, among others, called for Ai's release, while Chinese officials did not notify Ai's family of his whereabouts.|$|E
