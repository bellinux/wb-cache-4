The literary scholar Susan Johnson Graf categorises these alongside {{the work of}} H. Rider Haggard, Algernon Blackwood, Charles Williams, and Arthur Machen. The other three were romantic thrillers published under the pseudonym of [...] "V. M. Steele": The Scarred Wrists, Hunters of Humans, and Beloved of Ishmael. Writing thrillers was one of few activities Fortune took part in unconnected to her magical work, and was something she did not publicise.

The methods used to derive the Green's function for a coaxial cavity (see [CERN-OPEN- 2009 - 003]) were adapted to deduce novel representations for a bisected geometry, where the additional Dirichlet conditions in phi have to be fulfilled.

2500|$|After <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novels,</b> Beckett {{struggled}} {{for many years}} to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief [...] "stories" [...] later collected as Texts for Nothing. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, Comment c'est (1961; How It Is. An early variant version of Comment c'est, L'Image, was published in the British arts review, [...] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: [...] "You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark" [...] Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. How It Is is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.|$|E

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{properties of}} <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> compounds are investigated by one- and two-photon excitations. These novel compounds are formed by self-assembly of pyrrol- 2 -yl-methyleneamines with zinc (II), which show perfectly symmetries in molecular structures. Intensity dependent fluorescence properties of both one- and two-photon-induced fluorescence excited by an 800 nm, 70 fs laser beam are reported. The fluorescence spectra and the fluorescence lifetimes {{of these new}} compounds obtained by two-photon excitation {{are similar to those}} obtained by one-photon excitation, which indicate that the two-photon-induced photodynamic processes of these complexes are similar to one-photon-induced photodynamic processes. The two-photon excitation cross-sections of these new compounds are also measured at 800 run. The large two-photon excitation cross-sections of <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> compounds indicate their potential properties for two-photon applications in nonlinear optics and biomolecular imaging fields.

40|$|This thesis explores {{in detail}} <b>three</b> academically {{neglected}} <b>novels</b> by Milan Kundera: Slowness (1995), Identity (1998) and Ignorance (2002). Originally written in French, the author’s second language, after six novels, a short-story collection and a play originally written in Czech, these texts are often bracketed {{off from the}} rest of his writing and seen as something of an inferior addendum. This is despite clear thematic similarities that cross the linguistic divide and that I demonstrate here are of central significance to the author’s entire novelistic project. This exploration not only reveals that <b>these</b> <b>three</b> French <b>novels</b> place in the foreground themes that have rippled in and out of focus across Kundera’s earlier Czech work and so are of central importance to Kundera as a novelist. It also shows that the lateness of the variations on the themes of slowness, identity and ignorance within <b>these</b> <b>three</b> French <b>novels</b> does not hold everything in common with the lateness that Adorno locates in late Beethoven. It is true that like late Beethoven, Kundera’s late variations on these themes demonstrate the manoeuvres of an oeuvre sensing its death across the horizon. But through the specific nature of the late variations on slowness, identity and ignorance, the oeuvre works hard to pull its readers down into the textual spaces of <b>these</b> <b>three</b> late <b>novels</b> with a fresh urgency, rather than truculently push them away, so that Kundera’s audience might be adequately prepared to continue its own voyages once the oeuvre has played its final notes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we take three well known Sigma Point Filters, namely the Unscented Kalman Filter, the Divided Difference Filter, and the Cubature Kalman Filter, and extend them {{to allow for}} a very general class of dynamic {{nonlinear}} regime switching models. Using both a Monte Carlo study and real data, we investigate the properties of our proposed filters by using a regime switching DSGE model solved using nonlinear methods. We find that the proposed filters perform well. They are both fast and reasonably accurate, and as a result they will provide practitioners with a convenient alternative to Sequential Monte Carlo methods. We also investigate the concept of observability and its implications {{in the context of the}} nonlinear filters developed and propose some heuristics. Finally, we provide in the RISE toolbox, the codes implementing <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> filters...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of extremely hard ceramic composites can potentially increase the wear resistance of tools and parts considerably. However, their high hardness makes them also {{nearly impossible to}} machine using classical diamond or cBN tools and severely limits the geometrical freedom of the machining process due to the constraints posed by these machining methods. Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) allows {{for the production of}} intricate parts regardless of hardness and is therefore ideally suited for machining ceramic composites, requiring only sufficient electrical conductivity. In this dissertation, <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> conductive ceramic composite classes have been developed (WC-ZrO 2,NbxZr 1 -xB 2 -SiC, TixZr 1 -xB 2 -SiC). Pulsed Electric Current Sintering (PECS) was used as a consolidation technique in order to retain fine microstructures which lead to superior hardness and strength.

40|$|Chromosome 13 q 14 deletions {{constitute}} {{the most common}} structural aberration in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We constructed a high-resolution physical map covering the critical deleted region in B-CLL at 13 q 14 and flanking sequences. The order and position of both genomic markers and known genes were determined precisely. <b>Three</b> <b>novel</b> genes, CLLD 6, CLLD 7, and CLLD 8, were isolated and characterized. The predicted protein sequence of CLLD 6 revealed no homology with known proteins. However, both CLLD 7 and CLLD 8 predicted proteins contain known functional domains. CLLD 7 has both an RCC 1 and a BTB domain, and could thus be involved in cell cycle regulation by chromatin remodeling. CLLD 8 contains a methyl-CpG binding, a preSET and a SET domain, suggesting that CLLD 8 might be associated with methylation-mediated transcriptional repression. Mutation analysis of hematopoietic tumor cell lines and B-CLL tumor samples revealed no point mutations within the coding region of <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> genes. The functional domains present within CLLD 7 and CLLD 8 suggest that the proteins {{may be involved in}} critical cellular processes such as cell cycle and transcriptional control and could therefore be directly or indirectly involved in leukemogenesi...|$|R

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix {{is a vital}} compartment in plants with {{a prominent role in}} defence against pathogen attack. Using a maize cell suspension culture system and pathogen elicitors, responses to pathogen attack that are localised to the {{extracellular matrix}} were examined by a proteomic approach. Elicitor treatment of cell cultures induced a rapid change in the phosphorylation status of extracellular peroxidases, the apparent disappearance of a putative extracellular beta-N-acetylglucosamonidase, and accumulation of a secreted putative xylanase inhibitor protein. Onset of the defence response was attended by an accumulation of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and a fragment of a putative heat shock protein. Several distinct spots of both proteins, which preferentially accumulated in cell wall protein fractions, were identified. <b>These</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> observations, viz. (i) secretion of a new class of putative enzyme inhibitor, (ii) the apparent recruitment of classical cytosolic proteins into the cell wall and (ii) the change in phosphorylation status of extracellular matrix proteins, suggest that the extracellular matrix plays a complex role in defence.

We investigated the presence of Epstein-Barr virus-related viruses in 79 samples of New World monkeys caught in the wild, including six species of the Cebidae family and one of the Callitrichidae, living in the rain forest of French Guiana. Using a degenerate consensus PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, we identified <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> lymphocryptoviruses from golden-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas) of the Callitrichidae family and squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia) of the Cebidae family. With the CalHV- 3 strain, <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> viruses constitute a well-supported phylogenetic clade in the Lymphocryptovirus genus, which is clearly distinct from the lineage of Old World lymphocryptovirus, hosted by catarrhine monkeys and humans. In tamarins, the prevalence of the novel lymphocryptovirus was more than 50 %, indicating that it circulates well in the wild population, perhaps due to specific ecoethological patterns such as confrontations and intergroup migration. The detection and partial molecular characterization of the polymerase gene of <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> Gamma- 1 -Herpesvirinae from New World monkeys caught in the wild clearly indicate that free-ranging populations of platyrrhine are natural hosts of lymphocryptoviruses.

40|$|To develop {{informative}} {{tools for}} the study of population affinities in African Americans, we sequenced the hypervariable segments I and II (HVS I and HVS II) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 96 Sierra Leoneans; European Americans; rural, Gullah-speaking African Americans; urban African Americans living in Charleston, South Carolina; and Jamaicans. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exhibiting ethnic affinities, and developed restriction endonuclease tools to screen these SNPs. Here we show that three HVS restriction site polymorphisms (RSPs), EcoRV, FokI, and MfeI, exhibit appreciable differences in frequency (average δ = 0. 4165) between putative African American parental populations (i. e., extant Africans living in Sierra Leone and European Americans). Estimates of European American mtDNA admixture, calculated from haplotypes composed of <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> RSPs, show a cline of increasing admixture from Gullah-speaking African American (m = 0. 0300) to urban Charleston African American (m = 0. 0689) to West Coast African American (m = 0. 1769) populations.

40|$|Neuronal Cdc 2 -like kinase (Nclk) is {{involved}} in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and neuro-cytoskeleton dynamics. The active kinase consists of a catalytic subunit, Cdk 5, and a 25 kDa activator protein (p 25 (nck 5 a)) derived from a 35 kDa neuronal-specific protein (p 35 (nck 5 a)). As an extension of our previous study (Qi, Z., Tang, D., Zhu, X., Fujita, D. J., Wang, J. H., 1998. Association of neurofilament proteins with neuronal Cdk 5 activator. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2329 - 2335), which showed that neurofilament is one of the p 35 (nck 5 a) -associated proteins, we now report the isolation of <b>three</b> other <b>novel</b> p 35 (nck 5 a) -associated proteins using the yeast two-hybrid screen. The full-length forms of <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>novel</b> proteins, designated C 42, C 48 and C 53, have a molecular mass of 66, 24, and 57 kDa, respectively. Northern analysis indicates that these novel proteins are widely expressed in human tissues, including the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas. The bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) -fusion forms of <b>these</b> <b>three</b> proteins were able to co-precipitate p 35 (nck 5 a) complexed with Cdk 5 from insect cell lysate. Among <b>these</b> <b>three</b> proteins, only C 48 and C 53 can be phosphorylated by Nclk, suggesting that they may be the substrates of Nclk. Sequence homology searches have suggested that the C 48 protein is marginally related to restin protein, whereas the C 42 protein has homologues of unknown function in Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana.
