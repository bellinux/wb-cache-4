5|$|FSB 30 {{lasted only}} about one week longer. Although the {{steepness}} of the hill on which the base was situated precluded armored attack, the PAVN artillery bombardment was very effective. By 3 March the base's six 105mm and six 155mm howitzers had been put out of action. In an attempt to relieve the firebase, ARVN armor and infantry of the 17th Cavalry moved out <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>their</b> comrades.|$|E

5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>their</b> lives in {{a process known as}} autotomy. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone {{at the base of the}} tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis wasps {{frequently}} {{interact with}} humans {{because of their}} tendency to make their nests in backyards, gardens and sidewalks. Pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest in areas with little to no vegetation, usually ignore people, and females are not aggressive, tending <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>their</b> venom for their cicada prey, but will sting if they are grabbed or stepped on. Despite their large size, being the largest wasp to inhabit California, their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate. Males, while smaller, are naturally more aggressive and less tolerant of disturbance.|$|E
