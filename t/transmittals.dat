40|$|Abstract: Meaningful {{interoperability}} between physics-based models {{requires a}} common understanding and stan-dardized {{description of the}} physical laws governing physical objects, i. e., an ontology of physics and the resulting metadata. For example, currently, the Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specifica-tion (SEDRIS) standard addresses the description of model data objects, their spatiotemporal coordinates, and many physical attributes. What is not described in SEDRIS are model dynamics, i. e., how a model evolves in time between the discrete states that are represented in <b>transmittals.</b> If model dynamics are not specified with the data, a data recipient {{will be required to}} infer how he/she should use the received data, making an inference that will vary depending on the recipient. Of the many factors that may affect model dynamics, such as military doctrine, human behavior, or physics, we focus on representing physical dynamics. This is commonly a necessary aspect of model dynamics. The key concepts in representing physical dynamics are the equations of physics, usually phrased as differential equations, and how they relate to static representations of physical objects, such as those represented in SEDRIS. This paper frames the structure of how to incorporate considerations of dynamics in an ontology of physics and begins to detail the types of physical dynamical relationships that may be modeled. ...|$|E

40|$|Report of {{the second}} {{external}} management review of ICARDA conducted in 1988 concurrently with an external program review, John Dillon serving {{as chair of the}} review panel. The document contains <b>transmittals</b> by Dillon and the Executive Secretary of the CGIAR, as well as the review proper. The comments of the ICARDA board and management are found in a separate record. CGIAR discussion of both reviews is found in the record of the CGIAR meeting of October-November 1988 and also in the record for the external program review. The panel found that ICARDA had been slow to implement the recommendations of the first external management review. In response the Executive Secretary recommended and the Group endorsed an interim review after two years to check up on progress. In what was cited as a ground breaking step, the review included an appraisal of the organizational culture of ICARDA, and contained recommendations for influencing the culture toward a more problem-solving approach. The center was praised for its development of physical infrastructure, and criticized for performance on various aspects of financial, administrative and human resources management.

The NRC stated that this combined approach of testing and engineering analysis to meet the three-hour requirement for a fire barrier design had not been clearly understood in previous <b>transmittals</b> of information and would require further evaluation by the NRC. In order to support the additional evaluation, the NRC requested the following additional information: " * Provide an engineering ev 4 luation to address the structural differences between the tested configuration and the as-install configuration, specifically for 1) the angle iron size differences, 2) the difference in panel spans, and 3) penetration seal configurations.

H. Arnold, chairman of the EPR panel, a response from IITA, TAC's commentary, and {{the text of the}} report of the EPR of IITA, which was conducted during September and October 1983. The panel suggested that IITA should have a global mandate for research in high rainfall, low altitude tropics. There was a danger that too much identification with Nigeria, or even a region of Africa, might invite political interference. The panel believed that IITA should have the CGIAR mandate for soybeans, starchy bananas, and cocoyams. TAC joined the panel in citing research progress on breeding cassava varieties resistant to diseases, biological control of cassava pests, weevil resistant sweet potatoes, improved methods for propagating yams, short duration varieties of cowpea, and genetic resistance to maize streak virus. TAC recommended that IITA should decentralize its activities more beyond its host country. TAC saw IITA's mandate as involving work on farming systems and crops for which it held secondary responsibilities in the humid and sub-humid areas only, and work on its primary mandate crops, cowpeas, yams, and sweet potatoes, in collaboration with other centers on a global basis...|$|E

The document also contains an extract from the summary of proceedings of the CGIAR mid term meeting of May 1997, and <b>transmittals</b> {{of each of the}} two documents from the TAC Chairman. Work on the priorities and strategies paper began at TAC 66 in March 1995, and continued until the paper was made final at TAC 72 in March 1997. Underlying priorities concerns were discussed at ICW 95. In its final paper, TAC emphasized the goals of poverty alleviation, natural resource conservation, alternative sources of supply of CGIAR products, and the likelihood of success. The paper includes annexes defining CGIAR activities, describing the methodologies used, and providing an overview of production sectors and commodities. At TAC 72, the Committee approved the allocation to centers for the period. It recommended that funding for centers should be based on a $ 400 million total, and interim allocations should move toward that level. During MTM 97, the CGIAR divided into parallel sessions to review individual center medium term plans. It approved a financial planning target for 1998 of $ 335 to$ 340 million, somewhat lower than recommended by TAC...|$|E

The document contains {{a summary of the}} discussion of both reviews at the CGIAR meeting in May 1990, <b>transmittals</b> from the chairs of the panel and TAC, a TAC commentary approved at TAC 50, CIAT's response, and the conclusions and recommendations of the external management review performed concurrently. The panel made 25 recommendations, three of which were joint with the EMR. TAC made a number of suggestions about revisions to CIAT's strategic plan, for example concerning the long term viability of a low input strategy. The plan was to be revised under the new director general. The panel commented on mandate, strategy and research priorities, and reviewed the work of the bean, cassava, rice and tropical pastures programs. It also considered supporting research and other services, and discussed seven selected themes of CIAT research. Other sections of the report dealt with international cooperation, training and communications. A chapter on organizational structure and process was prepared jointly with the EMR panel. Recommendations concern, among other things, the screening and processing of backlogged bean germplasm materials; identification of major constraints to bean production in Africa; establishment of an internal biosafety committee; population improvement and yield measurement methodologies used by the rice program; increased fund raising for the seed unit, and appointment of a Coordinator of Research Support...|$|E
40|$|External {{program review}} of ICARDA {{conducted}} in 1988, concurrently with an external management review, {{by a panel}} chaired by Dr. Dieter F. R. Bommer. The document contains {{a summary of the}} CGIAR discussion of the two reviews at its meeting of October-November 1988, a TAC commentary, ICARDA's response, <b>transmittals</b> from the chairmen of the panel and TAC, and the conclusions and recommendations of the EMR. The report was discussed at TAC 46. The review characterized ICARDA as a firmly established and mature IARC with visible and accumulating impact on national programs in the Middle East and North Africa Region. Reviewers called for ICARDA's strategic plan to be more explicit, with more analysis underpinning proposed decision making and priority setting in the center's future program. Increased research is suggested on winter rainfall farming systems, water harvesting and supplemental irrigation, and efficiency of water use. The panel endorsed the focus on lentils because of their importance as livestock feed and in human diets. Members recommended stopping faba bean improvement research and reducing work on food legumes, increased staffing of socioeconomic research (including a full time social anthropologist), and increased livestock research. Linkages with basic research institutions and establishment of a biotechnology laboratory were encouraged with the caveat that such upstream work be needs-driven and problem-oriented. There were several joint recommendations with the EMR panel. The panel endorsed decentralization of ICARDA's regional program to strategic locations in the region made necessary by the region's agroecological heterogeneity...|$|E
