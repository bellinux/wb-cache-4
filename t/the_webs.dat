5|$|<b>The</b> <b>webs</b> of spiders {{on which}} Portia species prey {{sometimes}} contain dead insects and other arthropods which are uneaten or partly eaten. P. fimbriata (in Queensland) {{and some other}} Portia species such as P. labiata and P. schultzi sometimes scavenge these corpses if the corpses are not obviously decayed.|$|E
5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} to jump into <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity {{as a type of}} smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them to trap prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> as much as twice their own body length to trap prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: backwards strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>webs</b> are permanent. Over time, {{they will}} begin {{gathering}} leaves and other debris. Double-tailed tent spiders will regularly clean their webs, usually at night, though they will retain some {{bits and pieces}} of debris for camouflage. <b>The</b> <b>webs</b> sometimes have to be rebuilt when severely damaged.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{location}} {{has become very}} popular in many applications on <b>the</b> <b>Web,</b> in particular for those which aim at connecting the real world with resources on <b>the</b> <b>Web.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>Web</b> {{as it is today}} has no overall location concept, which means that applications have to introduce their own location concepts and have done so in incompatible ways. By turning <b>the</b> <b>Web</b> into a location-aware Web, which we call <b>the</b> “Locative <b>Web,</b> ” location-oriented applications get better support for their location concepts on <b>the</b> <b>Web,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Web</b> becomes an information system where locationrelated information can be more easily shared across different applications and application areas.

25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large size of web, they are often infested with kleptoparasitic split-faced silver spiders (Argyrodes fissifrons). While able to build webs of their own, dewdrop spiders (genus Argyrodes) prefer to live and even reproduce in <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> of other spiders, stealing prey in the process. They can be permanently associated with one web or move around between several other tent webs in the immediate vicinity. The size of the web is directly proportional {{to the number of}} A. fissifrons inhabiting them. The relationships can sometimes be commensal or even mutual, as A. fissifrons eat prey entangled in <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> that are too small for the larger double-tailed tent spiders. However, they often help themselves to food stores or even food {{in the process of being}} consumed by the hosts as well. Larger individuals are more audacious, but they usually stay on the tangle webs and out of the way of their hosts. Double-tailed tent spiders seem to tolerate their presence though they sometimes have to shove them away when they catch larger prey.|$|E
