5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game {{is similar to}} rock, paper, scissors, but the three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats <b>the</b> <b>hunter,</b> whom he outranks; <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> fleet endured several {{attempts}} to procure successor aircraft to the type; {{in the case}} of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than the attributes of <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> itself. A second attempt to replace <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II. Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner, it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters (22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers) were purchased in 1974 instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{definitive}} {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> was the FGA.9, {{on which the}} majority of export versions were based. Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government, <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> proved far more successful, and had a lengthy service life with various operators, {{in part due to}} its low maintenance requirements and operating costs.|$|E
5|$|As the RAF {{received}} newer aircraft {{capable of}} supersonic speeds {{to perform the}} air interceptor role, many Hunters were modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead. Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF's requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad. <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> would be procured by {{a considerable number of}} foreign nations. In addition to former RAF aircraft, roughly half of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers. <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years. As late as 1996, hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid to replace <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> in the air-to-air role {{with a more}} modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia, and <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> was the nation's primary and most capable interceptor. During the conflict, <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> demonstrated its superiority over China's Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air. India's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India. In 1962, India had selected to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the interceptor role by 1970.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> Mariners were an Australian {{professional}} rugby league club {{based in}} <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> Region's largest city, Newcastle. Hunter {{was formed in}} mid-1995 and was later disbanded {{at the end of}} 1997. The club was formed because of the Super League war, which was the rivalry between the traditional Australian Rugby League competition and the new media driven Super League competition. The team competed in the inaugural and only Super League season in 1997, as well as that year's World Club Challenge.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force as an {{interceptor}} aircraft. It {{was the first}} jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset {{it was clear that}} the type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time, enabled by features such as its removable gun pack, pressurised fuelling system, and easy handling in flight.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> saw combat {{service in}} a range of {{conflicts}} with several operators, including the Suez Crisis, the Aden Emergency, the Sino-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Rhodesian Bush War, the Second Congo War, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War, and the 2007 Lebanon conflict. Overall, 1,972 Hunters were manufactured by Hawker Aircraft and its successor, Hawker Siddeley, as well as being produced under licence overseas. In British service, <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> was replaced in its principal roles by the Lightning, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> {{was to play}} a {{major role}} during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; along with the Gnat <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> was India's primary air defence fighter, and {{regularly}} engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in the air war, Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|The {{acquisition}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> had solved {{part of the}} Swiss dilemma of needing to support both its ground forces and to deploy an air-to-air capability, but while <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> could provide some counter-air defense over a battlefield and escort ground-support fighters it was not supersonic nor was it capable of defending Swiss airspace. In 1961, the Swiss Parliament voted to procure 100French Dassault Mirage IIICs for this purpose and 67BL-64 Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles from the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E
5000|$|Not all of <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> get to hunt; one Hunter is {{selected}} in some episodes to be a [...] "Spotter", {{whose job is}} to drive around the game board in a special vehicle and locate the contestants for <b>the</b> other <b>Hunters,</b> relaying <b>the</b> contestants' position to the others, though they themselves are forbidden from making any captures. <b>The</b> <b>Hunters</b> are forced to ignore the camera crews, and are only allowed to break chase when they see a Runner. <b>The</b> <b>Hunters</b> do not communicate to any of the contestants.|$|R
