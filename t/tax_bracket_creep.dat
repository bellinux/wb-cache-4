Taxpayers with 1982 incomes between $ 10, 000 and $ 22, 000 are found to have suffered from bracket creep while receiving little relief through discretionary tax cuts.

40|$|This Thesis uses several {{forms of}} a single-period option-based model {{to analyze the}} {{incidence}} of income tax under uncertainty, focusing on the various effects of tax asymmetries and observing the distinct features of individual and corporate taxation. Two particular applications are being advanced. The one strives to establish the economic effects of tax-deductibility, motivated initially by a thin-capitalization measure brought forth under {{the framework of the}} recent Czech public-finance reform. The pother one compares the terms of three distinct personal income-tax schedules, as they have been recently applied in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, investigating particular issues such as tiered rates, mandatory minimum <b>tax,</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>creep,</b> social taxes, as well as tax incidence in general. On the whole, we find that option-based models are well suited for miscellaneous forms of economic analysis under dynamic assumptions, overcoming the inherent limitations of comparative statics routinely used by mainstream economics. We also conclude that the Czech tax reform of 2008 has failed to achieve the level of economic neutrality and simplicity, characteristical for the Slovak flat-tax schedule of 2004. There are cases, where it has actually contributed to the emergence of new asymmetries...|$|E

50|$|One {{cause of}} fiscal drag may be <b>bracket</b> <b>creep,</b> where {{progressive}} taxation increases automatically as taxpayers move into higher <b>tax</b> <b>brackets</b> due to inflation.

50|$|Tax laws {{might not}} be {{accurately}} indexed to inflation. For example, some tax laws may ignore inflation completely. In a progressive tax system, failure to index the brackets to inflation will eventually result in effective tax increases (if inflation is sustained), as inflation in wages will increase individual income and move individuals into higher <b>tax</b> <b>brackets</b> with higher percentage rates.

40|$|We quantitatively {{analyze the}} way {{inflation}} alters the inequality {{of the income}} distribution in the U. S. economy.

40|$|Australian taxpayers face {{a future}} tax {{increase}} of $ 1, 180 {{a year on}} average if nothing is done about <b>bracket</b> <b>creep,</b> according to this report. Introduction There is a large gap between what the Australian government raises in taxes and what it spends. As a result, the government has posted eight consecutive budget deficits, and the former Treasurer Joe Hockey has stated the budget may never get back to surplus under current policies. In addition, many commentators are calling for additional revenue to be raised to reduce the budget deficit or provide scope for additional government spending. Nevertheless, there are many arguments against increasing personal taxes. Most importantly, they are inefficient taxes that have substantial harmful impacts on work, saving, investment and growth. But also no clear case {{has been made to}} increase taxes instead of curbing spending growth. The importance of tax reform has been acknowledged by many governments in Australia’s recent history. The previous Labor government commissioned the Australia’s Future Tax System Review, chaired by Dr Ken Henry, in 2008. The Final Report of the review was released in 2010; however, most of the recommendations of the Henry review were not implemented. The Coalition government has now initiated its own tax review and released a discussion paper on 30 March 2015, called Re:think. The government must seize the opportunity from this process to fix some of the glaring problems with Australia’s tax system. The Re:think discussion paper specifically raises the problem of <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> (or fiscal drag), when average tax rates rise automatically in an economy with inflation and growing wages. Our paper shows <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> is causing substantial tax increases and as a result is reducing employment and labour force participation. As the Re:think discussion paper notes, Australia relies more on income taxes than other developed (OECD) countries. This causes our tax system to be more inefficient, because income taxes have more adverse effects than other taxes. It also means that <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> has a greater impact in Australia than in other countries. Importantly, <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> isn’t just inefficient; this paper demonstrates it also is regressive because it disproportionately hits low- to middle-income earners. Nevertheless, the excuses not to fix <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> multiply as the demands for increased government spending continue and a number of spending commitments, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), are locked in. However, as this report will show, the consequences of ignoring <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> are severe. Fixing <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> must be a serious priority for all politicians.  ...|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} two tax rates realize an equal savings or {{discount}} {{from taking the}} maximum allowable deductions, the higher income <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> {{would have to have}} an effective tax rate of ~24.35% (31%-24.35%/31% = 21.4% or the same discount as the lower <b>tax</b> <b>bracket)</b> instead of 23%. This would necessitate an additional income tax of $1,975 from the higher <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> ($200,000*24.35% and equal effective tax rate = $48,700), or an extra 0.99% in this model.|$|R
