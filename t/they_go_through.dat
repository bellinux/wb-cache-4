5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E

At {{some point during the}} events of XIII-2, Sazh is sucked through a rip in time, is {{separated}} from Dajh and ends up in Serendipity, a palace in the Void Beyond. While there, he meets Chocolina and learns of the fate facing the world from Serendipity's owner. Reuniting with Dajh and deciding to fight no matter what the future holds, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a time gate and help Serah and Noel in their battle against Caius. Sazh then helps Hope save Fang and Vanille from the crystal pillar before Cocoon falls. In Lightning Returns, Sazh has set up his home in the Wildlands. After Dajh's soul is lost and his body falls into a coma, Sazh becomes tormented by his seeming failure to protect his son. Lightning helps retrieve the fragments of Dajh's soul, lifting Sazh's burden.|$|E
5|$|The family finds {{work in a}} fish-gutting {{factory in}} Osaka, where they notice a TV game show called The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> {{physical}} torture (particularly Homer), then must pick them up from a rickety bridge over an active volcano. Lisa is {{able to get the}} tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually orangeade with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before it flies off on the journey to Springfield.|$|E

5|$|When flux tubes {{loaded with}} the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a {{reconnection}} process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma. The former returns to the inner magnetosphere {{in the form of}} flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of plasmoids—large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo probe, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days. The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere. The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.|$|E

As some forms of matter go from solid to liquid <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a third state, which {{displays}} properties of both phases. This anisotropic liquid is known as a liquid crystalline or mesomorphous state. Using DSC, it is possible to observe the small energy changes that occur as matter transitions from a solid to a liquid crystal and from a liquid crystal to an isotropic liquid.|$|E

A candidate must take an absolute majority (more than 50%) in their constituency to win in the first round, and receive the support of at least 25% of all registered voters. Otherwise, if they get at least 12.5% of the votes of all registered voters in the first round, or are one of the top two candidates remaining, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> to the second round, where only a simple plurality is needed to win.|$|E
25|$|The skin of {{children}} becomes darker as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> puberty {{and experience the}} effects of sex hormones. This darkening is especially noticeable in {{the skin of the}} nipples, the areola of the nipples, the labia majora in females, and the scrotum in males. In some people, the armpits become slightly darker during puberty. The interaction of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors on skin coloration with age is still not adequately understood, but it is known that men are at their darkest baseline skin color around the age of 30, without considering the effects of tanning. Around the same age, women experience darkening of some areas of their skin.|$|E

25|$|Assuming and {{initiating}} {{care has}} been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy (aloha). As children mature within the family, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide {{and care for the}} younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a {{holometabolous}} lifecycle, meaning <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina typically has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation if the right conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop. In general, the warmer it is, the faster the lifecycle will go; while if it is colder, the lifecycle may take longer than usual. This {{has to be taken}} into account when estimating the postmortem interval.|$|E
25|$|Generally, when {{an inmate}} {{arrives at a}} prison, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a {{security}} classification screening and risk assessment that determines {{where they will be}} placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will {{have a major impact on}} the prisoner's experience, determining their security level, educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. will they be placed in a mental health unit), and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the prison administration maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment. At most prisons, prisoners are made to wear prison uniform.|$|E
