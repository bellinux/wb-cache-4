5|$|In {{order to}} obtain support from the Imperial Japanese Army for <b>the</b> <b>Midway</b> operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy agreed to support their {{invasion}} of the Aleutian Islands. The IJA wished to occupy the western Aleutians to place the Japanese home islands {{out of range of}} U.S. land-based bombers based in Alaska. The Japanese operations in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas many earlier historical accounts considered the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, early twenty-first century research has suggested that AL was intended to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway. A one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before <b>the</b> <b>Midway</b> attack.|$|E
