50|$|Mice {{knock out}} and {{other studies have}} been used to {{determine}} which ADAR enzyme are involved in editing. Editing at A and B sites has been demonstrated to be due to ADAR1 editing. Also since ADAR1 expression is increased in response to the presence of interferon α, it was also observed that editing at A and B sites was also increased because of this. C' and D sites require ADAR2 and editing is decreased by the presence of ADAR1 with editing of C' site only observed in ADAR1 double knock out mice. The C site {{has been shown to be}} mainly edited by ADAR2 but in presence of upregulated expression of ADAR1, there was an increase in editing of this site and the enzymes presence can also result in limited editing in ADAR 2 knock out mice.

50|$|Work {{performed}} in the Bradbury laboratory showed that nucleosomes reconstituted onto the 5S DNA positioning sequence were able to reposition themselves translationally onto adjacent sequences when incubated thermally. Later work showed that this repositioning did not require disruption of the histone octamer but was consistent with nucleosomes being able to “slide” along the DNA in cis. In 2008, It was further revealed that CTCF binding sites act as nucleosome positioning anchors so that, when used to align various genomic signals, multiple flanking nucleosomes can be readily identified. Although nucleosomes are intrinsically mobile, eukaryotes have evolved a large family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes to alter chromatin structure, many of which do so via nucleosome sliding. In 2012, Beena Pillai's laboratory has demonstrated that nucleosome sliding {{is one of the}} possible mechanism for large scale <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> of genes.

50|$|The 5-HT2c {{receptor}} is {{the only}} serotonin receptor edited despite its close sequence similarities to other family members. 5HT2CR is different due to possessing an imperfect inverted repeat {{at the end of}} exon 5 and the beginning of intron 5 allowing formation of an RNA duplex producing the dsRNA required by ADARs for editing. Disruption of this inverted repeat was demonstrated to cease all editing. The different 5HT2CR mRNA isoforms are expressed differently throughout the brain, yet not all of the 24 have been detected perhaps due to <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> or low frequency editing of a particular type.

40|$|The {{activation}} of <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> genes relies upon the precise orchestration {{of a number}} of events that result in the initiation of transcription upon lineage specification. This process is heavily dictated by the chromatin environment both at the promoter and distal sequences, {{as well as by the}} availability of transcription factors necessary for activation. A critical role is played at distal regulatory sequences, which often are the first sites to be engaged by key regulatory proteins. This interaction often promotes a chromatin environment that is necessary for the {{activation of}} the gene and results in the recruitment of additional sequence specific factors and a direct interaction with the promoter to initiate transcription. Understanding the properties of enhancer elements for <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> genes is important for a clear understanding of the mechanisms of activation. A number of studies have shown that enhancers are marked long before the activation of the gene takes place, in some cases as early as the embryonic stem cell stage. A detailed study described an unmethylated window within the enhancer of the Ptcra locus. Further analysis showed the enhancer mark to be regulated by sequence specific binding factors. These studies lacked the appropriate chromatin environment, which we know to be important. Here we use bacterial artificial chromosome containing the Ptcra locus to demonstrate that the enhancer mark persists in a chromatin context but is not regulated in the manner described in a non-native chromatin context. We then expand our studies to global <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> gene <b>expression</b> in order to understand more broadly the regulatory properties the define <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> genes.

Liver {{has a unique}} {{capacity}} to regenerate itself upon exposure to viral infections, toxic reactions and cancer formation which result {{in the loss of}} hepatocyte. Liver regeneration is a complex phenomenon in which several factors participate during its onset. Cellular proliferation is one of the important component of this process and the factors regulate this proliferation has a vital role. FLT 3, a well-known hematopoietic stem cell and hepatic lineage surface marker, takes place in proliferative events of hematopoietic stem cells. However, its contribution to liver regeneration is not known. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the role of FLT 3 during liver regeneration.

40|$|Mitogen Regulated Protein (MRP; {{also called}} Proliferin; or MRP/PLF) {{is a member}} of the Prolactin/Growth Hormone gene family. There is {{evidence}} that MRP/PLF is a uterine growth factor and an angiogenesis factor. Between four and six highly homologous MRP/PLF genes (mrp/plf) exist in the mouse, but the significance of multiple genes has not been determined. MRP/Plf is produced at high levels during mid-gestation by the placenta, where expression is restricted to the trophoblastic giant cells. To better understand the regulation of the mrp/ plf genes in vivo, we have developed an assay to analyze the temporal expression pattern of different mrp/plf genes during gestation. We identified mrp/plf 3 as the major placental mrp/plf during gestation, and also identified and cloned a new mrp/plf (mrp/plf 4), which has a different temporal expression profile than mrp/plf 3. We further investigated the spatial expression of mrp/plf genes in vivo and found that different mrp/plf genes have distinct expression patterns in the adult mouse. Mrp/ plf 4 is the major mrp/plf in the skin of ears and tail, plf 1 is the major mrp/ plf of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract, and mrp/plf 3 is expressed by keratinocytes during wound healing and the hair follicle cycle;Further studies were done to define elements involved in <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> of the mrp/plf 3 gene. 1. 5 kb of 52 ̆ 7 sequence and 3 kb of 32 ̆ 7 sequence are able to drive lacZ reporter gene expression in transiently transfected cells, but are unable to direct detectable <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> in transgenic embryos or mice.

40|$|One of {{the current}} {{challenges}} in gene therapy is to construct a vector that will target <b>specific</b> <b>tissues.</b> Targeting <b>expression</b> to endothelium {{is of particular interest}} in the treatment of several pathologies. We have shown previously that defined regions of the E-selectin and KDR promoters confer endothelial cell <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> following retroviral delivery. However, the levels of expression were low. In an attempt to increase expression but to preserve the tissue specificity we have examined hypoxic and cytokine-inducible enhancer elements in combination with the KDR and E-selectin promoters. Both enhancers should be active in the tumour environment, boosting expression and giving additional specificity of gene expression in the tumour endothelium. The hypoxia response element (HRE) of the murine phosphoglycerate kinase- 1 (PGK- 1) promoter was used as a hypoxic enhancer and the tandem-binding site for NFKB from the murine vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) promoter as a cytokine-inducible enhancer. The HRE conferred hypoxia inducibility to the KDR and E-selectin promoters. Endothelial specificity of expression was retained with the KDR but not the E-selectin promoter. The NFKB-binding site conferred responsiveness to TNF-alpha to the KDR promoter, however the level of induction was less than that achieved with the HRE. Retrovirus combining both enhancer elements transferred inducibility by hypoxia and TNF-alpha, and reached the highest expression levels upon stimulation. These results confirm that heterologous enhancer elements may operate on a single endothelial cell specific promoter.

40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of gene promoters {{is essential to}} understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation required under the effects of physiological processes, nutritional intake or pathologies. In higher eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation implies the recruitment {{of a set of}} regulatory proteins that bind on combinations of nucleotide motifs. We developed a computational {{analysis of}} promoter nucleotide sequences, to identify co-regulated genes by combining several programs that allowed us to build regulatory models and perform a crossed analysis on several databases. This strategy was tested on a set of four human genes encoding isoforms 1 to 4 of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier ANT. Each isoform has a <b>specific</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>expression</b> profile linked to its role in cellular bioenergetics. Results: From their promoter sequence and from the phylogenetic evolution of these ANT genes in mammals, we constructed combinations of specific regulatory elements. These models were screened using the full human genome and databases of promoter sequences from human and several other mammalian species. For each of transcriptionally regulated ANT 1, 2 and 4 genes, a set of co-regulated genes was identified and their over-expression was verified in microarray databases. Conclusions: Most of the identified genes encode proteins with a cellular function and specificity in agreement with those of the corresponding ANT isoform. Our in silico study shows that the <b>tissue</b> <b>specific</b> gene <b>expression</b> is mainly driven by promoter regulatory sequences located up to about a thousand base pairs upstream the transcription start site.
