5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F.

Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{religion}} in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> includes {{all forms of}} religious organisation and belief in Scotland in <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> This period saw {{the beginnings of a}} fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, {{led to the creation of}} a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church.|$|E

5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
