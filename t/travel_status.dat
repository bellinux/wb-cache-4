40|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} indications of destination image to vary with factors like <b>travel</b> <b>status</b> and tourist behaviour, {{there are few}} studies that have empirically researched the variations in destination image particularly in emerging destinations like those in Africa. This study aimed at testing the variation of pre- and post trip destination image held by inbound travellers to Tanzania. Four hypotheses were defined to test variation of destination image with <b>travel</b> <b>status,</b> destination familiarity, planning horizon, and sources of travel information. Data were collected from departing inbound tourists at major international airports using a self-administered questionnaire. Data from 294 dully filled questionnaires were subjected to descriptive tests, t-tests and ANOVA tests. The hypotheses testing the variation between pre and post destination image, visitation status, and planning horizon were partly rejected. The results indicate the post-trip destination image to be more favourable compared to the pre-trip image for some attributes. Differences in image were noted to vary between first time and repeat visitors, particularly those related to adventure, natural attractions, and the easiness in intra-destination travel. Generally, as the planning horizon increases the destination image becomes more favourable. The variation of destination image with sources of travel information was not upheld by the results. The results provide insights into destination marketing and destination experience management to tourism stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|With the {{improvement}} of China’s high-speed rail network, {{there have been many}} economic and social benefits for local residents. Based on a questionnaire conducted in stations on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and through an analysis of high-speed rail passenger travel behavior and family relocation, we explored the social effects of high-speed rail. The study found that high-speed rail passengers are mainly young, highly educated, and have a middle to high income. However, with the popularization of high-speed rail, such differences in the social stratum of high-speed rail passengers are expected to disappear. Through an analysis of passenger <b>travel</b> <b>status,</b> we found that the areas surrounding high-speed rail stations are very accessible to the main cities, and are well connected by other public transport. With the emergence of the “high mobility era” based on the high-speed rail network, the separation of workplace and residence and the number of “double city” households are increasing, primarily in the Beijing-Tianjin and Shanghai-Nanjing (especially in Suzhou-Kunshan-Shanghai) regions. In addition, high-speed rail introduces the possibility of household mobility, with 22. 7 % of the respondents in this study having relocated since the Beijing-Shanghai line opened. Household mobility is apparent primarily among big cities, with movement toward nearby cities. We also found that occupation, income, residence time, and schooling of children {{have a significant impact on}} households.

No {{resistance was}} found in isolates known to be locally acquired. In Australia, fluoroquinolones have not been licensed for use in food production animals, a policy that may have relevance for countries with fluoroquinoloneresistant Campylobacter. In Australia, Campylobacter is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne pathogen with an annual incidence of 125 / 100, 000 population (1). Fluoroquinolone resistance in this pathogen is recognized as an emerging public health problem related {{to the use of}} these antimicrobial agents in food production animals. Data from many regions (United States, Europe, and Thailand) that have licensed fluoroquinolones for therapeutic use in animals have shown that such use results in the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli isolates obtained from both humans and animals (2 – 4). Increasing resistance in campylobacter may lead to infections that are unresponsive to antimicrobial drug treatment and more severe disease. Smith (2) demonstrated that resistant C. jejuni caused more prolonged diarrhea in patients than susceptible strains. Fluoroquinolone resistance may emerge during treatment in humans (3); however, Smith (2) and others (5) demonstrated that most detected resistant isolates come from patients who have not been exposed to fluoroquinolones. Furthermore, as human-to-human transmission of campylobacter is rare, patients infected with resistant campylobacter are not an important source of resistance for other humans (4). In Australia, fluoroquinolones have never been licensed for use in food production animals. A small amount is use...|$|E

This study {{is a part of}} a much larger mobility management technology deployment by the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority (CCRTA) that deployed integrated intermodal intelligent transportation system (ITS) to support the mobility of a metropolitan region that has a high proportion of elderly residents and persons with disabilities and is a significant tourist destination for national and international travelers. This paper {{reports on a}} research project that is developing smartphone applications to provide travelers using transit with navigational tools and real-time spatial information to optimize their travel experience. The smart phone applications are written using the Android 2. 2, Windows 7. 5, and Apple iOS 4 operating systems. The applications provide the traveler with schedules for every CCRTA regional and shuttle route, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and bus tracking maps (Google and Bing Maps) that locate the transit vehicle and the consumer on the same map as well as text based vehicle tracking. There is an on-line tutorial on how to use the smartphone application. It also provides features that will provide emergency communication with care givers on the consumer’s <b>travel</b> <b>status.</b> The research has developed these transit navigation tools on the three most popular operating systems for smart phones using a widely available cellular carrier.

40|$|The {{public health}} {{significance}} of campylobacters lies in {{their role as}} enteropathogens of man. Zoonotic in origin, {{they are the most}} commonly reported bacterial cause of gastrointestinal infection in the developed world. Approximately 46, 000 laboratory-confirmed cases are reported annually in England and Wales, and this figure underestimates community disease by a factor of eight. Infection is unpleasant and, whilst self-limiting, a tenth of cases require hospital admission for their illness. Sequelae such Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Reactive Arthritis and Guillain-Barr?? Syndrome compound the problem. Despite the significant public health burden posed by campylobacters, our understanding of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection is limited. This deficiency relates to a combination of the natural history of the microorganism, the high disease incidence which exists and the epidemiological tools applied thus far to its study. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection the Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme was conceived in 1998 and established in 1999. Through the integration of standardised epidemiological and microbiological data, it aimed to generate systematically new hypotheses for potential vehicles of infections, or transmission pathways, for campylobacteriosis. Twenty-two health authorities, representing all NHS regions at that time in England and in Wales and with a population of over 12 million people, participated in the study, which ran from May 2000 until April 2003. Standardised epidemiological data were captured on over 20, 000 cases over the surveillance period and these were combined with microbiological data from detailed strain characterisation of patients??? strains, referred at the same time. Case-case comparisons and disease determinant analysis were the epidemiological tools most commonly applied to the data. The research carried out by the candidate demonstrated that age, gender, ethnicity, occupation and socioeconomic status are major determinants for Campylobacter infection in England and Wales, and that variation in behaviour throughout the week also has a bearing on risk. It has shown that campylobacteriosis cannot be considered a single disease, as exposure differences exist in cases infected with different Campylobacter species or subspecies, and these differences can be confounded by foreign <b>travel</b> <b>status.</b> The fact that disease incidence amongst foreign travellers is country-specific suggests that the above exposure differences will be confounded further by travel destination. It has shown that outbreaks of campylobacteriosis occur more commonly than described previously, suggesting that an opportunity for furthering our understanding of infection is being missed. Finally, the dose-response relationship for Campylobacter infection has been investigated, highlighting potential implications for the design of future epidemiological studies. Policy makers should be aware that future case-control studies of Campylobacter infection will need to be larger or more complex, and hence more costly. Such costs should be weighed against the opportunity for a more accurate assessment of disease risk, leading to improved evidence-based policy development. Researchers should focus on assessing rapidly and by non-invasive means, previous exposure to campylobacters amongst healthy controls, improving further the accuracy of case-control studies, which remain the epidemiological method of choice for studying this disease.

40|$|Objective - This paper aims at {{describing}} performative class action, emergent tourist {{imagination and}} reconceptualization of crime (Thurlow & Jaworski 2014, Ferrell 2013) in videos by {{and about the}} anti-racketeering Addiopizzo travel tourism movement in Sicily. These videoreportages show traditional touristic urban or rural sites under new angles, moving away from a traditional Grand Tour conception of the Sicilian countryside and monumental highlights, towards coverage about community based tourism entreprises against the madia, such as B&B accommodation or cooperatives producing ethical products, in other, less monumental settings such as confiscated mafia property transformed positively in social projects for bio-agriculture {{as well as in}} in Palermo’s popular shops refusing to pay protection money. Framework - This presentation analyzes the multimodal discourse about Addiopizzo travel as a linguistic window into social innovation (Heller et al. 2014, Cappelli 2013) : both with respect to the genre of the touristic videoreportage about Sicily and through the co-construction of alternative framings of mafia in Sicilian society (Gilliam & Iyengar 2005, Hillahan 2011). The framework is multimodal critical discourse analysis, which studies meaning-making through the combination of linguistic and visual resources in video documentaries (Kress 2010, Jewitt 2013, Bateman & Wildfeuer 2014, Wildfeuer 2014, Hiipala 2016). Context - Addiopizzo arose as a grassroots movement by entrepreneurs refusing to pay extortion money, opposing to the traditional resilience by the Sicilian population fatalistically undergoing intimidation and omertà imposed by Cosa Nostra, another view: the marginalization of Mafia, the emergence of a local responsible economy as a form of public resistance and collective cultural revolution against organized crime (Forno and Gunnarson 2010, Forno 2015, Rubdi & Ben Said 2015). Recently, the movement started acting as a travel organization, extending its focus to consumer strategy in responsible tourism, by means of study trips for schools or informative and leisure excursions for other interested travelers worldwide. The goal of this organization is to show how civil society can oppose organized crime successfully and bring antimafia experience to local and national or global touristic audiences moving beyond proletarian class struggle and involving interclass and transnational contestation and resistance to the mafia (Santino 2008, Rubdy & Ben Said 2015). Corpus and methodology – Our corpus consists of 10 Italian and English travel reportages on YouTube displaying the Addiopizzo travel movement, posted between 2014 and 2017 : the items reach from the group’s own promotion videos to Italian regional or national TV news coverage on regional activist channels or Italy’s national RAI to short European documentaries on British or American TV, and even independent amateur videos by customers (Dunn 2005 a, 2005 b; Francesconi 2015 a, 2015 b). The method used is a functionally oriented corpus-based multimodal analysis (O’Halloran 2008, Bednarek 2015). A central hypothesis is that videodiscourse multimodally displays social relations and tensions between mafia and non-mafia actors and reflects social change performed by antimafia organizations across speech and visual elements in discourse about the mafia and Sicily (Iedema 2003, Di Ronco & Lavorgna 2016). (Expected) results – We provide a classification for the following three discursive strategies used by Addiopizzo Travel in Italian and English. (i) 	We examine genre variation (Francesconi 2014) in the antimafia tourism video reportages defined in terms of their pre-/on-/post-trip <b>travel</b> <b>status,</b> their format, such as TV news coverage, interviews, videoblogs (Azariah 2016) and the like, as well as the institutional source of the video production (the Addiopizzo travel organization itself or traditional national and regional public, private or alternative television stations, as well as individual vlogs). (ii) 	We describe patterns of mediated action remediated interaction, and, possibly co-construction between two types of social actors: Addiopizzo hosts (entrepreneurs and the organization’s representatives) and tourists (Italian and foreign, represented directly (i. e. as they interact during activities or multimodally perform actions) or indirectly (as they are spoken about and mentioned in absence) (Van Leeuwen 1996, Author, Thurlow & Jaworski 2014, Pappalepore & Smith 2016, Forno & Garibaldi 2016). We zoom in on the social movements’s represented actions involving such actors: these are no longer restricted to the mere display of public protest and/or information in a climate of failing direct legal or law enforcement nor as a classical working-class or rural social struggle against mafia hegemony (Santino 2008). In the corpus, they present themselves, instead, as active players in changing their local socio-economic tissue, as they replace traditional schemas of exploitation by new, sustainable educational and economic activities which involve in their activism heterogeneous other interclass civil actors as well as transregional and transnational connections with their hosts in the joint process of production and consumption of the touristic community-based experience. Local activists-hosts and their Italian or foreign clients take part in shared indirect antimafia experiences and preventive activities which eventually lead to co-construction of the touristic destination. (iii) 	We provide an overview of Addiopizzo’s legitimation and justification strategies and framings of social change, as a reversible destiny for the city and its citizens (Schneider & Schneider 2003), which reshuffles more conventional, sometimes fatalistic, romantic and fictional representations of mafia culture, and even straightforward denial of the Mafia’s existence (Jerne 2015, 2016; Di Piazza 2010; Poppi & Di Piazza 2017). Such discursive strategies show clients as they interact with local activists and react to mafia stereotypes during their stay in Italy.   References Azariah, Deepti Ruth (2016).

The essays draw on diverse methodological approaches, from the archival and literary to the art historical and archaeological. The collection focuses not just on key medieval modes of travel and mobility, but also on themes whose relevance continues to resonate in the modern world. Topics touched upon include religious and diplomatic journeys, migration, mobility and governance, gendered mobilities, material culture and mobility, mobility and disability, <b>travel</b> and <b>status,</b> and notions of home and abroad. Broad themes are approached through case studies of individuals, families, and groups, ranging from kings, queens, and nobles to friars, exiles, and students. The geographical reach of the collection is particularly broad, encompassing travellers from Southern, Western, Northern, Central and Eastern Europe and journeys to destinations as diverse as Scandinavia, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean. A wide-ranging and detailed introduction situates the collection in its scholarly context...|$|R
40|$|The article {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on Liszt’s connections with so called Gypsy music, with particular emphasis on the sources and manifestations of the composer’s interest in the subject. The paper also shows the eff ects of Liszt’s thought on his academic successors. Liszt’s fascination with Gypsy music and culture is discussed by outlining his childhood memories as well as indicating numerous personal contacts he had with renowned Gypsy musicians. The author of the paper also links Liszt’s enchantment with Gypsy culture with his readiness to identify his <b>travelling</b> virtuoso <b>status</b> with that of a Gypsy-wanderer. Special attention in the article is put on Liszt’s book Des Bohémiens et de leur musique en Hongrie (1859). The author of the article claims that Liszt’s cosmopolitanism may be a key factor while explaining the composer’s predilection to Gypsy culture and music. While focusing on the reception of Liszt’s views on so called Gypsy music by the posterity Bartók’s interpretation of Liszt’s ideas is reminded. Discussed are also their repercussions {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century and early twenty fi rst century...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year more}} than 45 million Americans travel abroad for work or pleasure, and over 20 million of these travel to rural areas or {{developing}} countries. While the major medical risks of international travel are often exaggerated, the incidence of minor illness is not. Persons going to Asia, Africa, or Latin America for one month run a 65 % to 75 % chance of becoming ill, although only 1 % will require hospitalization. The two most common illnesses that affect travelers, which do have immunizations and are often overlooked by physicians, are influenza and hepatitis A. The risk of illness to the traveler varies by health and age status, by the region to be visited, {{by the time of}} year, and by the length of the journey. Immunization advice for the traveler, therefore, is complicated and is best approached in a systematic manner. This article outlines six steps to sound immunization advice. These steps include ascertaining the traveler's special individual needs, routine immunization <b>status,</b> and routine <b>travel</b> immunization <b>status,</b> as well as the entry requirements for the country to be visited, geographically indicated vaccines, and immunizations as indicated for extended stays abroad...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s China’s {{government}} has negotiated Approved Destination Status (ADS) with 120 countries. The agreements allow government-approved travel agencies to market group tours and obtain visas in bulk to ADS destinations. We apply a gravity model framework to analyze how ADS has affected Chinese outbound tourist travel from China using Chinese visitor arrivals data from 61 main foreign destinations of mainland Chinese tourists (which account for {{vast majority of}} international departures from China) from 1995 to 2005. Fixed effects estimates indicate ADS resulted in significant increases in arrivals from China (averaging 52 percent over three years). We also find evidence of travel diversion as more countries received ADS.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has found that in some cases travel time variance is more important than mean travel time in travel mode choice. This implies shared infrastructure transportation modes prone to service unreliability stand at a disadvantage even if they are on average faster than automobile <b>travel.</b> Real-time <b>status</b> and historical availability statistics gleaned from vehicle instrumentation provide a natural complement to such systems, reducing travel uncertainty without the infrastructural investment normally required to increase reliability. I present two projects that explore the idea that a web-work of data-producing shared infrastructure joined by user-facing traveler information systems comprise an aggregate transportation mode competitive with automobile transit. The first, WideWorld, is a multimodal trip planner incorporating real time bicycle share availability. The second, Bus Buzzard draws on millions of bus GPS fixes to generate probabilistic bus schedules in some cases more reliable than printed schedules. by Brandon Martin-Anderson. Thesis: S.

40|$|Using {{data from}} i) a self-administered survey of 673 older female drivers, and ii) a case-control study of 48 crash-involved and 44 non crash-involved older female drivers, some {{factors that may}} predict crash {{involvement}} were identified. Survey data gathered self-reported information on demographic characteristics, health <b>status,</b> <b>travel</b> patterns and driving practices. A battery of functional performance assessments were administered by trained experimenters in the case-control study, and participants completed a second detailed self-administered questionnaire. Factors found to predict crash involvement included driving characteristics such as being the main driver in the household, not highly confident of being a safe driver, experiencing difficulty driving in unfamiliar areas and having problems with the driving style of other drivers. In addition, low attentional, cognitive and motor skills and presence of multiple medical conditions were significant predictors of crash involvement...|$|R
30|$|There are {{interesting}} conceptual {{discussions about the}} language {{used to refer to}} policies that illegalise people (see, De Genova, 2002, for details). Generally speaking, migrants could be identified as irregular at two stages. One, through {{the ways in which they}} cross internationally recognised borders (i.e. without authorisation) and two, the ways in which they work and stay in a destination country (i.e. violating immigration laws). This points to the importance of distinguishing between irregularity in <b>travel,</b> and legal <b>status</b> on arrival. During travel, it matters regarding cost, debt, duration of travel, risks of migration, etc. At the place of destination, “illegal” status affects the way and patterns of remittance flows. However, the dichotomy between - regular and irregular or legal and illegal migration - is often criticised by many scholars, as the status of immigrants can change from one category to the other too easily and quickly (Castles et al., 2014).|$|R
30|$|Haitian farmers became {{eligible}} for the survey sample because (1) they were members of two established agricultural cooperatives that were known to field workers at the Port-au-Prince office of the International Organization for Migration, (2) they were selected by the leadership of those cooperatives {{to be among the}} initial participants in the program, and (3) their households were available to be interviewed May 23 – 27, 2016. This triple selection creates the potential for surveyed workers to be substantially different from typical Haitian farmers, which could affect the external validity of the evaluation results. We have less concern about selection affecting the internal validity of the impact evaluation, given that the survey sample includes 12 of the 14 households that had a member travel in 2015, and {{the fact that many of}} the eligible households whose members did not <b>travel</b> acquired this <b>status</b> due to a force majeure outside their control.|$|R
40|$|Panel 3 at the Travelling Lines, TrAIN conference. Drawing {{is enjoying}} a renaissance – in art education, art practice, curating and research. Drawing {{is on the}} move: while still subsidiary, it has become {{established}} as an autonomous art with a primary <b>status.</b> <b>Travelling</b> Lines brings together scholars, artists, curators and collectors to create an international forum to consider three key themes: itinerant modes of drawing by Latin America based artists that prioritise investigation and exploration, as line travels off the page {{and out of the}} studio into the environment; how the nomadic practices of artists necessitate conceptual and low-key strategies associated with drawing, an especially portable medium; and how itinerant and other modes of drawing circulate within the transnational circuits of the globalised art world. Focusing on one medium, speakers address how visual languages participate in, depend on, and travel across local as well as global territories.

40|$|Geotourism {{is a new}} phenomenon, {{which has}} emerged in the tourism {{literature}} {{during the past two}} decades, and whose meaning suffered from global census. Geotourism is still a new discipline and relatively little has been written about its demand side, demonstrated by a lack of studies in the literature This article studies the recreational value of geotourism areas, and focuses on the first geopark in the Czech Republic, namely the Czech Paradise Geopark. To assess the recreational value the travel cost method is applied, specifically the individual travel cost model. The necessary research data was gathered through intensive tourist surveys conducted in the study area. Data gathered in the respondents’ survey served to determine the consumer surplus as a measure of recreational value and to develop the single site travel cost model. The dependent variable in the conducted model is the number of visits in the area and among the independent variables, studied age, education, <b>travel</b> cost, family <b>status,</b> economic activity and income. The results were subsequently compared to findings in the available literature, research works and case studies...|$|R
