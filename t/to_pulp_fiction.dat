2500|$|The {{combination}} of visuals and music with {{the setting of}} the criminal underworld has drawn comparisons <b>to</b> <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fiction</b> and the films of Quentin Tarantino, that had spawned a certain type of [...] "90s indie cinema" [...] which [...] "strove to dazzle the viewer with self-conscious cleverness and empty shock tactics".

[...] Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than <b>to</b> <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fiction</b> itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that [...] "the way that [...] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming." [...] Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The fact that Pulp Fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful— namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand." [...] Observing in the National Review that [...] "o film arrives with more advance hype", John Simon was unswayed: [...] "titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness".|$|E

Artists like Mel Hunter had extensive training in scientific and technical illustration, and a broad knowledge of space technologies.

40|$|Reading the Street" {{chronicles the}} rise of black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> in the post-civil rights era from the {{perspective}} of its urban readership. Black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> was originally published in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s; it consisted of paperback novels about tough male characters navigating the pitfalls of urban life. These novels appealed mainly to inner-city readers who felt left out of civil rights' and Black Power's promises of social equality. Despite the historic achievements of the civil rights movement, entrenched structural inequalities led to America's ghettos becoming sites of concentrated poverty, rampant unemployment, and violent crime. While mainstream society seemed to {{turn a blind eye to}} how these problems were destroying inner-city communities, readers turned <b>to</b> black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> for the imaginative resources that would help them reflect on their social reality. In black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction,</b> readers found confirmation that America was not on the path toward extending equal opportunities to its most vulnerable citizens, or that {{the rise of}} Black Power signaled a change in their fortunes. Yet in black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> readers also found confirmation that their lives as marginalized subjects possessed a value of its own, and that their day-to-day struggles opened up new ways of "being black" amid the blight of the inner city.
