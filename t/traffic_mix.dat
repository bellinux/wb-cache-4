40|$|Abstract — In timing {{analysis}} attackers study the transmission pattern of different nodes {{in a network}} {{with the goal of}} extracting information about users, applications, or the structure of the network, even when the traffic is encrypted. Defeating {{timing analysis}} attacks requires expensive <b>traffic</b> <b>mixing</b> measures that equalize the transmission pattern at all nodes; such measures are especially expensive for battery operated wireless devices. In this paper, we first introduce TARP, a <b>traffic</b> <b>mixing</b> approach for defeating timing analysis tailored towards sensor networks. While TARP improves on <b>traffic</b> <b>mixing</b> approaches by combining mul-tiple packets destined to different destinations in a single frame (amortizing packet overhead), <b>traffic</b> <b>mixing</b> remains expensive. To this end, we propose two techniques for improving the energy efficiency of TARP: (1) Using multi-path routing to exploit the available capacity engineered to defeat timing analysis; and (2) Adaptive transmission control to allow the transmission pattern to be adapted to the offered load without exposing the structure of the network. Furthermore, we define and explore the notion of relaxed timing analysis resilience where resilience is provided with a limited scope that is well defined in space and/or time. By controlling the scope to fit the application requirements, substantial savings in energy (or delay) can be achieved, while retaining desired levels of timing analysis resilience. Together, the proposed techniques significantly reduce the overhead of TARP, making timing analysis resilience more affordable for critical applications. I...|$|R
30|$|In this section, a {{methodology}} is developed for simulation of <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. <b>Mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> flow is considered when speed differential among {{different types of}} vehicles is quite substantial and the desired number of overtaking increases with limited opportunities to overtake [18]. Mehar et al. [19] define as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions when there are several categories of vehicles sharing and moving on same carriageway width without any physical segregation between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, and without proper lane discipline. Due to the wide variations in physical dimensions and speeds of various vehicles, {{it is difficult to}} impose lane discipline. The vehicles occupy any available lateral position on the road space, while the small vehicles, such as motor cycles often utilize gaps between larger vehicles in the <b>traffic</b> stream. In <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, there are different combinations of vehicles for leader-follower pairs [3].|$|R

Depending {{on the data}} and voice <b>traffic</b> <b>mix</b> that must be carried, {{there can be a}} large amount of unused bandwidth left over, due to the fixed sizes of concatenated containers.

More important is the need for all intermediate network elements to support newly introduced concatenation sizes. This problem was overcome with the introduction of Virtual Concatenation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gray system theory-based method for the quantitative evaluation and ranking of the operational and safety performance of signalized intersections {{in urban areas}} under <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. <b>Mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions refer to traffic situations in which motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians share a signalized intersection. Such <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> is a typical phenomenon in many cities {{around the world in}} which the populations of urban areas are extremely large. Five index parameters are used in the proposed method: the degree of saturation, the average stopped delay, the queue length, the conflict ratio, and the separation ratio. These parameters represent the operational and safety performance of a signalized intersection with <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> They are inputted into the evaluation equations, which are developed according to the gray system theory. The method is applied to the performance evaluation of the intersections and network in the urban area of Changsha, China. the results show that the method can be used to conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation and ranking of signalized intersections under the <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions that are associated with urban road network systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] We {{consider}} {{problems in}} traffic integration and routing for virtual path (VP) -based multiservice networks. The {{objective is to}} exploit statistical multiplexing among various traffic types {{in order to improve}} system utilization. Difficulties arise due to statistical multiplexing since a connection's bandwidth require-ment depends on the characteristics of the interfering traffic. We first consider whether segregating heterogeneous traffic with different quality of service (QoS) requirements on separate VP's is desirable. Next we consider routing heterogeneous permanent connections given a predefined traffic type mix onto multiple VP's between a source destination pair. We show that it is not necessarily advantageous to have each VP carry every traffic type. In fact, perhaps surprisingly, an optimum solution to this problem suggests that {{only a small number of}} traffic types, or even homogeneous traffic, need be present on each VP. Based on this observation, we propose a simple alternative routing algorithm with routing sequences depending on the <b>traffic</b> <b>mix.</b> Index Terms [...] Alternative routing, statistical multiplexing, <b>traffic</b> <b>mix,</b> virtual path.
