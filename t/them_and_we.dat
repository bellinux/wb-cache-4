She says, “I think we should go. It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E
25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were {{having a lot of}} fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will try next year."

500|$|Berkman {{encouraged}} Diener and Boxenbaum {{to fly out}} to Los Angeles {{to watch}} a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a [...] "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, {{so he could be}} the star I perceived him to be." [...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{praised the}} film in his review saying, [...] "The Prince of Egypt {{is one of the}} best-looking {{animated}} films ever made. It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> sense the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the thrill of the chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children's entertainment." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave a negative review of the film saying, [...] "The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy." [...] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post praised the film saying, [...] "The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable." ...|$|E

500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 53rd Grammy Awards, held in February 2011, {{band members}} Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood {{said in a}} {{backstage}} interview that work on the group's third album was almost complete. On May 2, 2011, the band [...] digitally released [...] "Just a Kiss", the lead single from the new project. In a blog entry on their website, the group said that [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] was among the last songs that were written for the album. Haywood commented, [...] "We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea, so we sat down to write it." [...] Hillary Scott, Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson. Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country: [...] "I {{went out on the}} road with <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> wrote a couple of things. We recorded one song called 'We Own the Night'. Charles called me as they were about done with the record. He said, 'Man, we want to write again.' So the band came over [...] one morning.

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

500|$|African Americans pioneered rural {{settlements}} in the state throughout {{the first half of}} the nineteenth-century. Although Indiana entered the Union in 1816 as a free state it gave only a tepid welcome to African Americans and frequently sought to exclude and/or marginalize African Americans from public and social life. African Americans faced discrimination on a variety of fronts. Blacks were denied the right to testify in court in 1818. In 1829 the Indiana Colonization Society was founded to help repatriate African Americans to Liberia which reflected a desire to rid the state of its black residents. [...] The 1830 census recorded three slaves in the state. The earliest days of the territory and of statehood witnessed intense debates over whether to allow slavery in Indiana. Laws in the 1830s sought to prevent free blacks from entering the state without certificates of freedom under threat of fines and expulsion. [...] While the 1830 law was only sporadically enforced it reflected hostility towards African Americans and their settlement in the state. Throughout the early nineteenth century, Black Hoosiers struggled to enjoy basic civil rights in the state, including the right to educate their children. In 1837 and 1841 the state shifted towards formally excluding African Americans from public education. In 1837 the state legislature moved to recognize [...] "The white inhabitants of each congressional district" [...] as the citizens qualified to vote in school board elections. Four years later, they followed with an effort to preclude black households from school board assessments. This helped to establish Hoosier schools as de facto white. Efforts in 1842 to formally exclude African American children from public education were rebuffed, however. The State Committee on Education responded to the matter acknowledging that they [...] "...Are here, unfortunately, for us and <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have duties to perform in reference to their well-being." [...] Indiana also passed laws against interracial marriage in 1818 and 1821. Under 1840 state laws to ban miscegenation Indiana became the first state to make interracial marriage a felony. [...] Article XIII of the Indiana Constitution of 1851 sought to exclude African Americans from settling in the state, declaring [...] "No negro or mulatto shall come into or settle in the State." [...] This was the only provision of the new constitution submitted to a special election. Indiana constitutional convention delegates voted 93 to 40 in favor of the article. The popular vote was even more enthusiastic in its support for exclusion with a vote of 113,828 in favor and only 21,873 against excluding African Americans. [...] Throughout {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, Indiana attempted to keep Black Hoosiers from attending public school, voting, testifying in court, and endeavored to set other limits on African American citizenship and inclusion. Racial hostility and discrimination co-existed alongside abolition sentiments and efforts, however. The Underground Railroad in Indiana sought to help runaway slaves escape to northern states and Canada. White Quakers, Baptists, and others worked to secure safe passage for runaway slaves. Abolition efforts conflicted with a growing antipathy towards free blacks in the state.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2009, Marshall, Mike Hall and Colin Harris {{founded the}} Merseyside Skeptics Society.

In opening the case, Ghica stated: [...] "It wasn't just us who condemned those ministers, but public opinion in general, the entire country, cast a blame on <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are the expression of that blame". The effort pitted Pantazi Ghica against his main literary rival, outgoing Education Minister Titu Maiorescu, who was called in for questioning.
