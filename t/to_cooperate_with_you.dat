[...] "The voting results are {{evidence}} of the wide recognition of your personal merits as a prime minister and of the real achievements {{that have been made}} in the social and economic areas of the Turkish Republic. I would particularly like to highlight the major contribution that you and your party have been making to strengthening partner relations between our countries. For its part, Russia is ready and willing <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> closely <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> further promote mutually beneficial partnership. From the very bottom of my heart, I wish you health and happiness, and new achievements and victories to the Justice and Development Party" [...] he said. President Dmitry Medvedev also congratulated Erdogan on his party's victory. According to the Russian President, Russian-Turkish relations during the AKP's rule were developing successfully and the Kremlin looks forward <b>to</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>with</b> the Turkish authorities in various fields.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of social interactions such as the prisoner's dilemma is trust. Your likelihood of <b>cooperating</b> <b>with</b> another individual {{is directly related to}} how much <b>you</b> trust them <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> you; if <b>you</b> expect the other individual to defect against you, {{there is no reason for}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> them. Trust behavior seems to be related to the presence of oxytocin, a hormone involved in maternal behavior and pair bonding in many species. When oxytocin levels were increased in humans, they were more trusting of other individuals than a control group even though their overall levels of risk-taking were unaffected suggesting that oxytocin is specifically implicated in the social aspects of risk taking.|$|R
40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) is {{the ability}} to {{attribute}} mental states (e. g., beliefs and desires) to other people in order to understand and predict their behaviour. If others are rewarded <b>to</b> compete or <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> then what they will do depends upon what they believe about you. This is the reason why social interaction induces recursive ToM, of the sort "I think that you think that I think, etc. ". Critically, recursion is the common notion behind the definition of sophistication of human language, strategic thinking in games, and, arguably, ToM. Although sophisticated ToM is believed to have high adaptive fitness, broad experimental evidence from behavioural economics, experimental psychology and linguistics point towards limited recursivity in representing other's beliefs. In this work, we test whether such apparent limitation may not in fact be proven to be adaptive, i. e. optimal in an evolutionary sense. First, we propose a meta-Bayesian approach that can predict the behaviour of ToM sophistication phenotypes who engage in social interactions. Second, we measure their adaptive fitness using evolutionary game theory. Our main contribution is to show that one does not have to appeal to biological costs to explain our limited ToM sophistication. In fact, the evolutionary cost/benefit ratio of ToM sophistication is non trivial. This is partly because an informational cost prevents highly sophisticated ToM phenotypes to fully exploit less sophisticated ones (in a competitive context). In addition, cooperation surprisingly favours lower levels of ToM sophistication. Taken together, these quantitative corollaries of the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis provide an evolutionary account for both the limitation of ToM sophistication in humans as well as the persistence of low ToM sophistication levels...|$|R

40|$|Past {{qualitative}} {{research has shown}} that fear of retaliation influences an individual 2 ̆ 7 s willingness <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> the police. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively examine the influence that fear of retaliation has on a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s willingness <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> the police. This study also examined both normative and instrumental motivations for <b>cooperating</b> <b>with</b> the police <b>to</b> understand which motivations are more salient at explaining willingness <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> the police. Data for this study were collected from 408 Detroit homes in 2009 from three different neighborhoods where homes were selected randomly from those neighborhoods. Results indicate that the instrumental motivation, fear of retaliation, influences an individual 2 ̆ 7 s willingness <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> the police. However, even more salient was the normative motivation, trust in the police, which showed that citizens who are more trustful of the police will be more willing <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> them...|$|R
40|$|Research {{consistently}} {{reveals that}} public perceptions of procedural justice and police performance {{are important for}} fostering citizens’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> police, with procedural justice being more important than police performance.

Of particular interest will be how people’s affiliations with different groups in society moderate their responses to questions about their willingness <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> police. The study utilizes survey data from 10, 148 Australian residents and demonstrates that procedural justice, police performance, and identity each predict people’s intentions <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> police. The findings also reveal that identity can moderate citizens’ concerns about procedural justice and police performance when predicting cooperation...|$|R
