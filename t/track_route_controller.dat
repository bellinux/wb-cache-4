50|$|Services may be {{strictly}} regulated {{in terms of}} level of adherence to timetables, and how often timetables may be changed. Operators and authorities may employ on street bus inspectors to monitor adherence in real time. Service operators often have a control room, {{or in the case}} of large operations, <b>route</b> <b>controllers,</b> who can monitor the level of service on routes and can take remedial action if problems occur. This was made easier with the technological advances of two way radio contact with drivers, and vehicle tracking systems.|$|R
40|$|Multihomed {{subscribers}} {{are increasingly}} adopting intelligent route control solutions {{to optimize the}} cost and end-to-end performance of the traffic routed among the different links connecting their networks to the Internet. Until recently, IRC practices were not considered adverse, but new studies show that in a competitive environment, they can lead to persistent traffic oscillations, causing significant performance degradation rather than improvements. To cope with this, randomized IRC techniques were proposed. However, the proliferation of IRC products raises concerns, given that randomization becomes less effective {{as the number of}} interfering IRC systems increases. In this article, we present a more scalable route control strategy that can better support the foreseeable spread of IRC solutions. We show that by blending randomization with adaptive filtering techniques, it is possible to drastically reduce the interference between competing <b>route</b> <b>controllers,</b> and this can be achieved without penalizing the end-to-end traffic performance. In addition to the potential improvements in terms of scalability and performance, the route control strategy outlined here has various practical advantages. For instance, it does not require any kind of protocol or coordination between the competing IRC middleboxes, and it can be adopted readily today because the only requirement is a software upgrade of the available <b>route</b> <b>controllers.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R

5000|$|Non-revenue track (or trackage), or a non-revenue route, is {{a section}} of <b>track</b> or {{transport}} <b>route</b> that is not used to carry passengers or revenue-earning freight or goods. [...] The term is used to refer mainly to sections of <b>track</b> or <b>routes</b> in public transport systems, such as rapid transit and tramway networks, but non-revenue <b>track</b> or <b>routes</b> {{can also be found}} in other transport systems. Non-revenue tracks may be used for revenue service during temporary reroutings.|$|R
5000|$|Mandatory {{frequency}} {{airports are}} {{rare in the}} United States, one example being Ketchikan International Airport (...) , but they are common in other countries such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Norway; often, an MF or MTAF airport is one with scheduled passenger service but insufficient traffic to support a control tower. If there is a flight service specialist monitoring the frequency, the specialist will give pilots advisories about traffic, weather, and surface conditions, and may relay IFR clearances from en <b>route</b> <b>controllers,</b> but cannot give clearances him- or herself.|$|R

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{techniques have}} been used to study and evaluate the potential of hybrid locomotive applications. The Longitudinal Train Simulation (CRE-LTS) software package at Centre for Railway Engineering, CQUniversity, Australia has been used to conduct the energy usage analysis for the heavy haul operations on two typical <b>track</b> <b>routes</b> in Australia. The simulation results showed that the energy generated and dissipated from dynamic braking can be up to ~ 30 % of the locomotive traction energy usage for the <b>track</b> <b>routes</b> and train configurations analysed. The further analysis showed that the locomotives operate at an average power of much less than 100 % full power, and an energy hybridisation potential factor was defined. The maximum energy hybridisation potential factor was calculated at 63. 4 %. There is potential for heavy haul hybrid locomotive applications if cost effective technologies are available...|$|R
