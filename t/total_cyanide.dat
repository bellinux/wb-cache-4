The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and <b>total</b> <b>cyanide</b> respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{processing}} cassava to remove cyanogens consist of sun drying and heap fermentation in East Africa, which are inadequate in removal of cyanogens {{even in a}} year of normal rainfall. In Central Africa soaking (retting) of cassava roots in water for 4-5 days is adequate, but short soaking for 1-2 days leaves large amounts of cyanogens in flour and leads to konzo. In West Africa a roasted product called gari is produced by a different method than that used to produce flour, which reduces the <b>total</b> <b>cyanide</b> content to 10-20 ppm. There are no reported cases of konzo west of Cameroon. However another neurological disease called tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN), occurs amongst older people in south-west Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, West Indies and South India, and is probably due to long term intake of cyanogens from cassava at a lower level than that needed to cause konzo.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen cyanide release during {{feeding of}} generalist and {{specialist}} lepidopteran larvae on a cyanogenic plant, Passiflora capsularis. (Alonso Amelot, Miguel; Avila Nuñez, Jorge Luis; Duarte, Lisday y Oliveros Bastidas, Alberto) Abstract The hydrogen cyanide-based interaction of a strongly cyanogenic plant, Passiflora capsularis, and larvae of two insect herbivores, a generalist (Spodoptera frugiperda) and a specialist (Heliconius erato), is examined {{in terms of}} the combined kinetics of the feeding process and the simultaneous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) liberation, as compared with the natural kinetics of hydrogen cyanide evolution by plant-leaf tissue. There are marked differences in acceptance of P. capsularis by third-instar larvae of specialist and generalist species. The former, H. erato, display a parsimonious ingestion rate of 0. 74 ± 0. 15 mg (fresh weight) min- 1 comprising 18 % active feeding time, whereas S. frugiperda larvae show a more erratic and restrained feeding involving 4 % of the time at 0. 45 ± 0. 14 mg min- 1. These S. frugiperda larvae ingest 124. 4 ± 8. 3 mg (fw) of the non-cyanogeneic Spinacia oleracea leaves in 24 h compared with only 74. 7 ± 20. 1 mg of P. capsularis in the same period. The <b>total</b> hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> released naturally from wild specimens of P. capsularis plants is in the range 326 - 3901 µ g g- 1. Hydrogen cyanide evo lution from macerated P. capsularis leaves takes place along a hyperbolic function with time and initial velocities of cyanide evolution are a linear function of <b>total</b> hydrogen <b>cyanide.</b> When feeding on P. capsularis leaves, H. erato releases only a minor fraction relative to <b>total</b> hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> (0. 09 %) and to the anticipated cyanide from the initial velocity (7 %). By contrast, S. frugiperda evokes 5. 8 -fold more than the anticipated hydrogen cyanide release from the plant.

Results show radionuclide concentrations at or below previous (pre-fire) maximum levels at locations on LANL and downstream. However, greater concentrations of some fallout-associated radionuclides (cesium- 137 and strontium- 90) were seen arriving on LANL from upstream areas compared to pre-fire conditions. Tests indicate most of the radionuclides in the samples were bound to sediments, not dissolved in water. Most radionuclide concentrations in sediments were below LANL Screening Action Levels, with cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 as exceptions. Most radionuclide concentrations in samples taken at LANL's downstream boundary were greater than those taken upstream, indicating the presence of contributing sources on LANL.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cyanide {{has been}} listed {{as one of}} the toxic {{pollutants}} that is usually released into the environment. Cyanide is said to be released during the processing of cyanogenic plant parts which tobacco plant is one of them. This work determines the concentration of <b>total</b> <b>cyanide</b> in waste water collected in and around a tobacco company. Distillation was carried out followed by spectrophotometric analysis with pyridine-barbituric acid as the colour forming reagent and absorbance was measured at 578 nm using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The result revealed <b>total</b> <b>cyanide</b> in each sample as follows (mg/l) : 0. 641 + 0. 004, 0. 443 + 0. 007, 0. 319 + 0. 007, 0. 184 + 0. 001 and 0. 403 + 0. 004, for untreated wastewater sample, treated waste water sample from the factory, Lake water sample beside the factory where the effluent is released, upstream and downstream of a river located about 1 km away from the factory, respectively. Highest value was recorded for sample collected from down-stream of the river while, sample collected from the upstream have the minimum level. The levels are significantly higher than the maximum permissible levels recommended by WHO (0. 2 mg/l), European Union and National Agency for Food, Drugs and Administration Control (NAFDAC) (0. 001 mg/l) at P= 0. 05. Based on these findings, water from the lake and river beside the factory may not be good for drinking...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{work done}} in characterizing {{a number of important}} atmospheric trace gas species. There are two main components to this thesis. The first describes a 3 year measurement campaign of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, carbonyl sulfide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> and formaldehyde <b>total</b> column amounts over Wollongong, in New South Wales, Australia (34. 4 °S, 150. 9 °E). The measurements were made by the examination of the intensity of characteristic absorption features observed in infrared spectra obtained by ground-based solar spectrometry. Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>total</b> column amounts increased over the campaign whilst a decrease was observed for carbon monoxide and formaldehyde. A larger than expected decrease in the carbonyl sulfide total column was also observed. The second part of the thesis describes the investigation of the above methods suitability as a possible measurement tool for trace gases in the remote marine boundary layer. Spectra were collected at solar zenith angles greater than 90 o above the marine horizon on 4 days. Enhanced absorption features were observed for a large number of species and a spectral region for the possible observation of hypochlorous acid was identified. The experimental setup allowed for transmission of some infrared radiation but not enough to generate a sufficient signal to noise ratio for meaningful calculations to be made. Almost all absorption features were partially saturated or had low signal to noise. Despite these problems, some simple changes to the experimental setup may prove this to be a useful method with preliminary calculations indicating high information content for the marine boundary layer in solar spectra observed at zenith angles greater the 88 o with signal to noise ratios of 100. The use of narrower optical band filters for the collection of the dawn spectra is recommended in a bid to increase the signal to noise ratio required for meaningful observations of the marine boundary layer to be made...|$|R
40|$|A Saltstone waste {{form was}} {{prepared}} in the Savannah River National Laboratory from a Tank 50 H sample and Z-Area premix {{material for the}} first quarter of calendar year 2008 (1 QCY 08). After the prescribed 28 day cure, samples of the saltstone were collected, and the waste form was shown to meet the South Carolina Hazardous Waste Management Regulations (SCHWMR) R. 61 - 79. 261. 24 and R. 61 - 79. 268. 48 (a) requirements for a nonhazardous waste form with respect to RCRA metals and underlying hazardous constituents. These analyses met all quality assurance specifications of USEPA SW- 846. The Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) receives waste from Tank 50 H for treatment. In {{the first quarter of the}} 2008 calendar year (1 QCY 08), in addition to Effluent Treatment Project (ETP) waste that is regularly added at approximately 10 kgal/month, Tank 50 H received significant waste transfers from Tank 23 H and from Tank 49 H. The Saltstone Grout Sampling plan provides the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) with the chemical and physical characterization strategy for the salt solution which is to be disposed of in the Z-Area Solid Waste Landfill (ISWLF). During operation, samples were collected from Tank 50 H and grout samples prepared to determine the non-hazardous nature of the grout to meet the requirements of the South Carolina Hazardous Waste Management Regulations (SCHWMR) R. 61 - 79. 261. 24 (b) and R. 61 - 79. 268. 48 (a). SRNL was asked to prepare saltstone from a sample of Tank 50 H obtained during 1 QCY 08 processing to determine the non-hazardous nature of the grout. The samples were cured and shipped to Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Group-Radioisotope and Analytical Chemistry Laboratory (B&WTSGRACL) to perform the Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and subsequent extract analysis on saltstone samples for the analytes required for the quarterly analysis saltstone sample. In addition to the eight toxic metals-arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, lead, selenium and silver-analytes included the underlying hazardous constituents (UHC) antimony, beryllium, nickel, and thallium which could not be eliminated from analysis by process knowledge. B&WTSG-RACL provided subsamples to GEL Laboratories, LLC for analysis for the UHCs benzene, phenols and <b>total</b> and amenable <b>cyanide...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} effort {{focused on}} evaluating the toxicity of the saline waste water generated from washing of Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) deicing trucks and {{to study the}} feasibility of discharging it into wastewater treatment plants. Performance of activated sludge treating wastewater under varying levels of salt concentration was studied by measuring the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), activated sludge oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and Turbidity. For the COD tests, wastewater was tested with salt concentrations ranging from 0 mg/L – 1500 mg/L. Within this range there is no impact of salt on COD stabilization, suggesting that the microorganisms are not adversely impacted by salinity in this range. Turbidity tests were conducted for salt concentrations of 0 - 10, 000 mg/L. Below a concentration of 3000 mg/ L salt {{did not have any}} significant impact on the turbidity. Concentrations above 3000 mg/L aided in flocculation of particles and resulted in faster settling of colloidal solids and reduction in turbidity. Another component {{of the study was to}} examine the fate and chemistry of ferric ferro/ferri cyanide, an anti-caking complex that is added to deicing salt. Although, the complex form of cyanide is harmless, in the presence of sunlight it can dissociate to form free cyanide that is highly toxic. Deicing salts collected from INDOT’s West Lafayette and Lafayette Facilities were tested for <b>total</b> and amenable <b>cyanide</b> levels. Lafayette road salt had high levels of cyanide that could lead to violation of pretreatment standards on cyanide, if this salt wash water is discharged to wastewater treatment plant. Respirometry was used for the impact assessment of variable salt concentrations on the biological performance of a low strength activated sludge samples for a POTW using a static liquid – gas flow (GFS) respirometer with salt concentrations varying from 0 – 10 %. Generally, positive effect in oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was noticed on low salt concentrations up to 2 % and a sharp decrease thereafter. A salt concentration of 6 % resulted in a 50 % decrease in respiration rate of the tested activated sludge. Further studies should involve the effect of saline shock loads in the specific ammonia uptake rate (SAUR) and specific nitrate uptake rate (SNUR) in addition to the final effluent quality...|$|R
