2500|$|The first fully {{operational}} MC-130H Combat Talon II (87-0024) was {{received by the}} 8th SOS on June 29, 1991, with three others delivered over the summer. The official acceptance ceremony for the Talon II was held at Hurlburt in October, and by December 1991 the 8th SOS was equipped with six. The Combat Talon II features a stronger airframe and modifications to the rear and aft cargo doors. The electronics suite has been upgraded, and includes Global Positioning System navigation, special radars for navigating in adverse weather, and night vision goggles (NVG) capability. These new <b>technologies</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> Combat Talon II to fly as low as [...] above ground level (AGL) in inclement weather, and make faster, more accurate airdrops. The MC-130H Combat Talon II, like the MC-130E Combat Talon I, can perform a variety of mission profiles, from daytime mid-level overwater flight and Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) personnel airdrop to night-time adverse weather terrain-following flight in mountainous terrain supporting airdrop and airland to covert and clandestine objectives. [...] However, the MC-103H is ideally suited for a high to mid-level, daytime VMC overwater run-in to an easily identifiable dropzone, typically a runway, culminating in a JMD airdrop. [...] The MC-130H’s weight, speed, and fuel capacity preclude it from being a viable asset for performing {{any other type of}} tactical mission. [...] Increases in automation reduced the aircrew by two and allowed the Combat Talon II to carry an additional pallet of cargo when compared to the Combat Talon I. Initial Operational capability was reached on June 30, 1993.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} methods are used to attach an RF module to a printed circuit board, either with {{through-hole}} technology or surface-mount <b>technology.</b> Through-hole <b>technology</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> module to be inserted or removed without soldering. Surface-mount <b>technology</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> module to {{be attached to the}} PCB without an additional assembly step. Surface-mount connections used in RF modules include land grid array (LGA) and Castellated Holes. <b>The</b> LGA package <b>allows</b> for small module sizes as the pads are all beneath the module but connections must be X-rayed to verify connectivity. Castellated Holes enable optical inspection of the connection but will make the module footprint physically larger to accommodate the pads.|$|R

5000|$|Donnarumma gained {{international}} recognition {{with a series}} of works focused on the interaction between human body, sound and technology, including Music for Flesh II (2011), Hypo Chrysos (2012), Ominous (2012), Nigredo (2013), 0-Infinity (2015) and Corpus Nil (2016). Key to these works is the new kind of human-computer interaction afforded by the XTH Sense and the other technologies developed by the artist himself, such as interactive algorithms, artificial intelligence software and psychoacoustic systems. These custom <b>technologies</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> artist to use the human body as an instrument by amplifying human bodily sounds and capturing physiological and corporeal activity.|$|E
50|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (or high-throughput sequencing) {{came about}} {{due to the}} ever-increasing demand for low-cost sequencing. These sequencing <b>technologies</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently. The large amount of sequence data available has created the field of genomics, research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms. Genomics {{can also be considered}} a subfield of bioinformatics, which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of biological data. A common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and personally identifiable information. See also genomics data sharing.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the E911 challenges inherent to IP phone systems, specialized technology has been developed to locate callers {{in the case of}} emergency. Some of these new <b>technologies</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> caller to be located down to the specific office on a particular floor of a building. These solutions support a wide range of organizations with IP telephony networks. The solutions are available for service providers offering hosted IP-PBX and residential VoIP services. This increasingly important segment in IP phone technology includes E911 call routing services and automated phone tracking appliances. Many of these solutions have been established according to FCC, CRTC, and NENA i2 standards, in order to help enterprises and service providers reduce liability concerns and meet E911 regulations.|$|E
