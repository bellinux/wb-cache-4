The model assumes that the measured noise spectra are due uniquely to the unsteady component of combustion heat release. The model was applied to a long cylindrical hydrogen burner operating over a range of power levels between 4. 5 kW and 22. 3 kW. Acoustic impedances at the inlet to the burner and at the exit of the tube downstream of the burner were measured and are used as boundary conditions for the model.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for deducing the thermal-acoustic efficiency spectrum (defined as {{the fraction of}} combustion heat release converted to acoustic energy at a given frequency) of a long <b>turbulent</b> <b>burner</b> from the sound spectrum measured in the far field. The method, {{which is based on}} a one-dimensional model of the unsteady flow in the burner, is applied to a tubular diffusion-flame hydrogen burner whose length is large compared to its diameter. The results for thermal powers ranging from 4. 5 to 22. 3 kW show that the thermal-acoustic efficiency is relatively insensitive to the burner power level, decreasing from a value of around 0. 0001 at 150 Hz with a slope of about 20 dB per decade. Evidence is presented indicating that acoustic agitation of the flame below 500 Hz, especially in the neighborhood of the resonant frequencies of the burner, is a significant acoustic source...|$|E

An acoustic source/propagation model is used based on the perturbation solution of the equations describing the unsteady one-dimensional flow of an inviscid ideal gas with a distributed heat source. The technique is applied to a long cylindrical hydrogen-flame burner operating over power levels of 4. 5 - 22. 3 kW. The {{results show that the}} thermal-acoustic efficiency at a given frequency, defined as the fraction of the total burner power converted to acoustic energy at that frequency, is rather insensitive to burner power, having a maximum value on the order of 10 to the - 4 th at 150 Hz and rolling off steeply with increasing frequency. Evidence is presented that acoustic agitation of the flame at low frequencies enhances the mixing of the unburned fuel and air with the hot products of combustion. The paper establishes the potential of the technique as a useful tool for characterizing the acoustic source structure in any burner, such as a gas turbine combustor, for which a reasonable acoustic propagation model can be postulated...|$|E

40|$|A {{technology}} assessment and design improvement effort was undertaken for the Stirling engine heat pump external heat system (EHS) {{in order to}} reduce costs. It was found that only two applicable EHS design approaches have been developed to any extent: a relatively undeveloped design featuring a premixed fuel and air transpiration <b>burner,</b> and a <b>turbulent</b> diffusion type <b>burner</b> system developed by Mechanical Technology, Inc. To evaluate and optimize the design concepts, an analytical model was developed that examined design and performance variables. The model calculated key temperatures, allowing the specification of materials requirements. Adherence to American National Standards Institute appliance furnace code material specifications was assumed. Concepts for EHS control systems were evaluated, and a cost-effective control system design was developed for the <b>turbulent</b> diffusion <b>burner</b> EHS. The study reveals that optimizing the diffusion burner EHS design can result in significant cost savings. No clear choice between the diffusion burner and transpiration burner systems could be determined from this study, but the designs of both were further developed and improved.

40|$|Pilot flames, {{created by}} {{additional}} injectors of pure fuel, {{are often used}} in <b>turbulent</b> <b>burners</b> to enhance flame stabilisation and reduce combustion instabilities. The exact mechanisms through which these additional rich zones modify the flame anchoring location and the combustion dynamics are often difficult to identify, especially when they include unsteady hydrodynamic motion. This study presents Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of the reacting flow within a large-scale gas turbine burner for two different cases of piloting, where either 2 or 6 {{percent of the total}} methane used in the burner is injected through additional pilot flame lines. For each case, LES shows how the pilot fuel injection affects both flame stabilisation and flame stability. The 6 percent case leads to a stable flame and limited hydrodynamic perturbations in the initial flame zone. The 2 percent case is less stable, with a small-lift-off of the flame and a Precessing Vortex Core (PVC) in the cold stabilisation zone. This PVC traps some of the lean cold gases issuing from the pilot passage stream, changes the flame stabilisation point and induces instability...|$|R
40|$|Equivalence ratios {{measured}} with a laser induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS, also referred as LIBS) are reported in two different setups. First, a small premixed <b>turbulent</b> <b>burner</b> is used to address fundamental issues concerning the LIPS technique. It is shown that hydrogen excitation within the created plasma is the key parameter to measure in order to retrieve correctly equivalence ratio measurements. Results compared with a spark energy classification strategy show better results with excitation classification, as variations in ratio between the different lines come not only from gaseous concentration but also from plasma's characteristics. Using spectra from 450 to 800 nm allows the determination of two independent emission ratios to improve single shot accuracy. The developed approach is afterwards applied to phase-locked measurements of equivalence ratio in a lean premixed combustor, for which strong thermo-acoustics oscillations exist. This combustor runs with methane–air, preheated at 700 K and with a typical equivalence ratio of 0. 50, for which the sound pressure levels of the oscillations are 170 dB. Measurements at the inlet of the combustor reveal strong correlations between fluctuations of the incoming stoichiometry and pressure fluctuations. It is shown that stoichiometry changes within one oscillating cycle of about 3 %. Those changes are crucial for the flame dynamics as dealing with very lean mixtures...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000337200700009 International audienceA {{sub-grid}} scale closure for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion {{based on}} physical-space filtering of laminar flames is discussed. Applied to an unstructured grid, the combustion LES filter size is not fixed {{in this novel}} approach devoted to LES with refined meshes, but calibrated depending {{on the local level}} of unresolved scalar fluctuations. The context is premixed or stratified flames, the derived model relies on four balance equations for mixture fraction and its variance, and a progress variable and its variance. The proposed formalism is based on a presumed probability density function (PDF) derived from the filtered flames. Closures for the terms of the equations that are unresolved over LES grids are achieved through the PDF. The method uses flamelet tabulated detailed chemistry and is first applied to the simulation of laminar flames (1 D and 2 D) over various grids for validation, before simulating a <b>turbulent</b> <b>burner</b> studied experimentally by Sweeney et al. (2012). Since this burner also features differential diffusion effects, the numerical model is modified to account for accumulation of carbon in the recirculation zone behind the bluff-body. A differential diffusion number based on the gradient of residence times is proposed, in an attempt to globally quantify differential diffusion effects in burners. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies using}} {{particle}} image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) {{have raised the}} question of how these measurements should be compared. This study reports on the difference between Favre-averaged and Reynolds-averaged velocity statistics for a <b>turbulent</b> <b>burner</b> using PIV and LDA for unconditional and conditional velocity measurements. The experimental characterization of flow fields of premixed and stratified methane/air flames is carried out under globally turbulent lean conditions (global equivalence ratio at 0. 75), over a range of stratifications and swirl numbers. Unconditioned velocity data was acquired using aluminium oxide to seed the flow field. Conditioned measurements were performed using vegetable oil aerosol as seed, which burns through the flame front, thus allowing only the non-reacting flow velocities to be obtained. A critical comparison of unconditioned velocity profiles measured using both PIV and LDA, including axial, radial, and tangential components is made against conditioned and reconstructed mean velocities at different cross-sections of the flame. The comparison reveals how the differences between the Favre-averaged (unconditioned) and the Reynolds-averaged (conditioned) velocity measurements in the flame brush region can be accounted for using the mean progress of reaction, and highlights the limits of the accuracy and agreement between PIV and LDA measurements.

Following these improvements, the capabilities of the water mist generation system were characterized both using a classical mass balance approach and using more modern advanced diagnostic techniques. The <b>turbulent</b> line <b>burner</b> facility fitted with the water mist improvements were applied to suppress a 50 kW methane flame.

40|$|In 1990, Congress enacted an {{amendment}} to the Clean Air Act that required reductions in NOx emissions through the application of low NOx burner systems on fossil fueled utility steam generators. For most of the existing steam generator population, the original burning equipment incorporated highly <b>turbulent</b> <b>burners</b> that created significant in-furnace flame interaction. Thus, the measurement and control of air flow to the individual burners was much less critical than in recent years with low NOx combustion systems. With low NOx sys-tems, the reduction of NOx emissions, as well as minimizing flyash unburned carbon levels, is very much dependent on the ability to control the relative ratios of air and fuel on a per-burner basis and their rate of mixing, particularly in the near burner zones. AMC Power (AMC) and DB Riley, Inc. (DBR), and a large Midwestern electric utility have successfully developed and applied AMC’s equipment to low NOx coal burners in order to enhance NOx control combustion systems. The results have improved burner optimization and provided real time continuous air flow balancing capability and the control of individual burner stoichiometries. To date, these enhancements have been applied to wall-fired low NOx systems for balanc-ing individual burner air flows in a common windbox and to staged combustion systems. Most recently, calibration testing in a wind tunnel facility of AMC’s individual burner air measurement (IBAM™) probes installed in DB Riley’s low NOx CCV ® burners has demon-strated the ability to produce reproducible and consistent air flow measurement accurate to within 5 %.

40|$|Tunable {{diode laser}} {{absorption}} spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurement of H 2 O gas temperatures {{was carried out}} in a heated cell and a turbulent premixed burner at a repetition rate of up to 20 kHz. A near 2. 0 µm distributed feedback (DFB) laser operating at room temperature was developed and all optical components were assembled in a box shown in Fig. 1. The absorption lines for CO 2 and H 2 O gas were carefully selected from the HITRAN / HITEMP database, considering its sensitivity. To measure high temperatures over 1000 K, the ratio of the H 2 O absorption line strength at 5008. 101 cm- 1 and 4878. 193 cm- 1 was used. A heated static cell filled with gas was used to evaluate the apparatus, the measured temperature agreed with the preset gas temperature, and the accuracy was within 5 %. A premixed <b>turbulent</b> <b>burner</b> was selected for actual measurements (Fig. 2). The gas velocity was measured using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system, which revealed the characteristics of turbulent flows throughout the flame region. The measurement location was chosen carefully, based on this data. The temperature of the gas on the inner cone of a turbulent premixed flame was measured at 20 kHz. The time-averaged measured gas temperature was 1351 K and 37 K root mean square (RMS), for which the thermo-couple showed 1336 K and 99 K RMS shown in Fig. 3. The profile of the measured temperature probability density function (PDF) was almost Gaussian. There was good agreement with the thermocouple results for both measurements.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{experimental}} investigation to study turbulent flame characteristics using laser based methods is presented. Combustion inside almost all technical industrial devices takes place under turbulent environment. In addition, {{a significant amount}} of effort is ongoing to improve the knowledge of turbulent combustion. This work is focussed on the turbulent-chemistry interaction, which remains to be the bottleneck problem in turbulent combustion. Combustion flames from <b>turbulent</b> opposed jet <b>burner</b> and swirl stabilized burner have been investigated using laser induced fluorescence utilizing single-point, single-scalar as well as state of the art multi-scalar, planar technique. Investigation on flames from <b>turbulent</b> opposed jet <b>burner</b> has been carried out. With the same burner set-up, flames from the partially-premixed mode to the premixed mode have been studied while varying parameters like Reynolds numbers and equivalence ratio. The results from the current work provide a detailed insight on flame physics, flame front characteristics, flame front dynamics and extinction phenomenon. Local flame area distribution results have been evaluated and used to confirm for the flame symmetry of <b>turbulent</b> opposed jet <b>burner.</b> It is found that flame stability is decreased not due to small wrinkling of the flame front but due to the total flame stretch, thus confirming the presence of "young turbulence". Young turbulence is characterized by large eddies that yet do not have decayed to smaller structures along the turbulent energy cascade due to limited residence time. In addition it is also concluded that flame extinction phenomenon is due to the large eddies rather than small eddies that disrupts the reaction zone. A technical relevant lean premixed flame from a swirled stabilized <b>turbulent</b> jet <b>burner</b> was used as another test case. Location of peak heat release rate using state of the art planar laser induced fluorescence has been studied in this flame. Single laser system has been used to simultaneously detect two molecular species namely, hydroxyl [OH] and formaldehyde [HCHO]. Snap-shot of peak heat release rate have been provided by simultaneously multiplying spatially and temporarily matched images from both detected molecule. 1000 single-shot images have been taken to build sufficient and clean statistical results. In addition to the experimental work, advanced image processing routines have been developed and applied for automatic data enhancement and analysis. Several algorithms employing filters, smoothing functions and image enhancement were tested and checked for their end results. Sensitive analysis to choose the combination of right parameters has been also done and is specific to the images evaluated in the present work. Lastly, experimental investigation from the current thesis will help in building a data bank for such flames. As the numerical models due to their limitations, requires experimental information to test for their efficacy and capabilities, these results will help to validate numerical models...|$|R

Perforated panels backed by a cavity are widely used as acoustic liners, mostly in the hot gas region of combustion chambers to reduce pure tone noises. This paper focuses on the implementation of this technology in the injection line of a burner. The system is used to control the inlet acoustic reﬂection coefficient of the burner to stabilize the combustion. This method is shown to be particularly efficient because high acoustic ﬂuxes issued from the combustion region are concentrated on a small surface area in the injection line. Theoretical results are used to design two types of perforated plates featuring similar acoustic damping properties when submitted to low amplitude pressure ﬂuctuations (linear regime). Their behaviors nonetheless largely differ when facing large pressure ﬂuctuations levels (non linear regime) typical of those encountered during self-sustained combustion oscillations. Design criteria are given to control the reﬂection coefficient of perforated panels submitted to high pressure ﬂuctuations levels and damp thermo-acoustic oscillations.

The developed {{model for the}} subgrid burning velocity is shown to cor-rectly reflect Damköhler’s limits for large- and small-scale turbulence. From {{the discussion of the}} regime diagram for turbulent premixed combustion, it is shown that given a particular configuration of flow pa-rameters, changes in the LES filter width result in changes along constant Karlovitz number lines. The Karlovitz number is chosen as the horizontal axis to construct a new regime diagram for LES of premixed turbulent combustion, where changes in the filter width are represented by vertical lines. In addition, some new regimes appear in the new diagram, which are related to the numerical treatment. An important conclusion is that changes in the filter width cannot result in changes of the combustion regime among the corrugated flamelets, thin reaction zones, and broken reaction zones regimes. This is a consistency requirement for the model, since the choice of the filter width cannot change the fundamental combustion mode. With decreasing filter width, changes from corrugated to wrinkled flamelets, or in general to a laminar regime, are possible.

Radiative heat transfer is significant because it is a primary mode of heat transfer for many combustion devices. This study also provides quantitative data that can be available for validation of numerical efforts. Eleven liquid fuels were burned ranging from traditional and alternative jet fuels (e. g. Jet-A) to single and multi-component large hydrocarbons. The latter is used to investigate the role of hydrocarbon classes in radiation emissions and visible soot production.

A premixed pilot flame burning ethylene and air was used to stabilize the central jet of vaporized fuel. The vaporized fuel exited the burner at 300 º C. The radiative heat flux and the radiation intensity were measured using a radiometer and a mid-infrared camera (FLIR, SC 6700), respectively.

40|$|A Precessing Jet (PJ) burner {{has been}} {{developed}} which enhances large scale turbulence {{by means of a}} naturally occurring fluid-mechanical phenomenon. A highly stable gas flame is produced without air swirl, quarl or a bluff body stabiliser. The resulting natural gas flame is lower in temperature and is more luminous than flames from many conventional burners so that it reduces NO x emissions while achieving almost total burnout of combustibles. The high luminosity indicates potential for increased fuel utilisation efficiency in process industries where radiation heat transfer is important. For one configuration of the PJ burner firing natural gas in an 18 MW industrial cement kiln, NO x emissions are shown to be reduced by 75 % with a simultaneous reduction in CO when compared with the original <b>turbulent</b> jet <b>burner.</b> Photographs of these flames show that the PJ burner produces a more rapidly spreading and more luminous flame. For another configuration, firing natural gas in a 25 kW laboratory furnace, the radiation spectra of the flame produced by the PJ burner are compared with a high quality commercial swirl burner. The mean radiation intensity produced by the PJ burner is some twenty times that of the commercial burner in the visible spectrum and the normalised fluctuating intensity is about 50 %, some five times that of the commercial burner in the visible range. Good potential for flame detectability is therefore apparent. Mean intensity is shown to increase by a factor of three with the addition of swirl to the air. G. J. Nathan, R. E. Luxto...|$|R

40|$|Large Eddy Simulation (LES) {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} useful tool for the prediction of turbulent reactive flows with the increasing availability of cheaper and faster computing power. In the context of premixed combustion, LES encounters the challenge of resolving the flame thickness, which is normally smaller than the filter width used in typical engineering applications. This thesis considers the Flame Surface Density (FSD) approach to provide closure to the filtered LES reaction rate. The FSD can either be modelled algebraically (FSDA) or determined through a transport equation (FSDT) and both approaches are investigated in the LES of three different test cases. The first case explores the response of different FSDA models towards changes in turbulence levels, and compares the instantaneous flame structures and reaction rates predicted by FSDA and FSDT methods. The remaining cases examine the LES of two <b>turbulent</b> premixed <b>burners.</b> A relatively large range of FSDA models are tested under the same operating conditions for the first time, and the LES-FSDT equation is applied to premixed flames that involve {{a higher level of}} geometric complexity than earlier work. Generally, the results show that the performance of some FSDA models are inconsistent between the two premixed burners, suggesting that the models may operate optimally under different turbulent conditions. By contrast, the consistently good agreement of the FSDT results with experiments suggests that the method has much potential in the LES modelling of turbulent premixed flames. However, the improved FSDT predictions were dependent on the value of the model constant within the sub-grid curvature model, and the value yielded an additional dependency on filter width. For these reasons {{as well as for the}} higher computational expense, the effective use of FSDT requires further development, while the application of the FSDA models remains a viable alternative to the FSDT approach.

The vitiated coflow emulates the recirculation region of most combustors, such as gas turbines or furnaces.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a diagnostic technique and data processing routine to measure the flame index in partially-premixed flames, called the Flame Index Measurement Method. Many modern combustion applications involve conditions in which the fuel and oxidizer are only partially mixed prior to entering the flame. These partially-premixed flames contain some regions of premixed and some regions of non-premixed flamelets. New computational approaches use the flame index concept: premixed regions are identified and a premixed model is applied; non-premixed regions are also identified and a non-premixed model is applied. The flame index is defined as the normalized dot product of the gradients of the fuel and oxidizer mass fractions; it is + 1 in premixed flamelets and is - 1 in non-premixed flamelets. Previously there had been no experimentally measured values of flame index available to assess the modeling approaches. A new method has been developed to measure the flame index using planar laser-induced fluorescence tracers to indicate the sign and direction of the fuel and oxygen gradients. Through the modeling of premixed and non-premixed flamelets, acetone was selected as a fuel tracer and nitrogen dioxide was selected as an oxygen tracer. The fluorescence properties of both acetone and nitrogen dioxide were studied. With acetone seeded into the fuel, and nitrogen dioxide seeded into the air, the Flame Index Measurement Method was evaluated in laminar premixed and non-premixed methane/acetone/air flames, as well as in a well-defined <b>turbulent</b> partially-premixed <b>burner,</b> the Gas Turbine Model Combustor (GTMC). The flame index was measured in the GTMC with methane, propane, and syngas flames. Statistics (mean, variance, and probability mass functions) of the flame index are reported for the highly-turbulent partially-premixed GTMC flames. Two new statistical quantities were developed that describe the probability for the occurrence of premixed flamelets and the degree of partial-premixing. Aspects of the new measurement technique are discussed, including: signal-to-noise ratio, tracer gas seeding levels, data analysis/gradient identification methods, and uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Large-hydrocarbon fuels {{are used}} for ground and air {{transportation}} because of their high energy-density and {{will be for the}} foreseeable future. However, combustion of large-hydrocarbon fuels in a turbulent environment is poorly understood and difficult to predict. The turbulent flame speed, which is the velocity at which a flame front propagates through a turbulent fuel and air mixture, is a key property in turbulent combustion. The turbulent flame speed {{can be used as a}} model input parameter for tur- bulent combustion simulations. However, turbulent flame speeds for large-hydrocarbon fuels are largely unknown. These values are needed to improve combustion models and enhance understanding of the physics and chemistry that control turbulent combustion of large-hydrocarbon fuels. The objective of this study is to measure the turbulent flame speed of large-hydrocarbon fuels and to identify key physics in the turbulent combustion of these fuels. This is motivated by the use of the turbulent flame speeds in modeling combustion in practical devices and the significant use of large-hydrocarbons in these devices. This research has broad implications for society and industry; both the Federal Aviation Administration and gas turbine engine companies have called for research on the turbulent flame speeds of large-hydrocarbon fuels. The turbulent flame speed in this work is defined as the global consumption speed, and is measured for three fuels on a <b>turbulent</b> Bunsen <b>burner.</b> The Reynolds number, turbulence intensity, preheat temperature, and equivalent ratio can be independently controlled using the burner. A conventional Jet-A fuel, known as A 2, is used as a reference because of its common use in commercial and military aviation. A 2 is compared to bi-modal and quadra-modal blends referred to as C 1 and C 5, respectively. These fuels are selected as they have similar heat releases and laminar flame speeds. Time-averaged line of site images of OH*, CH*, and CO₂* chemiluminescence are used to determine an the average flame front area. This flame area is used to determine the global consumption speed. The global consumption speed is measured for Reynolds number and equivalence ratio ranging between 5. 000 - 10. 000 and 0. 7 - 1, respectively. Turbulence intensities are varied between 10...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} premixed turbulent combustion {{can be performed}} at high spatial resolutions due to the continuously increasing computational power. At {{a resolution of the}} order of the laminar flame thickness there is negligible turbulence in the subgrid level and a proper reconstruction of the filtered flame is adequate for accurate predictions. In this scenario, which can be termed as a coarse scale Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), reconstruction of the filtered flame using a spatially filtered flamelet (1 -D laminar flame) is analysed. First, DNS of a <b>turbulent</b> premixed slot <b>burner</b> is computed to generate a reference database. This database is filtered at different length scales of the order of laminar flame thickness for an a priori assessment of turbulent flame reconstruction using a filtered flamelet. The filtered DNS source term, molecular diffusion and subgrid convection of the reaction progress variable is compared with a flamelet convoluted with top-hat profiles of the same order. The source term and molecular diffusion are approximated well from the filtered flamelet while the unresolved convection shows deviation. Finally, the reconstruction of the turbulent flame is tested a posteriori on the same filter widths (mesh size) and the results are compared. It is found that a flamelet filtered spatially at the order of the computational mesh and tabulated using a single controlling variable i. e. the reaction progress variable is suitable for a coarse scale DNS of premixed turbulent combustion...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of stratification {{on the structure}} of turbulent methane/air combustion is investigated using experimental data from laboratory scale burners: a weakly <b>turbulent</b> slot <b>burner,</b> and a higher turbulence co-annular swirl burner. The degree of stratification can be controlled independently of the overall fuel/air flow rate. The resulting measurements of scalar and velocity fields provide detailed test cases for existing and emerging turbulent flame models, covering a range of u'/sL from 1 to 10, turbulence intensities from 5 % to 60 %, and stratification ratios from 1 to 3. Simultaneous Rayleigh/Raman/CO-LIF measurements of temperature and major species concentrations - CH 4, CO 2, CO, H 2, H 2 O and O 2 - along a line are used to investigate the structure of a series of flames in both the slot and swirl burners. Concurrent cross-planar OH-PLIF allows thermal gradients to be angle corrected to their three-dimensional values. Finally, non-reacting and reacting velocity fields complete the flame database. The behavior of major species concentrations in the slot and swirl burner with respect to temperature is found to agree well on the mean with unstrained premixed laminar flame calculations. Scalar means conditioned on stoichiometry also show good agreement, aside from hydrogen which is enhanced under stratified conditions. Surface density function and scalar dissipation are lower than calculated values in all cases, suggesting that turbulence-induced thickening dominates the effect of increased strain. Metrics commonly used to derive flame surface density (FSD) were investigated. FSD may be determined using a statistical method based on measurements of temperature and its gradient, or a geometric method based on 2 D temperature or LIF imaging. A third metric, an extension of the geometric method, is proposed. Good agreement is observed between the three metrics. The current database provides the first detailed high resolution scalar measurements for premixed and stratified flames. The data analysis provides insight into the physics of stratification: for the flames considered, the effects of stratification appear to be surprisingly small compared to those of turbulence, even at significant stratification ratios. The datasets provide a means of validating current and future computational turbulent combustion models.

50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 <b>turbulent</b> P.F. <b>burners</b> arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|R
40|$|Since its inception, the low-swirl burner (LSB) {{has shown}} to be a useful {{laboratory}} apparatus for fundamental studies of premixed turbulent flames. The LSB operates under wide ranges of equivalence ratios, flow rates, and turbulence intensities. Its flame is lifted and detached from the burner and allows easy access for laser diagnostics. The flame brush is axisymmetric and propagates normal to the incident reactants. Therefore, the LSB is well suited for investigating detailed flame structures and empirical coefficients such as flame speed, turbulence transport, and flame generated turbulence. Due to its capability to stabilize ultra-lean premixed turbulent flames (phi approx. = 0. 55), the LSB has generated interest from the gas appliance industry for use as an economical low-NO(x) burner. Lean premixed combustion emits low levels of NO(x), due primarily to the low flame temperature. Therefore, it is a very effective NO(x) prevention method without involving selective catalytic reduction (SCR), fuel-air staging, or flue gas recirculation (FGR). En the gas turbine industry, substantial research efforts have already been undertaken and engines with lean premixed combustors are already in use. For commercial and residential applications, premixed pulsed combustors and premixed ceramic matrix burners are commercially available. These lean premixed combustion technologies, however, tend to be elaborate but have relatively limited operational flexibility, and higher capital, operating and maintenance costs. Consequently, these industries are continuing the development of lean premixed combustion technologies as well as exploring new concepts. This paper summarizes the research effects we have undertaken {{in the past few years}} to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the low-swirl flame stabilization method for a wide range of heating and power generation systems. The principle of flame stabilization by low-swirl is counter to the conventional high-swirl methods that rely on a recirculation zone to anchor the flame. In LSBS, flow recirculation is not promoted to allow the premixed turbulent flames to propagate freely. A LSB with an air-jet swirler is essentially an open tube with the swirler at its mid section. The small air-jets generate swirling motion only in the annular region and leaving the central core of the flow undisturbed, When this flow exits the burner tube, the angular momentum generates radial mean pressure gradient to diverge the non-swirling reactants stream. Consequently, the mean flow velocity decreases linearly. Propagating against this decelerating flow, the flame self-sustains at the position where the local flow velocity equals the flame speed, S(sub f). The LSB operates with a swirl number, S, between 0. 02 to 0. 1. This is much lower than the minimum S of 0. 6 required for the high-swirl burners. We found that the swirl number needed for flame stabilization varies only slightly with fuel type, flow velocity, <b>turbulent</b> conditions and <b>burner</b> dimensions (i. e. throat diameter and swirl injection angle) ...|$|R
