Tapping the glass bottle causes the ketchup to become thinner {{and easier to}} pour. Heinz suggests, on its website, that {{the best place to}} tap the bottle is on the [...] "57" [...] mark.

40|$|THE {{purpose of}} this report is to pre-sent data showing the effect of corn {{fermentation}} condensed solubles in the diet of growing chickens. As early as 1954 Combs and co-workers reported the presence of unidentified growth factors in a "grain fermentation solubles product. " More recently, Camp et al. (1957), reported the presence of growth factor(s) in liquid corn steep-water as evidenced by chick growth stim-ulation when this ingredient was added to a practical-type diet. Corn fermentation condensed solubles is a product derived from corn prior to processing the grain for manufacture of starches, sugars and syrups. The {{first step in the}} wet milling of corn is the steeping process. This is the extrac-tion of the water-soluble fraction of corn. The grain is soaked in dilute sulfurous acid at pH 4. 0 for about 40 hours at 125 °F. Steeping removes from the corn essen-tially all of the water soluble components. These represent approximately 6. 5 per-cent of the weight of corn processed. During the steeping cycle, there is a build up of native organisms that thrive in the environment created and, among other things, they convert part of the available reducing sugars extracted from the grain to lactic acid. The corn fermentation solubles fraction is condensed by removal of moisture to approximately 50 percent solids. Corn fermentation condensed solubles is a brown colored, somewhat <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquid.</b> The following analysis is typical...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquids</b> the {{rheological}} properties {{depend on the}} liquid’s deformation history. Clay suspensions (as encountered in oil sands mining) are a prominent example. Activated clay particles form a network. As a consequence of (ionic) transport limitations, the network is not an instantaneous feature; {{it takes time to}} build up, and also to break down, the latter as a result of deformation in the liquid. In this paper a procedure for detailed simulations of flow of viscous <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquids</b> is outlined. The local viscosity of the liquid relates to the level of integrity of the network. The time-dependence of the liquid’s rheology is due to the finite rate with which the network in the liquid builds up or breaks down. This concept has been incorporated in a lattice-Boltzmann discretization of the flow equations. With this methodology the way <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquids</b> are mobilized in mixing tanks and the drag force experienced by dense assemblies of coarse particles (e. g. sand) in <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquids</b> have been studied...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} transitional and turbulent flows of purely viscous <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquids</b> in stirred tanks have been performed. The simple thixotropy model employed {{is based on}} the notion of a network in the liquid with an integrity that builds up with finite rate under quiescent conditions and breaks down under liquid deformation. We solve a transport equation for the network integrity which is two-way coupled to the lattice-Boltzmann-based flow solver. The liquid’s time scale characterized by the dimensionless Deborah number shows a profound impact on the level of mobilization and the flow patterns in the mixing tanks, especially if the time scale of the liquid is of the same order as the circulation time in the tank. It also is demonstrated to what extent increasing the impeller speed improves mobilization and mixing...|$|R
50|$|Gel stains are a late 20th century {{innovation}} in stain manufacturing, {{in that they}} are high-viscosity liquids and do not 'flow'. This property allows more control during application, particularly when the wood is in a vertical position, which can often cause traditional liquid stains to run, drip, or pool. Gel stains often have limited penetrating ability, as they are <b>thixotropic</b> (a <b>liquid</b> that nevertheless does not 'flow').|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Norcross {{viscometer}} after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device {{is based on a}} piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an air lifting mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space which is formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain <b>thixotropic</b> <b>liquids.</b> The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The viscosity controller measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as efflux cup), Saybolt universal second (SUS) or centipoise.|$|R
