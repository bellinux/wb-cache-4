5|$|In 1997 and 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> met the Utah Jazz in the Finals twice. Led by Olympians John Stockton and Karl Malone, the Jazz were {{defeated}} in both Finals by <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning {{shots in the}} sixth and deciding game — the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and managing their second three-peat. However, prior to the 1999 season, Jackson decided to retire, which set off a chain reaction that resulted {{in most of the}} team, including Jordan and Pippen, requesting to leave <b>the</b> <b>Bulls.</b> With no foundation of youth to build upon, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> became a lottery-bound team for the next six seasons.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990–91 season, Jordan won {{his second}} MVP award after {{averaging}} 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg {{for the regular}} season. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> finished in first place in their division {{for the first time}} in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> had elevated their play. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 2017, Wade and <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> {{agreed to}} a buyout of the {{remaining}} year on his contract. He reportedly gave back roughly $8 million of his $23.2 million contract {{as part of the}} agreement. Wade was formally placed on waivers by <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> the following day.|$|E
5000|$|The pega {{involves}} eight forcados who challenge <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> {{with their}} bare hands. They form a line facing <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> and <b>the</b> forcado da cara (front man) eggs <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> on by [...] "playing" [...] {{with it and}} taking steps forward if necessary {{to get it to}} charge. Once <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> runs forward <b>the</b> first forcado times his hold of <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> head. Once on <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> head and holding onto it, usually around its neck, six forcados jump upon <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> piling upon themselves and grabbing <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> while one forcado grabs <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> by its tail. The objective is to subdue <b>the</b> <b>bull,</b> to stop it. The forcado who grabbed <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> by <b>the</b> tail (rabejador) is the last one to release <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> after it is subdued. Bull's horns are covered with a protection of leather to prevent it from injuring forcados. Although in popular street bullfights some bulls are released without any protection at all - [...] "em pontas".|$|R
50|$|Daffy Duck {{drives to}} Mexico for a vacation, {{and after a}} {{harrowing}} experience with the local cuisine that literally sets his mouth afire, Daffy goes to a bullfight ring to observe the spectacle. When Daffy jeers at <b>the</b> <b>bull,</b> <b>the</b> horned beast removes the clothes from the human matador and puts them on Daffy {{as a challenge to}} the duck to fight <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> in <b>the</b> ring. Daffy foils <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> with a proposed wager on a hat trick, betting <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> to guess which of three sombreros Daffy is hiding under. Daffy sees to it that <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> guesses wrong and supplies a machine gun for <b>the</b> impoverished <b>bull</b> to commit suicide. <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> realizes that he is being fooled and, firing the machine gun, chases Daffy out of the bullfight ring. Daffy scrambles to his car to leave Mexico, thinking he has escaped <b>the</b> belligerent <b>bull.</b> But <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> is riding {{in the back seat of}} Daffy's vehicle, unbeknownst to Daffy.|$|R
50|$|A picador is a bullfighter {{who uses}} a special lance called pica while on horseback to test <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> {{strength}} and to provide clues to the matador on which side <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> is favoring. They perform in the tercio de varas {{which is the first}} of the three stages in a Spanish bullfight. The shape of the lance or pica is regulated by Spanish law to prevent serious injury to <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> which was viewed as unfair cheating in <b>the</b> past. <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> will charge <b>the</b> horses in the ring and, at the moments prior to contact, the picador lances <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> in a large muscle {{at the back of the}} neck; thus begins the work of lowering his head. The picador continues to stab at <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> neck leading to the animal's first major loss of blood. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> injured nape will fatigue—however, as a result of <b>the</b> enraged <b>bull</b> charging, <b>the</b> picador's horse will tussle with avoiding <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> throes at trying to lift the horse with its horns. The enduring loss of blood and exertion gradually weakens <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> further and makes it ready for the next stage.|$|R
5|$|Sloan played ten {{seasons with}} <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> {{and became the}} Bulls' {{franchise}} leader in games played when he retired in 1976, a record which has since been broken by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. He then coached <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> from 1979 to 1982, and in 1988, embarked upon a coaching career with the Utah Jazz that lasted 23 years. Sloan has since been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach, as has fellow draftee John Thompson. The latter never worked for <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> in any capacity, but found success as a coach at Georgetown University.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> {{entered the}} 1989–90 {{season as a}} team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young {{improving}} players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and {{under the guidance of}} new coach Phil Jackson. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg in leading <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> to a 55–27 record. They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> {{initially}} {{competed in}} the NBA's Western Division. The Western Division was renamed the Western Conference in 1970, and was split into the Midwest and Pacific Divisions. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> played in the Midwest Division until 1980, when they moved to the Central Division of the Eastern Conference.|$|E

5000|$|According to Jeremy McInerney, the {{iconography}} of <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> permeates Minoan culture. [...] The cult of <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> was also prominent in southwestern Anatolia. Bernard Clive Dietrich notes {{that the most important}} animal in the Neolithic shrines at Çatalhöyük was <b>the</b> <b>bull.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> was a chthonic animal associated with fertility and vegetation. It figured in cave cults connected with rites for the dead.|$|R
5|$|The Chicago Bulls are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team {{based in}} Chicago, Illinois. Dick Klein founded <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> in 1966 {{after a number}} of other {{professional}} basketball teams in Chicago had failed. In their 50 seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> have achieved a winning record 25 times, and have appeared in the NBA playoffs 34 times. They received international recognition in the 1990s when All-Star shooting guard Michael Jordan led them to their six league championships. The only NBA franchises that have won more championships than <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> are the Boston Celtics (17 championships) and Los Angeles Lakers (16).|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 21head coaches for <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> franchise. Phil Jackson {{is also the}} franchise's all-time leader in regular season games coached, regular season games won, playoff games coached, and playoff games won. Jackson and Jerry Sloan are the only Bulls coaches to have been {{inducted}} into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach. Kerr, Dick Motta, Jackson, and Thibodeau have won NBA Coach of the Year with the team. Ed Badger, Bill Berry, Bill Cartwright, Pete Myers and Jim Boylan have all spent their entire NBA head coaching careers with <b>the</b> <b>Bulls.</b> Sloan, Cartwright, and Myers formerly played for <b>the</b> <b>Bulls.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{his short}} stint in baseball, Jordan {{returned}} to basketball {{late in the}} 1994–95 season. Although he did not lead <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> to the Finals, he returned to pre-retirement form the next year while the team acquired perennial rebounding champion Dennis Rodman. The 1995–96 Bulls finished the regular season 72–10, attaining, at the time, the best regular season record in NBA history (Later surpassed by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015-16 season {{with a record of}} 73-9). They dominated in the playoffs, with series records of 3–0, 4–1 and 4–0, before facing the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals. After <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> took a 3–0 series lead, Seattle won the next two games after coach George Karl switched point guard Gary Payton onto Jordan, leading to a sixth game. However, Jordan altered his game to accommodate the advances of Payton, and <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> won Game 6 to win their fourth title.|$|E
5000|$|Fearful for <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> life, <b>the</b> princess {{told him}} of her stepmother's plan. <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> decided that they must flee together. They passed through a forest made of copper trees and {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> {{told her not to}} break off any branches, she broke off a leaf. Seeing this, <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> told <b>the</b> princess to keep the leaf safe and not lose it under any circumstances.|$|R
50|$|July 28. Yawar Fiesta ("blood festival") in Andahuaylas. A special {{bullfight}} {{in which}} a condor {{is tied to the}} back of <b>the</b> <b>bull.</b> In its efforts to release itself from the back of <b>the</b> <b>bull,</b> <b>the</b> condor wounds <b>the</b> <b>bull.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> is then killed by the condor, or by the villagers. The condor is released after the fiesta. Also, there are cockfights and the traditional ride to the lake Paqucha, for good trout fishing.|$|R
50|$|Bull baiting dogs, {{including}} bulldogs and pit bulls, were bred to bait animals, mainly bulls and bears. During bull-baiting the {{dog would}} attempt to flatten itself to the ground, creeping as close to <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> as possible, then darting out and attempting to bite <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> in <b>the</b> nose or head area. <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> would often be tethered by a collar and rope which was staked into the ground. As the dog darted at <b>the</b> <b>bull,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> {{would attempt to}} catch the dog with his head and horns and throw it into the air.|$|R
5|$|After the 1997–1998 NBA season, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> {{started a}} massive {{rebuilding}} phase, largely {{at the behest}} of then-general manager Jerry Krause. Head coach Phil Jackson and several members of the team left via free agency or retirement, including Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr, and Jud Buechler. Rodman was released by <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> on January 21, 1999, {{before the start of the}} lockout-shortened 1998–99 NBA season. With his sister acting as his agent at the time, Rodman joined the Los Angeles Lakers, for a pro-rated salary for the remainder of the 1998–1999 season. With the Lakers he only played in 23games and was released.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{did have}} one {{strength}} on defense: forcing turnovers. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> recovered 20fumbles and caught eightinterceptions on the year. Buffalo's turnover margin of +1.15 was 6thbest in the nation.|$|E
50|$|While Wukong is unconscious, <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Demon King fights the Jade Emperor once more. This time, <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Demon King savagely {{beats the}} Emperor, {{knocking}} him unconscious as well. Erlang Shen suddenly shows up {{to land the}} killing the blow on his uncle, but <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Demon King brushes him aside. As he watches <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Demon King sit on the throne of Heaven, Erlang Shen realizes the demon {{was never going to}} keep his promise. He attempts to fight <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Demon King as well only to be killed.|$|R
5000|$|The princess and <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> {{continued}} to travel {{until they came}} upon a castle. <b>The</b> <b>bull</b> gave her a wooden cloak {{and told her to}} ask for work at the castle as [...] "Katie Woodencloak". However, she must first cut off <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> head, flay him, and put the hide away in a rock, along with the leaves and apple. Should she need anything, <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> told <b>the</b> princess to knock on the stone. Though at first the princess refused to kill <b>the</b> <b>bull,</b> she was eventually persuaded.|$|R
50|$|If the matador has {{performed}} particularly well, the crowd may petition the president by waving white handkerchiefs to award the matador an ear of <b>the</b> <b>bull.</b> If his performance was exceptional, {{the president will}} award two ears. In certain more rural rings, the practice includes an award of <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> tail. Very rarely, if the public or the matador believe that <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> has fought extremely bravely, the event's president may be petitioned to grant <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> a pardon (indulto). If the indulto is granted, <b>the</b> <b>bull's</b> life is spared; it leaves the ring alive and is returned to its home ranch. There <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> becomes a stud {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|R
5|$|Holtz {{earned his}} first win {{as head coach}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> on September 1, 2010 in USF's season opener against Stony Brook 59–14. Later that season, Holtz would lead his Bulls to the program's first victory over the Miami Hurricanes. At {{the end of the}} season Holtz lead the USF Bulls to a mostly {{dominant}} 31–26 victory over the Clemson Tigers at the Meineke Car Care Bowl. This would mark the first Bowl victory for USF over a BCS team. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> finished with an 8–5 record, but 3–4 in Big East play.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jordan was matched against {{close friend}} Charles Barkley, {{who was the}} league's reigning MVP at the Phoenix Suns. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> won {{the first two games}} in Phoenix, with 100–92 and 111–108 as the final scores, respectively. The Suns, {{rallying}} behind Barkley, won Game 3, 129–121, in Chicago in triple overtime. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> took Game 4, 111–105, with Jordan scoring 55 points and tying Rick Barry for the second-most points in an NBA Finals game. The Suns won Game 5, 108–98, sending the series back to Phoenix. Chicago won the series clincher in Game 6, 99–98,on John Paxson's three-pointer, as <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> became the third team in history to three-peat. After this win, Jordan would retire from basketball to pursue a career in baseball.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993–94 season, <b>the</b> <b>Bulls,</b> without Jordan, {{achieved}} a 55–27 record, {{and lost to}} the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs. But the 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March. The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for <b>the</b> <b>Bulls.</b>|$|E
50|$|The seventh labour was {{to capture}} <b>the</b> Cretan <b>Bull.</b> Hercules sailed to Crete, where King Minos gave Hercules {{permission}} to take <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> away and even offered him assistance (which Hercules declined plausibly {{because he did}} not want the labor to be discounted as before). <b>The</b> <b>Bull</b> had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Hercules sneaked up behind <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his pithos at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> to Hera, who hated Hercules. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Hercules. <b>The</b> <b>Bull</b> was released and wandered into Marathon, becoming known as <b>the</b> Marathonian <b>Bull.</b> Theseus would later sacrifice <b>the</b> <b>bull</b> to Athena and/or Apollo.|$|R

Jordan led the league with 28.7 points per game, securing his fifth regular-season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team and the All-Star Game MVP. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; {{it was the first}} time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the Knicks. After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{responded by}} scoring 38 {{points in the}} next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan {{decided that he would}} resume wearing his former number, 23, immediately. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA. Jordan was fined an {{additional}} $5,000 for opting to wear white shoes as the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> wore black. He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in 6 games.|$|E
