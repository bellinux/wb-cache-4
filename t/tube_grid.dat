40|$|The paper {{describes}} a two-section electronic device for better recording of rapid bioelectric phenomena on the cathode-ray oscillograph screen. In section A (fig. 2), proportional brightening of the trace during transient phenomena {{is achieved by}} application of a suitable positive voltage to the cathode-ray <b>tube</b> <b>grid</b> (Z input). This voltage, proportional {{to the increase in}} writing-speed of the spot, is obtained by differentiation of the input signal. In section B (fig. 3), intensity modulation is produced by a positive square voltage applied to the grid. The square pulse is delivered by a one-shot multivibrator, triggered by the phenomenon under observation. This same device, used as a negative pulse-generator driven by an external oscillator, may produce intensity-modulated timing markers which blank the trace at known intervals. The use of either beam-intensifying device described is discussed in the paper. © 1956, All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|As an {{autonomous}} navigation method, X-ray pulsar navigation can provide position, timing and attitude information for various spacecrafts. Since the X-rays (1 - 20 keV) from the pulsar can not penetrate the earth atmosphere, an X-ray source in laboratory {{needs to be}} set up to test and calibrate the detector.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a high {{resolution}} X-ray simulation source is proposed {{and designed to}} verify the navigation based on X-ray pulsar in the simulation experience system. The simulation source consists of an arbitrary signal generator and a grid controlled X-ray tube. According to the grid tube's characteristic curve, the data of the pulsar standard pulse template are converted. Then using the method of direct digital frequency synthesis, the converted data are synthesized to waveforms, called the analog modulated grid voltage. In the grid controlled X-ray tube, the grid voltage changes the number of electrons hitting on the target and controls the X-ray intensity. With an analog modulated pulse profile applied on the <b>tube</b> <b>grid</b> electrode, the tube will emit X-rays which will match photons' statistical distribution and simulate the X-ray pulsar profile extremely well. The properties of Crab pulsar simulation source are tested in X-ray pulsar navigation simulation experience system. The results of the test are as follows: Comparing the tested pulse profile with the standard pulsar profile, we have time correlation coefficient is 0. 9774, and frequency correlation coefficient is 0. 9853. The X-ray photon flux is 1. 90 ph. cm(- 2). s(- 1), the pulsed fraction is 76. 15 %, and the half-width half maximum is 1. 879 ms. These {{results show that the}} X-ray simulation source has several merits, such as: strong ability to simulate the X-ray, low cost and simple operation.
