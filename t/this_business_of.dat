500|$|When Bloodworth arrived, {{the flames}} were {{consuming}} the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores {{on the river}} front. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused {{on the grounds that}} most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, [...] "Pish! A woman could piss it out", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: [...] "People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [...] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> the fire, laying it all upon him." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Twain biographer Albert Bigelow Paine, [...] "Twain, of course, was {{fiercely}} stirred. The missionary {{idea had}} seldom appealed to him, and coupled with <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> bloodshed, {{it was less}} attractive than usual. He printed the clippings in full, one following the other; then he said:By happy luck we get all these glad tidings on Christmas Eve—just the time to enable us to celebrate the day with proper gaiety and enthusiasm. Our spirits soar and we find we can even make jokes; taels I win, heads you lose.|$|E
2500|$|The {{guilt or}} innocence of these two Italians {{is not the issue}} that has excited the opinion of the world. Possibly they were actual murderers, and still more {{possibly}} they knew more than they would admit about the crime.... Europe is not [...] "retrying" [...] Sacco and Vanzetti or anything of the sort. It is saying what it thinks of Judge Thayer. Executing political opponents as political opponents after the fashion of Mussolini and Moscow we can understand, or bandits as bandits; but <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> trying and executing murderers as Reds, or Reds as murderers, seems to be a new and very frightening line for the courts of a State in the most powerful and civilized Union on earth to pursue.|$|E
2500|$|With {{everything}} stage-bound, {{production was}} smooth and problems were few, and small—for instance, Claude Rains, who stood three or four inches shorter than Ingrid Bergman. [...] " [...] <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> you being a midget with a wife, Miss Bergman, who is very tall," [...] the director kidded with Rains, a good friend. For the scenes where Rains and Bergman were to walk hand-in-hand, Hitchcock devised a system of ramps that boosted Rains's height yet were unseen by the camera. He also suggested Rains try elevator shoes: [...] "Walk in them, sleep in them, be comfortable in them." [...] Rains did, and used them thereafter. Hitchcock gave Rains the choice of playing Sebastian with a German or his English accent; Rains chose the latter.|$|E

2500|$|In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history." [...] Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, [...] "This is the end of <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, a major {{target for}} {{investment}} was the [...] Dutch East India Company (VOC). The VOC encountered a rough patch around 1670, {{after a very}} profitable period {{up to that time}}. The causes were a price war for market share with the English East India Company after the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and an embargo on the export of precious metals (especially silver) by the Japanese Shogunate, which ended the profitable intra-Asiatic trade the company had conducted up to that time (<b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> trade within the East-Asian market had financed the spice trade of the company up to that time, and obviated the need to export European silver and gold to pay for Asian commodities it imported in Europe). The VOC now opted for a policy of great expansion of its business, by branching out to Asian bulk products, like textiles, coffee, tea and porcelain. Other than the pepper and spices it had a near-monopoly on, these were high-volume low-profit commodities. The size of the company doubled in this period (making it the largest publicly traded company in the world at the time), but this was [...] "profitless" [...] growth that did not really solve the company's problems.|$|E
60|$|As Queequeg and I are now fairly {{embarked}} in <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> whaling; and as <b>this</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> whaling {{has somehow}} {{come to be}} regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.|$|E
