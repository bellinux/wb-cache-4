500|$|All That Is Within Me {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{some of which}} considered it to be MercyMe's best record to that point. However, some critics considered the album as being too similar to the band's previous works. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "regardless of whether the credit goes to the change of scenery or the backs-against-the-wall pressure, {{it is impossible to}} deny that this is the group's best effort to date" [...] and praised Millard's vocals as well as the album's [...] "sparkling array of musical styles". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted the album's shift toward music geared towards the church, and said [...] "No matter what tag the industry puts on these guys, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they continually make great music with broad-based appeal". Mike Parker of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, called it an [...] "exuberant,defiant, stand-up-and-shake-your-fist at-the-devil, rock & roll worship album" [...] and [...] "MercyMe’s best work to date". Cameron Conant of Charisma praised Millard's vocals as having [...] "a wonderful pop-country style that seems to get better as this album goes along" [...] and saying [...] "All 10 songs on this album prove that it's no accident MercyMe has sold millions of records... It's catchy pop music with a clear gospel message that will resonate with all of MercyMe's fans—a considerable group—and should win them a few new ones, too".|$|E
500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby {{wrote in}} his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna's singing in the song [...] "deserved a {{commendation}} for bravery and {{was a sign that}} she was going to set herself challenges." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which is rife with emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'."

500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L.

Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E

He tried to produce some things for this new album, but we could tell early on that his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore.
