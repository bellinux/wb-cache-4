Successful development of the optical coke detector will provide industry with the only available method for on-line measurement of coke deposits. The optical coke detector will have numerous uses in the refining and petrochemical sectors including monitoring of visbreakers, hydrotreaters, delayed coking units, vacuum tower heaters, and various other heavy oil heating applications where coke formation is a problem. The coke detector will particularly benefit the olefins industry where high temperature thermal crackers are used to produce ethylene, propylene, butylene and other important olefin intermediates. <b>The</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>industry</b> requires development of an on-line method for gauging the thickness of coke deposits in cracking furnaces because the current lack of detailed knowledge of coke deposition profiles introduces the single greatest uncertainty in the simulation and control of modern cracking furnaces.

40|$|Inherent {{safety is}} a concept that enables risk {{reduction}} through elimination or reduction of hazards at the grass root level of a process development cycle. This proactive approach aids in achieving effective risk management while minimizing fixed and operating cost. Several indices which quantify the measures of inherent safety have been identified and by applying these techniques on conceptual design stage, an estimate of the inherent risk and additional safety cost measures can be developed. This approach facilitates easy decision making in an early stage, for choosing the best process that is superior in process, economic and safety performance. Yet, these quantitative techniques are not being used effectively in process industries. In this thesis, a comparative approach was developed wherein, two different process technologies producing same chemical were compared through techno-economic and safety analysis, to identify the superior process. Recent advancements in shale gas monetization have contributed to the growth and expansion of large number of petrochemical plants, particularly <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>industry.</b> For this thesis, the production of ethylene through two process technologies were considered, such that one route is the primary process route while other is a novel process that is still in development stage.

40|$|AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO 2) {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{is a key}} climate {{mitigation}} technology that can global CO 2 emissions by thousands of megatonnes of CO 2 annually. CCS is almost certainly required, along with a wide portfolio of other technologies in an “all of the above” strategy, to achieve the reductions in global CO 2 emissions necessary to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO 2. Despite many high-profile demonstration projects, commercial-scale CCS deployment is still impeded by multiple issues including economic viability, public awareness and acceptance, and regulation and permitting. Developing a large-scale, highly visible and economically feasible CCS network—in addition to existing investment approaches— {{will be required to}} overcome these barriers to widespread CCS adoption. We propose a pathway to an integrated CCS network that connects multiple industrial CO 2 sources and geologic storage reservoirs using existing CCS technologies. Specifically, we propose that such a network could utilize CO 2 emissions from ethylene manufacturing for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the U. S. Gulf Coast region, creating a regional ethylene:CO 2 -EOR network. The ethylene market presents several key advantages for capturing CO 2 : ethylene is a high-value chemical with a price that can readily absorb capture costs (unlike fossil fuel electricity generation), ethylene sources are both closely clustered and emit a large volume of CO 2, and existing capture technology is cost-competitive when coupled with nearby EOR reservoirs. Our analysis describes the techno-economic potential of CO 2 capture and EOR, the potential policy implications, and how <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>industry</b> could be an ideal first-mover for jumpstarting commercial-scale CCS operations. As part of this analysis we identify the costs and CO 2 flows for ethylene production and EOR across the Gulf Coast region. We introduce the concepts of “byproduct CO 2 ” (CO 2 as a byproduct or waste stream from an existing industry such as power generation) and “extracted CO 2 ” (naturally-occurring CO 2 extracted from subsurface reservoirs for EOR); extracted CO 2 cannot decrease the carbon footprint of oil production, unlike byproduct CO 2.

40|$|Solanum lycopersicum or tomato is {{extensively}} {{studied with}} respect to <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> metabolism during climacteric ripening, focusing almost exclusively on fruit pericarp. In this work <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> biosynthesis pathway was examined in all major tomato fruit tissues: pericarp, septa, columella, placenta, locular gel and seeds. <b>The</b> tissue specific <b>ethylene</b> production rate was measured throughout fruit development, climacteric ripening and postharvest storage. All ethylene intermediate metabolites (1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), malonyl-ACC (MACC) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)) and enzyme activities (ACC-oxidase (ACO) and ACC-synthase (ACS)) were assessed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene initiates {{important}} aspects of plant growth and development through disulfide-linked receptor dimers located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The receptors feature a small transmembrane, ethylene binding domain followed by a large cytosolic domain, {{which serves as a}} scaffold for the assembly of large molecular weight complexes of different ethylene receptors and other cellular participants of <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> signaling pathway. Here we report the crystallographic structures of <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> receptor 1 (ETR 1) catalytic ATP-binding and <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> response sensor 1 dimerization histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domains and the solution structure of the entire cytosolic domain of ETR 1, all from Arabidopsis thaliana. <b>The</b> isolated dimeric <b>ethylene</b> response sensor 1 DHp domain is asymmetric, the result of different helical bending angles close to the conserved His residue. The structures of the catalytic ATP-binding, DHp, and receiver domains of ethylene receptors and of a homologous, but dissimilar, GAF domain were refined against experimental small angle x-ray scattering data, leading to a structural model of the entire cytosolic domain of <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> receptor 1. <b>The</b> model illustrates that the cytosolic domain is shaped like a dumbbell and that the receiver domain is flexible and assumes a position different from those observed in prokaryotic histidine kinases. Furthermore the cytosolic domain of ETR 1 plays a key role, interacting with all other receptors and several participants of <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> signaling pathway. Our model, therefore, provides the first step toward a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanics of this important signal transduction process in plants...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{membranes}} for hydrogen separation {{has been}} applied commercially in recent years. Several new membrane materials, which are now commercially available, are seriously being considered for the separation of hydrogen both effectively and efficiently within <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> process. This study investigates the feasibility of hydrogen separation from the cracked gas in an optimal manner before entering the low-temperature section of <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> plant. This separation would consequently reduce the refrigeration load {{as well as the}} equipment size of the cold-box section. Polyimide membrane materials are very selective for hydrogen transport as compared to other hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethylene. Polysulfone has also proven to be selective for the separation of hydrogen from hydrocarbons. This study evaluates two new commercial polyimide membranes as well as a new polysulfone membrane and determines the feasibility of hydrogen separation before entering the low-temperature section of <b>the</b> <b>ethylene</b> plant. <b>The</b> performance of the membranes and their effects on <b>the</b> overall <b>ethylene</b> process are also presented...|$|R
