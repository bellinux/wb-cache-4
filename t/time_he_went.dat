5|$|Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, {{a former}} {{high-ranking}} {{officer in the}} army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, began his work in 1796– a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth. At that <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to Paris, and later, Milan, where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits, and who superficially appeared receptive to the idea of liberating Poland. Dąbrowski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions, which would be part of {{the army of the}} newly created Republic of Lombardy. This agreement, drafted by Napoleon, was signed on 9 January 1797, and marked the formal creation of the Legions.|$|E
5|$|John Stanford {{hoped that}} his son would follow him into the legal {{profession}} but accepted his decision to pursue music as a career. However, he stipulated that Stanford should have a conventional university education before going on to musical studies abroad. Stanford tried unsuccessfully for a classics scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, but gained an organ scholarship, and later a classics scholarship, at Queens' College. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> up to Cambridge in 1870 he had written {{a substantial number of}} compositions, including vocal music, both sacred and secular, and orchestral works (a rondo for cello and orchestra and a concert overture).|$|E

5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the occupying authority in Norway started cracking down harder on opposition. A strike over milk rations in September led to the arrest and execution of the two labour leaders Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm. This was followed by several high-profile arrests – among them Einar Gerhardsen – and Lie had to flee the country. He left his house only hours before the Germans appeared to arrest him. From Sweden {{he made his way}} to the United Kingdom, where he worked as a propaganda secretary for the exiled Norwegian labour movement in London. He made two visits to the United States to gather support and financial aid, the first <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> from New York City to Seattle where he held a series of lectures and radio-interviews before he travelled through Canada from the west- to the east coast. The second trip was as a labour attaché with diplomatic status. While Haakon was in exile, his brother Per, who was also a labour activist, was arrested in Norway in 1942. He was imprisoned and eventually sent to Dachau, where he died from typhoid fever in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|At daylight, German tanks {{caught the}} 24th and 25th Battalions, {{positioned}} {{in the relatively}} shallow El Mrier Depression together with 6th Brigade headquarters, by surprise. Firing {{from the edge of}} a low cliff overlooking the depression, the Germans caused heavy losses amongst the 24th and 25th Battalions before passing through their positions in pursuit of the British armour. George, the battalion's commander, was captured along with 149 others. Over 200 other men were also killed or wounded. The survivors, back under the command of Burton who was once again the senior surviving company commander, were aggrieved at the lack of armoured support. The 6th Brigade moved to the southern section of the Alamein line where it manned defensive positions during the Battle of Alam Halfa, Rommel's failed attempt to cut off the 8th Army. The battalion at this time numbered 362 personnel, which included one company which had been left back at Maadi and brought forward to rejoin the survivors of the El Mrier battle. Burton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the battalion until 12 September at which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> on leave and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bonifant.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>went</b> on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E

5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> in.|$|E
5|$|McLaughlin {{split the}} 1978 season between {{the major leagues}} and minors. McLaughlin made his season debut with Seattle on April 25, against the California Angels. In that game, which also marked his first MLB start, McLaughlin gave up three runs (all earned) and struck out 10 in six innings pitched. He came away with the loss, which was his first MLB decision. In late June the Mariners sent {{him down to the}} minor leagues. With the San Jose Missions, who were the Mariners Triple-A {{affiliate}} at the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> 5–2 with a 3.50 ERA, and 52 strikeouts in eight games, all starts. Two of those starts were complete games. McLaughlin was called back up to the majors in July after pitcher John Montague was placed on the disabled list. McLaughlin's first major league win came on August 16, against the Baltimore Orioles. In the majors that season, McLaughlin went 4–8 with a 4.37 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 20 games, 17 starts. Four of his starts were complete games. After the 1978 season, McLaughlin pitched in the Mexican Pacific League, where he led all pitchers with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E

25|$|After Ampleforth, Hume went on {{to study}} at St Benet's Hall, Oxford, a Benedictine institution, where he {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts in modern history.

Sextus involved his younger brother in mercantile pursuits while he was there until 1838 at which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to Westfield Academy to prepare for college. Extremely bright, Hungerford excelled in English, Latin and Greek grammar, which gave him a solid foundation for a liberal arts education.|$|E
