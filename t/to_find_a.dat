5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because {{the two types of}} uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
