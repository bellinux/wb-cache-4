5|$|Following Bubble Boy, Gyllenhaal starred {{opposite}} Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Ellen Pompeo in Moonlight Mile, as a {{young man}} coping with the death of his fiancée and <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> of her parents. The story, which received mixed reviews, is loosely based on writer/director Brad Silberling's personal experiences following the murder of his girlfriend, Rebecca Schaeffer.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Lépine's mother Monique {{published}} Aftermath, {{a memoir}} of her own journey through <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> and pain of the incident. She had stayed silent until 2006, {{when she decided to}} speak {{out for the first time}} in the wake of that year's Dawson College shooting.|$|E
5|$|Ross Goodall {{subsequently}} {{communicated with}} Capaldi through the actor's agent, to inform him that Thomas's grandmother had died. (Helen, aged 72, died in early October 2014.) He told Capaldi {{that his son}} was not dealing well with <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> from his grandmother's death. The family received the subsequent video message to Thomas from Capaldi {{three weeks after the}} death of the child's grandmother.|$|E

25|$|Determined to {{help the}} boys slay <b>the</b> <b>griefer,</b> <b>the</b> {{executives}} decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths, a weapon so powerful that it {{was removed from the}} game and stored on a 1 GB USB flash drive. Unaware of the plan however, the boys have already initiated what becomes a seventeen-hour battle against <b>the</b> <b>griefer.</b> <b>The</b> executives arrive at Stan's house with the flash drive, unaware that the boys are actually at Cartman's house. Randy tells the executives that he can log in with the sword and give it to the boys' characters online. Eventually logging onto a demo of the game at a Best Buy, Randy gives Stan the weapon, but Randy's character is mortally wounded by <b>the</b> <b>griefer</b> in <b>the</b> process. Enraged, Stan attacks <b>the</b> <b>griefer</b> with <b>the</b> sword, allowing Kyle and Kenny to attack. Cartman approaches him and proceeds to smash the griefer's head with a hammer. Numerous World of Warcraft players celebrate the griefer's demise, praising the boys as heroes.|$|R
25|$|Cartman gathers all {{the boys}} of South Park and convinces them all to log in {{at the same time}} in order to execute a massive retaliatory attack on <b>the</b> <b>griefer.</b> However, once <b>the</b> battle begins, <b>the</b> <b>griefer</b> summons giant {{scorpions}} and easily dispatches the boys' characters. Cartman convinces Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to keep playing. For the next two months, the boys play the game for 21 hours a day, killing low-level boars in the game's forests to gain experience points. In the process, the boys become lazy, long-haired, obese and acne-ridden. The boys' characters grow so quickly that the Blizzard executives, who have also been monitoring <b>the</b> <b>griefer,</b> take notice.|$|R
5|$|Without {{speaking}} directly of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with <b>the</b> <b>grief.</b> In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.|$|E
5|$|As Pat Moran recovers in the hospital, {{he sends}} {{messengers}} out to contact {{his wife and}} child, but they all fail to find them. One day, the blind girl has lost her way and stumbles into the hospital grounds. She encounters the doctor and tells him of her story and plight. Weakly reclining in a chair nearby, Pat Moran overhears her and recognizes the girl as his daughter. <b>The</b> <b>grief</b> of the separated family abates with their reunion and doctor's assurance that the blind girl that her sight can be restored.|$|E
5|$|Lexie feels guilt {{following}} George's death, having {{abandoned their}} friendship after {{he failed to}} reciprocate her romantic feelings towards him. Mark comforts her, and she eventually agrees to move into his new apartment with him. Thatcher is {{admitted into the hospital}} with liver failure stemming from his former alcoholism. When Lexie is found to not be a suitable transplant candidate, Meredith steps in and donates part of her liver, not to help Thatcher, but to spare Lexie <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> of losing her father and because Lexie inappropriately pulled Meredith's medical files and begged her to.|$|E

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|Most of Kassandra's {{family has}} {{come to think of}} her as mad, and become angry when she feels {{compelled}} to vocalize prophecies that foretell the end of Troy. Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three young sons of Helen and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector and his younger brother Troilus are killed, to <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> of everyone in Troy. Akhilles kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatally poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{focused on}} the {{development}} of his homestead as {{a way to deal with}} <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> of losing his son. The settlement became known as Scott's Landing, and Scott briefly served as a tobacco inspector for the area. Determined to make Scott's Landing the centerpiece of a larger settlement called Petersburg, he began selling lots near the settlement in November 1788. Among those who purchased lots were James Wilkinson, Abraham Buford, Judge George Muter, and future Congressman and Kentucky Governor Christopher Greenup.|$|E

5|$|The Earl {{returned}} to England in December 1586, but was sent {{again to the}} Netherlands in the following June—to <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> of his wife, as the young Earl of Essex remarked in a letter. Leicester eventually resigned his post in December 1587. The Countess was {{with him when he}} died unexpectedly, possibly of malaria, on 4 September 1588 at Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire; they had been on their way to Kenilworth and Buxton. The Earl's funeral at Warwick in October 1588 was attended by his widow as well as numerous members of her family circle.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grief</b> of the Barker {{family was}} {{especially}} acute on February 28 and March 1 since {{those were the}} birthdays of Barker and her father, and they were planning to have a joint celebration that week. The police stated that {{they were working on}} several leads but had no developments. On Saturday, March 2, the FBI was officially called in following the provisions of the Federal Kidnapping Act. Several nearby dumps were searched to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{continued}} to appeal against court decisions which ruled that funding for Blenheim {{should come from}} the Marlboroughs' personal estate, and not the government. This made her unpopular; she could easily afford the payments herself. She was surprised by <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> she felt {{following the death of}} her eldest living daughter in 1733. Sarah lived to see her enemy Robert Walpole fall in 1742, and in the same year attempted to improve her reputation by approving a biographical publication titled An Account of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710. She died of old age, at the age of eighty-four, on 18 October 1744, at Marlborough House; she was buried at Blenheim. Her husband’s body was exhumed from Westminster Abbey and buried beside her.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was {{stillborn}} on 31 January 1510. About {{four months}} later, Catherine again became pregnant. On New Year's Day 1511, the child – Henry – was born. After <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> {{of losing their}} first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held, including a two-day joust known as the 1511 Westminster Tournament. However, the child died seven weeks later. Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1514 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, Mary. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.|$|E
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with <b>the</b> <b>grief</b> is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

25|$|Bereavement, while {{a normal}} part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe {{reactions}} affect approximately 10% to 15% of people. Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event. Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the death of a child, for example. Others have found no increase.
