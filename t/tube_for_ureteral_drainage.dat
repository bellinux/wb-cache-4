40|$|Introduction Cloacal exstrophy {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} with an {{incidence of}} 1 : 200, 000 to 1 : 400, 000 live births. It {{represents one of the}} most challenging reconstructive endeavors faced by pediatric surgeons and urologists. Aside from the genitourinary defects, there are other associated anomalies of the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and neurological systems that require a multidisciplinary approach when counseling anxious parents. Material and Methods We present a video of a patient with cloacal exstrophy treated with 21 days of life. Surgery consisted of separation and tubularization of the cecal plate from the exstrophied bladder halves and colostomy construction. The bladder was closed primarily and umbilical scar reconstructed and used <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> and cistostomy <b>drainage.</b> A urethral catheter was used to guide bladder neck tubularization. A final epispadic penis was obtained and planned for further repair in a second step. Results The patient had an initial uneventful postoperative course and immediate outcome was excellent. The bladder healed nicely but patient presented with abdominal distension in the 5 th day of postoperative setting requiring parenteral nutrition. The distal colon persisted with lower diameter although non obstructive, but causing difficulty for fecal progression. Continuous colostomy dilatation and irrigation were required. Conclusions Approximating the bladder halves in the midline at birth and primary bladder closure is a viable option, intestinal transit may be a issue of concern in the early postoperative follow-up.

40|$|Stress incontinence, urge incontinence, and pyelitis of {{pregnancy}} are common urological {{conditions in the}} female. Poor therapeutic results {{in the treatment of}} stress incontinence may be traced to errors in diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is based on an accurate history, residual urine test, the stress test, cystometric studies (to rule out neurogenic disturbances), cystourethroscopy and cystourethrography. The most important factor in the production of urge incontinence is infection. Some pathological conditions which may be associated with urge incontinence are urethritis, cystitis, urethral stricture, bladder-neck obstruction, urethral diverticula, urethral caruncle and the urgencyfrequency syndrome. Therapy is directed toward the eradication of infection and treatment of the specific lesion. In pyelitis {{of pregnancy}} it is urged that, in cases of unusual bacterial virulence and poor <b>ureteral</b> <b>drainage,</b> early cystoscopic <b>ureteral</b> catheter <b>drainage</b> should be instituted in order to prevent permanent kidney damage. The closest co-operation of urologist, gynecologist and general physician is necessary for clarification of some of the more complex problems...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe {{limitations}} of traditional ureteral stents {{in patients with}} deficiencies in <b>ureteral</b> <b>drainage</b> have resulted in frequent stent exchanges. The implementation of metallic stents was introduced to improve the patency rates of patients with chronic upper urinary tract obstruction, obviating the need for frequent stent exchanges. We report our clinical experiences {{with the use of}} metallic ureteral stents in the management of poor <b>ureteral</b> <b>drainage.</b> Materials and MethodsFifty patients underwent metallic ureteral stent placement from 2009 to 2012. Stent failure was defined as an unplanned stent exchange, need <b>for</b> nephrostomy <b>tube</b> placement, increasing hydronephrosis with stent in place, or an elevation in serum creatinine. Stent life was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier methodology, as this was a time dependent continuous variable. A cost analysis was similarly conducted. ResultsA total of 97 metallic stents were placed among our cohort of patients: 63 in cases of malignant obstruction, 33 in the setting of cutaneous ureterostomies, and 1 in an ileal conduit urinary diversion. Overall, stent failure occurred in 8. 2 % of the stents placed. Median stent life was 288. 4 days (95 % CI: 277. 4 - 321. 2 days). The estimated annual cost for traditional polymer stents (exchanged every 90 days) was $ 9, 648 -$ 13, 128, while the estimated cost for metallic stents was $ 4, 211 -$ 5, 313. ConclusionOur results indicate that metallic ureteral stent placement is a technically feasible procedure with minimal complications and is well tolerated among patients. Metallic stents can be left in situ for longer durations and provide a significant financial benefit when compared to traditional polymer stents...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluate {{the initial}} {{experience}} of laparoscopic <b>ureteral</b> reimplant <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2008, 10 patients underwent 11 laparoscopic reconstruction surgeries <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stenosis. Seven cases of stenosis of the distal ureter, {{two at the}} level of iliac vessels, a case of bilateral distal stenosis and one in the medium third. Eight ureteroneocystotomies were performed by extravesical technique with anti-reflux mechanism, two cases of vesical reimplant with Boari technique and one case using the psoas hitch technique. RESULTS: The average surgical time was 166 minutes (115 - 245 min), mean blood loss was 162 mL (100 - 210 mL) and the average hospital stay was 2. 9 days (2 - 4 days). There were two complications: a lesion of the sigmoid colon identified peroperatively and treated with laparoscopic sutures with good evolution, and a case of ureteral stone obstruction at the 30 th day postoperative, treated by laser ureterolitotripsy. All patients had resolution of the stenosis at an average follow-up period of 18 months (3 - 54 months).

40|$|Propose: Ureteral stents are {{commonly}} placed after routine ureteroscopic procedures to prevent acute obstruction.

40|$|Background: There {{are many}} options for urologists to treat {{ureteral}} stones {{that range from}} 8 mm to 15 mm, including ESWL and ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy. While both ESWL and ureteroscopy are effective and minimally invasive procedures, there is still controversy over {{which one is more}} suitable <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones. Objective: To perform a retrospective study to compare the efficiency, safety and complications using ESWL vs. ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy in management of ureteral stones. Methods: Between October 2010 and October 2012, 160 patients who underwent ESWL or ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy at Suzhou municipal hospital for a single radiopaque ureteral stone (the size 8 – 15 mm) were evaluated. All patients were followed up with ultrasonography for six months. Stone clearance rate, costs and complications were compared. Results: Similarity in stone clearance rate and treatment time between the two procedures; overall procedural time, analgesia requirement and total cost were significantly different. Renal colic and gross hematuria were more frequent with ESWL while voiding symptoms were more frequent with ureteroscopy. Both procedures used <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones ranging from 8 to 15 mm were safe and minimally invasive.

40|$|The {{management}} of ureteral stones in children {{is becoming more}} {{similar to that in}} adults. A number of factors {{must be taken into account}} when selecting one′s choice of therapy <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stone in children such as the size of the stone, its location, its composition, and urinary tract anatomy. Endoscopic lithotripsy in children has gradually become a major technique for the treatment of ureteral stones. The stone-free rate following urteroscopic lithotripsy <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones has been reported in as high as 98. 5 - 100 %. The safety and efficacy of Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy make it the intracorporeal lithotriptor of choice. Given its minimally invasive features, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has become a primary mode of treatment for the pediatric patients with reno-ureteral stones. Stone-free rates have been reported from 59 % to 91 % although some patients will require more than one treatment session for stone clearance. It appears that the first-line of therapy in the child with distal and mid-ureteral stones should be ureteroscopic lithotripsy. While ESWL is still widely considered the first-line therapy <b>for</b> proximal <b>ureteral</b> calculi, there is an increasing body of evidence that shows that endoscopic or ESWL are equally safe and efficacious in those clinical scenarios.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} procedure, {{postoperative}} outcome and complications {{of a new}} technique <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> implantation {{by means of a}} three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy in dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of dogs requiring ureteral implantation between April 2007 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed.

RESULTS: Nine dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Follow-up times ranged from 10 to 79 months (median 30 months), with 8 of 9 dogs having an excellent long-term outcome and no major postoperative complications. One dog with follicular cystitis as a comorbidity developed obstruction from inflammatory granuloma and required revision surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} patients' characteristics, {{surgical procedure}} data, and outcomes of ureterorenoscopy (URS) stone treatment {{in patients with}} a horseshoe kidney (HSK), ectopic kidney (EK), and malrotated kidney (MK). MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is a subanalysis of the Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society URS Global Study, which was a prospective multicenter observational study, collecting data on URS stone treatment from consecutive patients over a 1 -year period. A total of 114 centers in 32 countries participated. This analysis acuminated on URS stone treatment in the specified renal anomalies: HSK, EK, and MK. For each group, patient characteristics, operation data, and treatment outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Of the 11, 885 patients included in the Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society URS study, 43 patients had HSK, 27 EK, and 16 MK. The stone-free rate (SFR) in the HSK group was 77 % for renal stones and 85 % <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones. In the HSK group, the intraoperative complication rate was 11. 6 % and the postoperative complication rate was 7 %, including 1 Clavien grade IIIa and 1 IIIb complication. In the EK group, the SFR was 20 % for renal stones and 94 % <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones, with an intraoperative complication rate of 14. 8 % and a postoperative complication rate of 7. 4 %. One Clavien IVa complication was reported. In the MK group, the SFR was 71 % for renal stones and 88 % <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones, with an intraoperative complication rate of 6. 3 %. No postoperative complications occurred in this group. CONCLUSION URS is an effective and safe treatment modality to remove ureteral and renal stones in patients with HSK and MK. The effectiveness of URS for renal stones in EK was low. (C) 2017 Elsevier In...|$|R

We have performed endoscopic incision <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stricture using the holmium laser through a small-caliber ureteroscope. Methods: This method was used on five patients and seven ureters. The etiology of the stricture was stone scar in two patients, ureteroenteroanastomosis of Indiana urinary pouch in two, and primary in one. We used an 8 F semi-rigid or 6. 9 F flexible ureteroscope. No prior procedures, such as balloon dilation, were necessary {{in any of}} the cases. The stricture was incised with the holmium laser using a 365 -µm fiber through the working channel of the ureteroscope.

This study describes a personal experience {{of the causes of}} failure of the initial closure and operative morbidity during the surgical treatment of bladder-exstrophy complex. From April 2000 to March 2014, four patients aged 16 days to 7 years and 5 months underwent complex exstrophy-epispadias repair with pelvic osteotomies. There were three males and one female. Three of them had posterior pelvic osteotomy, one had anterior innominate osteotomy. Bladder Closure: Bladder closure was performed in three layers. Our first patient had initial bladder closure with polyglactin 4 / 0 (Vicryl ® 4 / 0), concerning the last three patients, initial bladder closure was performed with polydioxanone 4 / 0 (PDS ® 4 / 0). The bladder was repaired leaving the urethral stent and <b>ureteral</b> stents <b>for</b> full urinary drainage for three patients. In one case, only urethral stent was left, <b>ureteral</b> <b>drainage</b> was not possible, because stents sizes were more important than the ureteral diameter. Out of a total of four patients, initial bladder closure was completely achieved for three patients. At the immediate postoperative follow-up, two patients presented a complete disunion of the abdominal wall and bladder despite an appropriate postoperative care. The absorbable braided silk (polyglactin) used for the bladder closure was considered as the main factor in the failure of the bladder closure. The second cause of failure of the initial bladder closure was the incomplete urine <b>drainage,</b> <b>ureteral</b> catheterisation was not possible because the catheters sizes were too large compared with the diameters of the ureters. The failure of the initial bladder-exstrophy closure may be reduced by a closure with an absorbable monofilament silk and efficient urine <b>drainage</b> via <b>ureteral</b> catheterisation...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{an earlier}} study we {{demonstrated}} the feasibility to create tissue engineered venous scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. In this study we investigated the use of tissue engineered constructs <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> replacement {{in a long term}} orthotopic minipig model. In many different projects well functional ureretal tissue was established using tissue engineering in animals with short-time follow up (12 weeks). Therefore urothelial cells were harvested from the bladder, cultured, expanded in vitro, labelled with fluorescence and seeded onto the autologous veins, which were harvested from animals during a second surgery. Three days after cell seeding the right ureter was replaced with the cell-seeded matrices in six animals, while further 6 animals received an unseeded vein <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> replacement. The animals were sacrificed 12, 24, and 48 weeks after implantation. Gross examination, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), H&E staining, Trichrome Masson's Staining, and immunohistochemistry with pancytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3, smooth muscle alpha actin, and von Willebrand factor were performed in retrieved specimens. Results: The IVP and gross examination demonstrated that no animals with tissue engineered ureters and all animals of the control group presented with hydronephrosis after 12 weeks. In the 24 -week group, one tissue engineered and one unseeded vein revealed hydronephrosis. After 48 weeks all tissue engineered animals and none of the control group showed hydronephrosis on the treated side. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry revealed a multilayer of urothelial cells attached to the seeded venous grafts. Comclusions: Venous grafts may be a potential source <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> reconstruction. The results of so far published ureteral tissue engineering projects reveal data up to 12 weeks after implantation. Even if the animal numbers of this study are small, there is an increasing rate of hydronephrosis revealing failure of ureteral tissue engineering with autologous matrices in time points longer than 3 months after implantation.
