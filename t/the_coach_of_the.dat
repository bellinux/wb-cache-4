Brown offered Rymkus a $4,000 salary ($ today), double what he made with the Redskins.

In his last season as <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Redskins, calls for his firing had intensified as the team's performance worsened from a 7–7 record to a 5–9 record in his third year. The Washington Daily News called for his firing in a front-page editorial in November 1968. Lombardi took over as the Redskins' coach in 1969.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} five seasons, the Rockets either failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs or were {{eliminated}} in the first round. The first elimination in 1988 led to Fitch's dismissal, with Don Chaney replacing him as head coach. Chaney, like Olajuwon, also played for the Houston Cougars under Guy Lewis, having played along Elvin Hayes in the late 1960s. Chaney had his best season during 1990–91, where he was named <b>the</b> <b>Coach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year after leading the Rockets to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. Despite Olajuwon's usual strong numbers, the underwhelming roster could not be lifted out of mediocrity.
