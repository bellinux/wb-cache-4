5|$|The LNER did {{not want}} to take full {{responsibility}} for the line, and although they provided the services, ownership remained with the LPTB. In 1935 the LPTB, seeking to abandon steam power as much as possible, drew up a scheme to include electrification of the Amersham line as part of the New Works Programme. It was not planned <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the Chesham branch; instead, a diesel-powered GWR railcar was borrowed from the GWR for trials on the branch. Although the railcar performed well on the curves and slopes of the branch, the railcar had a capacity for only 70 passengers and was only able to haul light amounts of goods. The LPTB commissioned its own, larger, railcar design, {{but by the end of}} 1936, it decided instead <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the Chesham branch, and the railcar schemes were abandoned. The LPTB's plan envisaged electric trains splitting at Chalfont& Latimer, with half of each train continuing to Amersham and half to Chesham.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the time}} {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills and the act capped total construction costs at £12,000 per mile of track. £457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works. The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908, with tracks originally laid on Jarrah sleepers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, work <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the line from Liverpool Street to Shenfield began in association with the LNER. Progress had been halted by the war but work resumed after the end of hostilities. The line between Liverpool Street and Stratford was electrified from 3 December 1946, and the full electrification of the Shenfield line at 1500V DC was completed by late 1949. At the same time electrification of London Underground services in Essex and northeast and east London led to the withdrawal of some services from Liverpool Street, being replaced with LU operations. Electrification continued with the line to Chingford electrified by November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closure}} of the tramway allowed {{planning}} to go ahead for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line's construction competed with a proposal <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over {{the point at which the}} line would connect to the main line. Two early proposals to join the line at Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would connect with the main line at the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Kepple, {{one of the}} {{original}} Altoona & Wopsononock directors, was elected president of the newly organized company. The board remained largely unchanged, although Shellenberger finally severed his association with the railroad. It remained unprofitable, and Davis, in turn, sold the line to Sigmund Morris, of Altoona. Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern Railroad on November 7, 1912 to acquire the line, and the Altoona, Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16, 1913. Morris planned to convert the railroad <b>to</b> , <b>electrify</b> it to make it an interurban, and extend it to connect with the Beech Creek Railroad (a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad) at Patton. However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of New York City investors took over the railroad about 1916. They converted the railroad to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania Railroad 2-6-0s, but replacing them with Heislers when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s, NSB {{electrified}} the Sørland Line, {{although the}} final section from Egersund to Stavanger was not converted until 1956. In 1957, the Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line became the only line to remove the electrification and replace the electric locomotives with diesel power. The 1950s saw the electrification of several regional and commuter lines around Oslo, including the Kongsvinger Line, the Trunk Line and the Dovre Line from Lillestrøm to Hamar, the Vestfold Line and the Eastern Østfold Line. This was largely due to NSB's program to remove all steam locomotives, either by electrification or by dieselization. In the late 1950s and 1960s, several to-be electrified lines were operated with diesel locomotives as an interim solution. The 1960s saw the remaining two steam lines in Southern Norway, the Bergen and Dovre Lines, electrified along with the Gjøvik Line. The Bergen Line was completed in 1964 and the Dovre Line completed in 1970. This finished all the planned electrifications, and the authorities deemed the remaining lines unprofitable <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> because of low traffic. During the 1990s, a new program was attempted, this time <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the entire network, but only the Arendal Line was converted before the program was canceled. However, new lines around Oslo, including the Lieråsen and Oslo Tunnels on the Drammen Line, and the Gardermoen and Asker Lines were electrified {{at the time they}} opened. Further plans have been launched, in particular the section of the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, {{which is part of the}} Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and the Meråker Line, which connects to the electrified Central Line in Sweden.|$|E

5|$|In November 1970, the Dovre Line was electrified, and {{the last}} steam {{locomotives}} were retired. A long-term plan <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> half the lines was finished, and for two decades, NSB's operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines. NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed, but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled. In 1981, NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units. They were mainly used on the Nordland Line, and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the other lines, although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line. On 1 April 1987, a Di 3 612 caught on fire; the damage was small enough {{that it could have}} been repaired, but NSB instead decided to put aside the unit. At the time NSB planned to order additional Di 4, but these plans were put on hold. In 1988, the Valdres Line was closed; this was the only time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed.|$|E
5|$|Politicians have signalized {{that they}} want <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer along with the Meråker Line. NSB will need to replace the Class 92 trains towards the end the 2010s, and want to {{coordinate}} the new stock with electrification. The county municipalities of Nord-Trøndelag and Sør-Trøndelag proposed during the early 2000s that the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Steinkjer be upgraded reduce travel time to one hour. This would require the average speed to be increased to , mainly through a modernization of the existing line. Specific projects include electrification, double track between Trondheim and Trondheim Airport, additional passing loops, a new bridge over Stjørdalselva and a rearrangement of the tracks at Hell. This {{would have to be}} combined with a {{reduction in the number of}} stops. The National Rail Administration estimates that the mentioned investments, which would cost between NOK4 and 6 billion, will allow a travel time of one hour and ten minutes. If a number of curves are straightened, increased capacity is introduced between Stjørdal and Steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed, travel time could be reduced to one hour.|$|E
5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making calls on the unpaid portion of its shares, but activity eventually {{came to a stop}} and the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ today). He was involved in the development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and <b>to</b> <b>electrify</b> the District Railway.
