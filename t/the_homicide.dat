Wilford Brimley made a guest appearance as Harry Prentice, an ill and bed-ridden man who convinces his son to help him kill himself. Attanasio deliberately wrote the script {{so it would be}} morally questionable whether police handling of both the suicide and the police shooting were done in an ethically correct way.

In <b>the</b> <b>homicide</b> division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor.

5|$|Cher {{starred in}} three films in 1987. In Suspect, {{she played a}} public defender who is both helped and romanced {{by one of the}} jurors in <b>the</b> <b>homicide</b> case she is handling. Along with Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees {{involved}} with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick. In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow in love with her fiancé's younger brother. The two latter films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively. For her performance in Moonstruck, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had {{become one of the most}} bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1million per film.

5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>homicide</b> {{department}} is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E

The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; <b>the</b> <b>homicide</b> detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes.

5|$|Pembleton's {{investigation}} of fellow police officers for a suspicious shooting {{was based on}} a real-life investigation chronicled in David Simon's 1991 non-fiction book , from which <b>the</b> <b>Homicide</b> series was adapted. Baltimore Police Department Detective Donald Worden, on whom the Bolander character is based, handled the actual real-life investigation in 1988. However, Howard's affair with the perpetrator {{was not part of the}} real-life incident, but rather was added by Yoshimura as part of the show's efforts to ensure as many detectives were personally involved in the storylines as possible. Several members of the Baltimore Police Department publicly criticized Homicide for its negative portrayal of the police in the episode, and 22 detectives wrote a formal letter of protest to executive producer Barry Levinson over the matter. Cellist Zuill Bailey served as a body double for Ned Beatty in the scenes with Bolander playing cello. Bailey was studying at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory at the time, and his appearance on Homicide led to further collaborations with Tom Fontana, including a recurring guest appearance for Bailey on Fontana's drama series Oz.|$|E

Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court.

5|$|When {{a key to}} {{a room at the}} Marina View Hotel is {{delivered}} inside a jar of blood to <b>the</b> <b>Homicide</b> Department, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that the blood in the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread around the room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E
5|$|Yoshimura first {{pitched the}} show to the Homicide: Life on the Street {{production}} team in May 1997 at the San Francisco production center of executive producer Barry Levinson. The episode was discussed and well-received during a round-table discussion involving Levinson, executive producer Tom Fontana, producer David Simon, supervising producer Julie Martin, and consulting producer Gail Mutrux. During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve <b>the</b> <b>homicide</b> case quickly and get the trains moving again, an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script. Levinson suggested ending the episode with the detectives {{walking back to the}} surface, then feeling the hum and vibration of the train starting back up under their feet.

5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding <b>the</b> <b>homicide.</b> Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate.
