25|$|Faith Ryan Whittlesey (born 1939) is {{a former}} Pennsylvania Republican {{politician}} and White House Senior Staff member notable for her effort to communicate Reagan's entire policy agenda to U.S. opinion leaders and for bringing {{together for the first}} time in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House evangelical, Catholic, and other conservative religious groups who opposed legalized abortion and were concerned about moral and cultural decline and the break-up of the family. These groups became a significant component of the Reagan coalition as they grew more politically self-conscious in the 1980s. Whittlesey also organized the White House Central American Outreach Group at the direction of Chief of Staff James Baker to provide information about Reagan's anti-communist policies in the region and was an active supporter of Reagan's defense buildup and the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Whittlesey served twice for a total of nearly 5 years as U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and also served for 2 years on <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House Senior Staff as Assistant to the President for Public Liaison.|$|E

In October 1981, with President Reagan at his side, Atkinson became the first conservative Democrat to switch to the Republican Party in a Rose Garden ceremony at The White House. Austin became a Republican at that time also.|$|E
500|$|According to the White House, the {{incoming}} Clinton administration had heard reports of irregularities in the Travel Office and possible kickbacks {{to an office}} employee from a charter air company. [...] They looked at a review by KPMG Peat Marwick which discovered that Dale kept an off-book ledger, had $18,000 of unaccounted-for checks, and kept chaotic office records. [...] White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and the White House counsels thus decided to fire the Travel Office staff and reorganize it. [...] The actual terminations were done on May 19, 1993, by White House director of administration David Watkins. [...] There was also a feeling among the White House and its supporters that the Travel Office had never been investigated by the media due to its close relationship with press corps members and the plush accommodations it afforded them and favors it did for them. (Congress would later discover that in October 1988, a whistleblower within the Travel Office had alleged financial improprieties; <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House counsel looked into the claim but took no action.) ...|$|E

500|$|Perot was a hawk on the Vietnam War, an {{advocate}} for Americans held as prisoner of war and a supporter for their families. During the war, he aided soldiers by providing supplies and holding rallies for those returning home. In public affairs, he led the Texas War on Drugs Committee in 1979 {{at the behest of}} Republican Governor Bill Clements, and was put in charge of the Select Committee on Public Education in 1983 by Democratic Governor Mark White. Perot's most dear political effort involved the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He worked extensively to free soldiers that he believed had been left behind, and even engaged in secret diplomatic talks with the Vietnamese government, to the chagrin of <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House. Perot had been supportive of President Ronald Reagan and labeled him as a [...] "great president" [...] in 1986. He even pledged $2.5 million to support his presidential library, but the relationship soured after Perot was sent on a trip to Hanoi, and determined afterwards that the administration was not taking the POW/MIA issue seriously. He revoked his pledge to the library in 1987, based on the POW/MIA issue as well as his disillusionment from the administration's actions during the Iran–Contra affair. He became a critic of the George H. W. Bush administration, and opposed the 1991 Gulf War.|$|E

2500|$|From 1971 to 2011, {{there were}} 123 dissent cables. The most dissent cables sent {{in a single}} year came in 1977, when 28 dissent cables were filed [...] "under the Carter Administration, which {{everyone}} agrees created an atmosphere in which use of the channel was encouraged—or at least not stigmatized." [...] After Ronald Reagan became president, the number of dissent cables declined sharply, to 15 in 1981 and just five in 1982. This decline was due to a feeling in [...] "U.S. embassies around the world ... that <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House and State Department were not receptive to viewpoints that diverged from the ambassadors' assessments," [...] and that dissenting cables was likely to damage a diplomat's career.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} Ronald Reagan seal was created entirely by her plankowner crew with {{historical}} assistance provided by staff members at <b>the</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> Presidential Library foundation. The red border that rings the ship's seal {{is similar to}} the distinctive red rim that defines the White House china designed for <b>the</b> <b>Reagans</b> during their <b>White</b> House years. Four gold stars represent President Reagan's 40thpresidency and his four pillars of freedom: individual liberty, economic opportunity, global democracy, and national pride. [...] "Peace through Strength" [...] was a recurring theme of the President's life in public service. The aircraft carrier is positioned by the West Coast, representing President Reagan's two terms as Governor of California and the ship's homeport in the Pacific Fleet. The three aircraft with their patriotic contrails symbolize the three major military operations the President directed during his tenure: Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada/1983), Operation El Dorado Canyon (Libya/1986), and Operation Praying Mantis (Iran/1988). The view of the globe signifies the President's vision of global democracy, and the center is the United States representing the country's national pride. Colors of red, white, and blue dominate the seal reflecting the American flag.|$|R

He made frequent visits to <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House and traveled on the lecture circuit. The re-release of his Hitchcock films gained Stewart renewed recognition. Rear Window and Vertigo were particularly praised by film critics, which helped bring these pictures {{to the attention of}} younger movie-goers.

2500|$|The Anti-Defamation League {{has called}} Buchanan an [...] "unrepentant bigot" [...] who [...] "repeatedly demonizes Jews and {{minorities}} and openly affiliates with white supremacists." [...] "There's no doubt," [...] said Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, [...] "he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice." [...] Buchanan denies {{that he is}} antisemitic, {{and a number of}} his journalistic colleagues, including Murray Rothbard, Justin Raimondo, [...] Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. As a member of <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>White</b> House, he is accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that [...] "there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world." [...] Furthermore, on The McLaughlin Group Buchanan has also made such comments as “‘Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory’ and ‘If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at…’” ...|$|E

Silicon has promoted improvements both in quantitative and qualitative aspects when supplied to some ornamental species produced in these conditions. We evaluated the response of chrysanthemum cultivars grown in pots to the application of silicon. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Treatments were arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial scheme (three cultivars of chrysanthemum: Coral Charm, <b>White</b> <b>Reagan</b> and Indianapolis and two doses of silicon: 0 and 800 mg kg- 1) with six replications, in an entirely randomized design. We evaluated the diameter of the flower buds and stems; length of the flower stems; height of the plants; dry matter production of roots, leaves, stems, inflorescence and shoots; total number of inflorescences; diameter of the most fully open inflorescences; Si content in the leaf tissue; and flowering cycle and shelf life. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>Reagan</b> cultivar produced <b>the</b> greatest number of inflorescences (29. 17) per pot and proved to be more precocious (85. 83 days).
