40|$|Fibre metal {{laminates}} (FML) are {{the modern}} hybrid materials with potential {{wide range of}} applications in aerospace technology due to their excellent mechanical properties (particularly fatigue strength, resistance <b>to</b> <b>impacts)</b> and also excellent corrosion resistance. The study describes the resistance <b>to</b> low velocity <b>impacts</b> in Ti/CFRP laminates. Tested laminates were produced in autoclave process. The laminates were characterized {{in terms of their}} response <b>to</b> <b>impacts</b> in specified energy range (5 J, 10 J, 20 J). The tests were performed in accordance with ASTM D 7137 standard. The laminates were subjected <b>to</b> <b>impacts</b> by means of hemispherical impactor with diameter of 12, 7 mm. The following values have been determined: impact force vs. time, maximum force and the force at which the material destruction process commences (Pi). It has been found that fibre titanium laminates are characterized by high resistance <b>to</b> <b>impacts.</b> This feature is associated with elasto-plastic properties of metal and high rigidity of epoxy - fibre composite. It has been observed that Ti/CFRP laminates are characterized by more instable force during impact in stage of stabilization of impactor-laminate system and stage of force growth that glass fibre laminates. It has been observed more stable force decrease in stage of stress relaxation and withdrawal of the impactor. In energy range under test, the laminates based on titanium with glass and carbon fibres reinforcement demonstrate similar and high resistance <b>to</b> low-velocity <b>impact,</b> measured by means of failure initiation force and impact maximum force...|$|R
