5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the bogies. The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives had <b>too</b> <b>high</b> fuel consumption and the bogies had faults, as they had <b>too</b> <b>high</b> track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also had problems with overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the oil cooler and the brakes. The on-board computer failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E

5|$|After {{a poorly}} {{received}} test screening, in which Lynch believes he had mixed the soundtrack at <b>too</b> <b>high</b> a volume, the director cut twenty minutes of footage from the film, bringing its length to 89 minutes.

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure is believed to have struck half eagles first for that reason, after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, was <b>too</b> <b>high</b> in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E

All such varieties, which were reserved for exclusive production in the hand loom sector, are now extensively and widely produced in power looms making the hand loom products not competitive in the market.|$|R

5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining was <b>too</b> <b>high</b> {{a price to pay}} for the actual benefits gained at high speed.
