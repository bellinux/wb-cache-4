Production of gas started in 1986, and it was operated and owned by Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc.

40|$|Background and Aims: To examine factors {{associated}} with transition from non-injecting <b>to</b> <b>injecting</b> routes of drug administration and testing antibody positive to hepatitis C virus (HCV) among ethnic Vietnamese heroin users in Melbourne, Australia. Methods: In a cross-sectional convenience survey, sample recruited by peer-workers using snowball sampling technique with a finger prick blood collection. Two-hundred ethnic Vietnamese heroin users were recruited and interviews conducted mainly in Footscray, an area of high ethnic Vietnamese residency with a prominent street based drug market. A structured questionnaire was administered. Measures included patterns of drug use, transition from smoking <b>to</b> <b>injecting</b> and vice versa, injection related risk behaviours and HCV sero-status. Results: Ninety-three {{percent of the sample}} commenced drug use by non-injecting routes of administration. More than a half had made the transition from smoking <b>to</b> <b>injecting</b> and almost two thirds of participants had ever injected. The {{factors associated}} with making this transition included being male and a longer duration of use. Prevalence of exposure to HCV among injectors was over 50 %. Factors associated with being HCV positive were longer duration of injecting, sharing injecting equipment and being older. Conclusions: Smoking heroin is a common route of drug administration among heroin users of Vietnamese ethnicity in this study. The transition from smoking <b>to</b> <b>injecting</b> was very common in the sample. The need for targeted harm reduction initiatives is indicated, and these must take into account patterns of heroin use as well as the social context of drug use if we are to work effectively with heroin users of Vietnamese ethnicity...|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium <b>to</b> <b>inject</b> toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E

5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value.

40|$|To assess {{relationships}} between characteristics of methadone maintenance treatment and long-term cessation of injecting (> or = 1 year). The incidence of cessation of injecting and relapse from non-injecting <b>to</b> <b>injecting</b> was estimated among 488 participants of the Amsterdam cohort study among drug users. We used a nested matched case-control design to identify methadone treatment characteristics significantly and independently related <b>to</b> cessation of <b>injecting.</b> <b>To</b> ensure detailed and valid assessment of methadone treatment, {{data of the}} Central Methadone Register were linked with cohort data. For 339 of 488 subjects of the initial study group methadone data were available. The incidence of cessation of injecting increased from 2. 2 / 100 person years in 1985 - 89 to 5. 5 / 100 per year in 1995 - 97 (Ptrend = 0. 005). Relapse <b>to</b> <b>injecting</b> was high: 17. 2 / 100 person years (no trend). Methadone dosage and frequency of methadone programme attendance in themselves were not significantly related <b>to</b> cessation of <b>injecting.</b> However, an individual increase of 5 mg or more per year (OR 4. 20, 95 % CI 1. 54 - 11. 46) and receiving methadone mainly via the outpatient clinic for drug-abusing prostitutes and foreigners (OR 0. 18, 95 % CI 0. 05 - 0. 59) were independent predictors of cessation of injecting.
