5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E

State and municipal laws, including those <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> alcoholic beverages, apply in all territorial waters which includes inland rivers, lakes, and bays, and tidal waters up to three nautical miles from the New Jersey shoreline.|$|E

5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E

Section 5 of Article IX prohibits such foreign corporations from doing anything in Virginia that a Virginia corporation could not do.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E

5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the nucleus}} {{is the site}} of transcription, it also {{contains}} a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> expression.|$|E

5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved is secondary to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes <b>that</b> <b>regulate</b> the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential tether is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response.|$|E
