5|$|The most {{difficult}} scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession {{about what to}} wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences {{when he was at}} a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.|$|E
5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet within minutes of the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg, shattering the bone. Corbet was brought below to the ship's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound, and command devolved on Lieutenant John Crew Tullidge. At 02:30, Astrée pulled away from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée and found herself assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E

5|$|Connections among Coolbrith's {{circle of}} friends {{resulted}} in a librarian job at San Francisco's Mercantile Library Association in 1898, and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco. In January 1899, artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which Keith and Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia, a book of poems by Daniel O'Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less than she had been earning in Oakland, but her duties were light enough <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> devote {{a greater proportion of}} her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis's The Land of Sunshine magazine. As a personal project, she began to work on a history of California literature.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped the water out of the hold, repairing the ship so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E

They lived at 1 avenue Malakoff (now avenue Raymond Poincaré) in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, in an apartment overlooking the place du Trocadéro. The marriage did nothing to reduce her activism.

25|$|The {{mountain}} {{is the scene}} of several mythic events {{in the works of}} Homer. At its summit, the Olympian gods gathered to watch the progress of the epic fight.

25|$|On 12 August 2008, Komsomolskaya Pravda {{reported}} that in South Ossetia several soldiers were wounded and one was killed, who were from Tatarstan. Five days {{before he was killed}} in South Ossetia, Evgeny Parfenov warned his parents not to call him because {{it would be hard to}} reach him by phone. Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he could see how the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> call her son for the last time at around 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the Dragon-Blooded in Creation make up the ruling class of the Realm, currently the most powerful empire in Creation. The state-sanctioned faith known as the Immaculate Order paints the Solar and Lunar Exalted as dangerous Anathema who will bring ruin to the world if allowed to exist. Because of this, the Realm organizes the Wyld Hunt, which actively seeks out newly Exalted Celestials (Solars and Lunars, although they also hunt Abyssals and fair folk as well) and overwhelms them before they can master their new powers. This practice, which had effectively kept the Solars from rising to power again {{since the end of}} the First Age, has faltered in the recent Exalted timeline because of the disappearance of the Scarlet Empress and the stability and leadership <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> bring to the Dragon-Blooded. The power struggle by the great Dragon-Blooded houses to fill the resulting power vacuum has destabilized the Realm and allowed the Solar Exalted to escape the purges of the Wyld Hunt and rise in Creation once more.|$|E
500|$|As she {{had started}} to do in her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and {{continued}} throughout her series, Angelou upholds the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At {{the same time she}} makes a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou had matured as a writer by the time she wrote Traveling Shoes, to the point <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play with the form and structure of the work. [...] As in her previous books, it consists of a series of anecdotes connected by theme. [...] She depicts her struggle with being the mother of a grown son, and with her place in her new home.|$|E

Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and that kind of stuff. She was really in the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process".

500|$|Around {{the start}} of 2003, the Schindlers began to create more {{publicity}} by lobbying for their case to keep their daughter alive. They selected pro-life activist Randall Terry as their spokesman and continued to pursue their available legal options. On September 11, 2003, the Schindlers petitioned the court to forestall removal of the feeding tube to provide for [...] "eight weeks' therapy". Accompanying the petition were four affidavits {{from members of the}} Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing, the Schindlers' counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses. In particular, Nurse Carla Sauer lyer asserted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> feed Terri Schiavo orally but that Michael characterized any such interaction as [...] "therapy" [...] and ordered her not to do so. Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, [...] "Do what Michael Schiavo tells you or you're terminated," [...] and that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she [...] "would call them anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies chose the name Rose because he considered it a [...] "good luck charm" [...] after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. His desire to make the show [...] "essentially British" [...] was another justification: he considered Rose to be [...] "the most British name in the world" [...] and feminine enough to subvert a recent trend of female companions having [...] "boyish" [...] names, such as Peri, Benny, Charley, and Ace. Davies also frequently uses the surname [...] "Tyler" [...] in his work—previous characters he created with the surname include Ruth Tyler in Revelations (1994), Vince Tyler in Queer as Folk (1999), and Johnny Tyler in The Second Coming (2003)—due to his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced. The casting of Piper as Rose was announced on by the BBC on 24 May 2004. Head of Drama for BBC Wales Julie Gardner commented that the former pop star [...] "fits the bill perfectly" [...] as a [...] "unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston". Whilst some fans—including {{a representative of the}} Doctor Who Appreciation Society—were enthusiastic about the announcement, others felt it was [...] "publicity stunt" [...] casting and questioned Piper's acting credentials. One of the factors that influenced Piper's acceptance of the role was <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> relate the character of Rose to her own experiences as a teenager.|$|E

[...] As a result of her work, [...] "for the first time Australian teenagers saw that two Australians they knew [...] reporting on the English music scene." [...] The pair then travelled to America to cover the Monterey International Pop Festival (mid-June 1967), before returning to Australia.
