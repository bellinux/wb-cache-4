T. evansi was isolated in mice by inoculation with the cryopreserved buffy coat of parasitologically confirmed animals. Fourteen stocks were thus isolated and subject to genotyping with PCRs targeting type-specific variant surface glycoprotein genes, mitochondrial minicircles and maxicircles, minisatellite markers and the F 1 -ATP synthase γ subunit gene. Nine stocks corresponded to type A, two stocks were type B and three stocks represented mixed infections between A and B, but not hybrids. One T. evansi type A stock was completely akinetoplastic. Five stocks were adapted to in vitro culture and subjected to a drug sensitivity assay with melarsomine dihydrochloride, diminazene diaceturate, isometamidium chloride and suramin. In vitro adaptation induced some loss of kinetoplasts within 60 days. No correlation between drug sensitivity and absence of the kinetoplast was observed.

40|$|Background Surra, a vector borne disease {{caused by}} <b>Trypanosoma</b> (T.) <b>evansi,</b> affects the health, {{productivity}} and working capacity of camels. Since clinical signs are not pathognomonic, diagnosis must {{be confirmed by}} laboratory methods. This is a first study on the prevalence of surra in Cholistan Desert, Pakistan using a broad variety of diagnostic tests thereby emphasizing it as a risk for the dromedaries of Pakistan. Methods In a cross sectional study, 1005 dromedary camels from three districts in the Cholistan Desert were sampled to assess the prevalence of trypanosomosis due to T. evansi by means of parasitological (Giemsa stained thin smear), serological (formol gel test, CATT/T. evansi, ELISA/VSG RoTat 1. 2, immune trypanolysis) and molecular tests (TBR 1 / 2 PCR and RoTat 1. 2 PCR). Kappa was calculated to assess the degree of agreement between different tests whereas chi-square test along with odds ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals were used to study influence of breed, gender, age and locality on disease prevalence. Results Overall prevalence was 0. 7 % with Giemsa stained thin smears (GST), 40. 1 % with formol gel test (FGT), 47. 7 % with CATT/T. evansi, 44. 2 % with ELISA/VSG RoTat 1. 2, 39. 9 % with immune trypanolysis (TL), 31. 9 % with TBR 1 / 2 PCR and 30. 5 % with RoTat 1. 2 PCR. Based on these results, the Cholistan Desert {{appears to be a}} high risk area for surra. According to TL and TBR 1 / 2 PCR, camels at Bahawalpur are approximately two {{times more likely to be}} infected than those in Bahawalnagar (OR[*]=[*] 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 38 - 2. 42) and Rahim Yar Khan (OR[*]=[*] 1. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 30 - 2. 75). Test agreement of TL was moderate with CATT/T. evansi (k[*]=[*] 0. 43; 95 % CI: 0. 378 - 0. 489) and ELISA/VSG RoTat 1. 2 (k[*]=[*] 0. 54; 95 % CI: 0. 489 - 0. 594) and poor with the other tests. Test agreement between TBR 1 / 2 PCR and RoTat 1. 2 PCR was almost perfect (k[*]=[*] 0. 96; 95 % CI: 0. 950 - 0. 984). We didn't find evidence for the presence of T. evansi type B in the studied population. Conclusion Our study supports using antibody detection tests, rather than parasitological and molecular examination, to assess surra prevalence in camels. It also calls for implementation of measures to control surra in the Cholistan Desert. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|<b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>evansi</b> is a blood {{protozoan}} parasite of {{the genus}} Trypanosoma {{which is responsible for}} surra (Trypanosomosis) in domestic and wild animals. This study addressed apoptotic-like features in <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>evansi</b> in vitro. The mechanism of parasite death was investigated using staurosporine as an inducing agent. We evaluated its effects through several cytoplasmic features of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure, maintenance of plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial trans-membrane potential. For access to these features we have used the flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with cultures in the stationary phase and adjusted to a density of 10 (6) cells/mL. The apoptotic effect of staurosporine in T. evansi was evaluated at 20 nM final concentration. There was an increase of phosphatidylserine exposure, whereas mitochondrial potential was decreased. Moreover, no evidence of cell permeability increasing with staurosporine was observed in this study, suggesting the absence of a necrotic process. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the possible pathways associated with this form of cell death in this hemoparasite...|$|E
40|$|We {{have had}} so many reports of studies in {{pathological}} anatomy of trypanosomiasis, but none, so far as I know, analyzing the pathological changes of trypanosomac septicaemia on the ground of allergy theory. The purpose of this studies is to throw light upon the infection of surra trypanosomes. This report deals with the histological findings of male genitals of rabbits infected with <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>evansi...</b>|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} two blood samples from symptomatically {{infected}} camels were examined. Among these 14 (13. 72 %) samples were positive for <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>evansi.</b> A higher infection {{was found in}} females (15. 68 %) as compared to males (11. 76 %). Higher (17. 64 %) infection was noted in males above 4 years of age compared with 5. 88 % in animals under 3 to 4 years of age...|$|E
40|$|The ultrastructural {{study in}} {{different}} tissues of mice experimentally infected with isolates of <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>evansi,</b> Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana reveals changes in cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle fibers and hepatic, adrenal, kidney and spleen cells. Some were cytoarchitectural changes and other consisted of necrosis. Alterations {{were also found}} in microvasculature. The mononuclear cell infiltrate included neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages. This work shows that various mice tissues are important target for trypanosomatids...|$|E
