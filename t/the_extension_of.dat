40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} characterizing the set ε(P) <b>of</b> all <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> an order P {{on a set of}} elements E, where |E|=n, |P|=m and μ is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order. Initially, we describe two distinct characterizations of ε(P). The first characterization is a one-to-one correspondence between <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P and pairs of upsets and downsets of certain suborders of P. The second one characterizes <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P in terms <b>of</b> linear <b>extensions</b> and sequences <b>of</b> downsets. Both characterizations lead to algorithms that generate all <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P. Further, we discuss the notion of passive pairs of an order. Based on it, we describe a third characterization of ε(P) and an algorithm that generates all <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> P in O(n) amortized time per extension...|$|R
5|$|The {{first section}} of the freeway opened in 1963, east of I-805. <b>The</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the freeway west to I-5 was delayed in order to {{coincide}} with the construction of the flood channel for the Sweetwater River. While construction started in 1984, a court stopped the process for a few years, and this portion was not complete until 1992. The final section of freeway, which was upgraded from an expressway, opened in 2007, to coincide with <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> SR125 south to Otay Mesa.|$|E
