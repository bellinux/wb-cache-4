5|$|In January 2005, three granite benches, {{built by}} a college classmate of one of <b>the</b> <b>astronauts,</b> were {{installed}} at the site on {{the southern edge of}} the launch pad. Each bears the name of one of <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> and his military service insignia.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on <b>the</b> <b>astronauts,</b> on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E
5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> gained hands-on experience. In addition to piloting the spacecraft, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. <b>The</b> <b>astronauts</b> traveled from the Grand Canyon to learn about geography {{all the way to}} Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> {{would leave}} <b>the</b> vehicle {{in a space}} suit, climb inside the plastic bag, and then fill it with foam. The bag had {{the shape of a}} blunt cone, with <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> {{embedded}} in its base facing outward. The rocket pack would protrude from the bag and be used to slow <b>the</b> <b>astronaut's</b> orbital speed enough so that they would reenter Earth's atmosphere, and the foam-filled bag would act as insulation during the subsequent aerobraking. Finally, once <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> had descended to 30000 ft where the air was sufficiently dense, the parachute would automatically deploy and slow <b>the</b> <b>astronaut's</b> fall to 17 mph. The foam heat shield would serve a final role as cushioning when <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> touched down and as a flotation device should they land on water. The radio beacon would guide rescuers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During a 10 day {{taxiflight}} to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004, Dutch astronaut André Kuipers {{is scheduled}} to test a multi-purpose vibrotactile vest. The main application of the vest is supporting <b>the</b> <b>astronaut’s</b> orientation awareness. To this end, we employ an artificial gravity vector analogy. The location of vibration on the torso indicates {{the direction of a}} vector representing the standard ISS orientation. This application is hypothesised to increase <b>the</b> <b>astronaut’s</b> performance and safety. A second application is designed to be used during rest. Additional vibrating elements are attached to the ankles, knees, elbows and wrists of <b>the</b> <b>astronaut.</b> By using specific, pre-programmed spatiotemporal patterns, <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> can get <b>the</b> feeling of whole body stimulation. This will support <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> in sensing and locating his extremities in space. This application is hypothesised to compensate for the sensory deprivation of the proprioceptive system during weightlessness, resulting in increased comfort for <b>the</b> <b>astronaut.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Chaffee and Grissom {{were buried}} in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery, while White was buried at West Point Cemetery. Chaffee's widow {{received}} $100,000 {{as a part of}} the contract <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> signed with two publishing firms so they would have exclusive rights to stories and photographs of <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> and their families.

5|$|The {{second phase}} was {{contingency}} training, {{which focused on}} astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off {{in the middle of}} the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of Reno, Nevada. For clothing, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.|$|E

50|$|Chilton held {{a variety}} of {{technical}} assignments. He served in the Mission Development Branch of <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Office {{in support of the}} Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) satellite, and the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) programs. He was <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Office T-38 Talon safety officer, leader of <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center, and was lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for numerous Shuttle flights.|$|R
5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for <b>the</b> <b>astronauts.</b> This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration. <b>The</b> <b>astronauts</b> spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants {{to check on the}} progress of the hardware.|$|E
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. <b>The</b> <b>astronauts</b> used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning. This was later {{found to be}} the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.|$|E

40|$|A don/doff {{support stand}} {{for use with}} rear entry space suits is disclosed. The support stand is {{designed}} for use in one-g environments; however, certain features of the stand {{can be used on}} future space-craft, lunar or planetary bases. The present invention has a retainer which receives a protruding lug fixed on the torso section of the space suit. When the lug is locked in the retainer, the space suit is held in a generally upright position. In a one-g environment a portable ladder is positioned adjacent to the rear entry of the space suit supported by <b>the</b> stand. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> climbs up <b>the</b> ladder and grasps a hand bar assembly positioned above the rear entry. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> then slips his legs through the open rear entry and down into the abdominal portion of <b>the</b> suit. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> then lowers himself fully into the suit. The portable ladder is then removed and <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> can close <b>the</b> rear entry door. The lug is then disengaged from the retainer and <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> is free to engage in training exercises in the suit. When suit use is over, <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> returns to <b>the</b> stand and inserts the lug into the retainer. A technician repositions <b>the</b> ladder. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> opens <b>the</b> rear entry door, grasps the hand bar assembly and does a chin-up to extricate himself from <b>the</b> suit. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> climbs down <b>the</b> movable ladder while the suit is supported by the stand...|$|R

5|$|In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged {{the various}} Apollo landing {{sites on the}} surface of the Moon, for the first time with {{sufficient}} resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by <b>the</b> <b>astronauts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Launched {{from the}} EUROSEC Space Centre in Portugal in the {{spacecraft}} Phoenix, Ross and Kane spend {{the first half}} of their six-week round trip in stasis. Three weeks after launch, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> are revived in the planet's orbit. Scans for the existence of extraterrestrial life are inconclusive, and Ross and Kane decide to make a surface landing. As <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> descend, an electrical storm damages their Dove lander shuttle, which crashes in a mountainous region near Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. When an air-sea rescue unit returns Ross and Kane, the latter critically injured, to the Space Centre, it appears that the Phoenix mission has returned to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} mission countdown {{began on}} Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six {{days before the}} launch. At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. <b>The</b> <b>astronauts</b> underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11. On April 15, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants were pumped into the spacecraft, while <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.|$|E

5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. <b>The</b> <b>astronauts</b> were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{schedule}} for the mission called for <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period {{as they had been}} awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Two manned orbital Block I CSM {{missions}} were planned: AS-204 and AS-205. The Block I crew {{positions were}} titled Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot.

5|$|About {{seven minutes}} after {{stepping}} onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded {{the bag and}} tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee {{there would be some}} lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.|$|E
5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics. The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools. SM1 flew aboard Endeavour in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 16's landing {{spot in the}} {{highlands}} was chosen to allow <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> to gather geologically older lunar material than the samples obtained {{in the first four}} landings, which were in or near lunar maria.

50|$|In 2009 Peter K. Homer {{once again}} won <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Glove Challenge. Differing from the {{previous}} competition, the 2009 version of the glove was required to have a thermal micrometeorite garment, which is the outermost layer of <b>the</b> <b>astronaut's</b> glove.|$|R
50|$|The {{second level}} has a bigger maze with 13 alcoves. Walking past an alcove {{will cause a}} spider {{to come out and}} follow <b>the</b> <b>astronaut's</b> route, {{although}} at a slower pace than him. While the alcove is vacant, <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> is able to look inside the alcove. The aim is thus to take the spider on a long journey around the maze, giving <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> enough time to study the alcove and solve the puzzles within.|$|R
