5|$|Passport to Pimlico was {{released}} into UK cinemas on 26 April 1949; {{the film was}} financially successful. For the US release on 23 October 1949, soil was imported and {{placed in front of}} the cinema; commissionaires in <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> a British policeman would hand out mock passports and invite passers-by to step onto English soil to see the film.

5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> metalheads worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The first entity {{to use the}} Italian tricolour was the Cisalpine Republic in 1797, which supplanted Milan after Napoleon's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796. The colours {{chosen by}} the Cispadane Republic were red and white, which were the colours of the {{recently}} conquered flag of Milan; and green, which was the colour of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the Milanese civic guard. During this time, many small French-proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all, with variants of colour, used flags characterised by three bands of equal size, clearly inspired by the French model of 1790.|$|E
5|$|To {{their right}} is the king's nephew, prince Józef Poniatowski (34), in <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the light cavalry of the Duchy of Warsaw and riding a grey horse. The uniform is another {{instance}} of foreshadowing; Poniatowski became the commander-in-chief of the Duchy's army and {{died during the}} Battle of Leipzig. At {{the time of the}} passing of the Constitution, he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison, and is shown {{keeping an eye on the}} procession, with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street. To his right, partially obscured by Poniatowski's horse's head, is Stanisław Mokronowski (35), deputy, general, and future leader of the Kościuszko Uprising in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, {{with the}} support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was {{appointed}} an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Château d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.|$|E

Prior to World War II, each college ran its ROTC program as an independent organization with National guidelines. Each college designed its own uniforms and insignia to promote esprit de corps. Once an ROTC cadet graduated and received a military commission, then the new officer would wear <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> his or her respective branch. After World War II, ROTC programs were modified, ending college-specific uniforms for non-military colleges, and allowing cadets to wear <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> their chosen branch.|$|E
