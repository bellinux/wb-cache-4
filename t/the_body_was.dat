Lydiard's body was recovered and a funeral service {{was held at}} Falmouth, attended by Admiral Sir Charles Cotton and large numbers of army and navy officers, {{as well as the}} local dignitaries. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later interred in the family vault at Haslemere, Surrey.|$|E
5|$|General Montgomery's {{body was}} {{recovered}} by the British on New Year's Day 1776 {{and was given}} a simple military funeral on January4, paid for by Lieutenant Governor Cramahé. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> returned to New York in 1818.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1776, the British started {{collecting}} {{bodies of}} the deceased and soon found {{the body of a}} high-ranking officer of the American colonial army. After being brought to General Carleton, an American prisoner confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> that of Richard Montgomery.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> 1.63m in height. The mummy had a {{small face}} with no {{defining}} features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; {{this may have been}} an inherited family trait, as this feature can be seen in some female mummies of the same family, as well as the mummy of his descendant, Thutmose II.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{found inside}} a plastic garbage {{bag on the}} {{shoreline}} of Deer Island in Boston, Massachusetts. A woman walking her dog discovered Bond's remains {{on the afternoon of}} June 25, 2015, when the dog stopped at the plastic bag. After <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white leggings designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside the bag. Initially, police were unsure if there would be additional bodies at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use cadaver dogs to locate any other possible remains.|$|E
5|$|Black also learns of {{the murder}} in Maryland, and connects it to the killings of four {{other women in the}} locale. Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E

5000|$|In Pinagbayanan, the {{cremation}} burials were secondary burials. In {{the first}} phase, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{let alone to}} decompose. It is then followed by a ritual performance. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> burned because, according to the belief of ancient people, the “spirit is as clean as though washed in gold" [...] once <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> set on fire.|$|R
5|$|Booth's {{body was}} {{shrouded}} {{in a blanket}} and tied {{to the side of}} an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|Bormann {{returned}} with Hitler to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 as the Red Army approached the city. After Hitler committed suicide, Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture by the Soviets. Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> buried nearby on 8 May 1945, {{but was not}} found and confirmed as Bormann's until 1972. Bormann was tried in absentia by the International Military Tribunal in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 and 1946. He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging.|$|E
5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E
50|$|At many {{institutions}} {{the person responsible}} for handling, cleaning, and moving <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> called a diener, the German word for servant. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technologist who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and reconstruction after the autopsy. After <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> received, it is first photographed. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes and their position on <b>the</b> <b>body</b> before they <b>are</b> removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint or other material is collected from the external surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Ultraviolet light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of hair, nails and the like <b>are</b> taken, and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> may also <b>be</b> radiographically imaged. Once the external evidence <b>is</b> collected, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> removed from <b>the</b> bag, undressed, and any wounds present <b>are</b> examined. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination. The scale used to weigh <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> often designed to accommodate the cart that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> transported on; its weight is then deducted from the total weight shown to give the weight of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If {{the death}} {{occurs in a}} hospital, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> taken to <b>the</b> funeral parlor or home before the funeral. In {{preparation}} for cremation (usually the day before or day of <b>the</b> cremation), <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> first washed while those present recite the Gurmantar Waheguru or Mool Mantar. Then <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> lovingly dressed with clean clothes complete with the Five Ks (in case of baptized Sikhs).|$|R

5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, perhaps {{as a gesture of}} reconciliation. According to the life of Oswald, Edward's body was found to be incorrupt when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign). <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey, a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} in to investigate, as the victim's {{description}} seems {{similar to those of}} other victims of a lonely hearts killer still at large. Scully attempts to perform an autopsy on Lauren's body, only to find that it has liquified with only a skeleton remaining. Scully later discerns that the substance coating <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> a concentrated digestive enzyme, and that the remains are lacking in body fat.|$|E
50|$|Jason {{does not}} realise <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> his mother's until he asks the paramedics who <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is,</b> {{to which they}} confirm that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> that of Heidi. A devastated Jason then returns home to find Riley attacking Silas, kicking and {{punching}} him. Silas then is arrested for the murders he committed, and the village holds a memorial for all of Silas's victims, including Rae Wilson, Rebecca Massey, India Longford.|$|R

5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|His {{funeral was}} {{one of the largest in}} the South. Davis was first entombed at the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. In 1893, Mrs. Davis decided to have his remains reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. After the remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly {{organized}} Louisiana Historical Association, with many mourners passing by the casket, including Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> placed on a Louisville and Nashville Railroad car and transported to Richmond, Virginia. A continuous cortège, day and night, accompanied his body from New Orleans to Richmond. He is interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{testimony}} of survivors, the executions were carried out in groups and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> then taken by truck to the old cemetery, where <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> burned and then deposited in mass graves.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> wormlike: legless, elongate, cylindrical, and annulated. There are sunken lateral lines. The short conical tail lacks autotomy. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{short and}} stout {{relative}} to other legless lizards. Both sexes lack pre-anal pores.|$|R

5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the Iron Age. Later radiocarbon dating confirmed <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> not Gunnhild, {{but rather a}} woman of the early Iron Age who lived about 490 BC. Though no one proved the Haraldskær Woman has any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|In July 1929, the Politburo {{agreed to}} replace the {{temporary}} mausoleum with a permanent granite alternative, which was finished in 1933.

From 1941 to 1945 <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> moved from Moscow and stored in Tyumen for safety amid the Second World War. As of 2017 the body remains on public display in Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square.|$|E
50|$|In August 2015 {{fishermen}} in Burundi living {{around the lake}} in the Muyinga Province recovered over 40 unidentified <b>bodies</b> floating in <b>the</b> lake.
