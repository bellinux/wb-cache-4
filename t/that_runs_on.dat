5|$|M-124 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> {{the north side of}} Vineyard and Wamplers lakes near Brooklyn in Jackson County near the Irish Hills area. The highway travels directly through W. J. Hayes State Park before ending in Lenawee County. The designation was created in 1929 for a road that accessed the state park, connecting it to US Highway 112 (US112, now US12). It was later extended westward to M-50 in Brooklyn in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Most {{software}} <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> Linux can run on FreeBSD {{using an}} optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer {{is not an}} emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E
5|$|The party {{returns to}} Alexandria to install Garnet as queen, but are {{assaulted}} at her coronation by Kuja. Garnet and Eiko summon an eidolon to combat Kuja's; when Kuja {{tries to take}} control of their eidolon, he is stopped by an old man named Garland, who then uses Kuja's ship to destroy Garnet's eidolon and damage the city. Kuja flees with the intent to fight Garland for power. Seeking to stop both of them, the party gets an experimental airship from Cid <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> steam rather than Mist, which will allow them to journey to the other continents. Chasing Kuja, they find a portal to the parallel world of Terra; there they discover that Terra is dying, and its people created Garland to orchestrate merging the two worlds. Garland in turn created Genomes, self-aware soulless beings which would be taken over by Terran souls after the merging. The Iifa Tree serves to block Gaian souls from leaving Gaia but letting Terran souls in to be reborn into the Genomes, with the Gaian souls transformed into the Mist. Kuja and Zidane are Genomes, and Kuja turned against Garland to avoid being taken over {{at the conclusion of the}} plan. Kuja kills Garland with his newly gained powers, then destroys Terra as the party flees to Gaia with the Genomes.|$|E
