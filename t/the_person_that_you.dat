40|$|Adjective Clauses, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 15 Adjective Clauses: Do They Define or Tell Us More Information? The purpose of this lesson is to explain several characteristics of Adjective Clauses. ADJECTIVE CLAUSES are word groups with Subjects-Verb Combinations that describe nouns. Adjective Clauses are found after the nouns that they describe. Adjective Clause Connectors always stand for the noun that the clause describes, and they are always found {{at the beginning of}} the clause. However, the Connector can actually be either the subject of the Clause or the object of the Clause. In the following two examples, the Adjective Clause Connector is the word that in both sentences, and in both sentences the connector stands for ‘the student’. However, in the first sentence that is the subject of the Adjective Clause. In the second sentence, that is the object of the Adjective Clause. I ran into a student that saw you at the game. I ran into a student that you saw at the game. In both sentences, that refers to the ‘student’ and that comes {{at the beginning of the}} Clause. Notice, however, in the first sentence, ‘the student saw you’, and in the second sentence, ‘you saw the student’. Another distinction is whether the noun is a person or a thing. The Connector that can be used for either persons or things. In place of that, the Connector who can be used for persons, and the Connector which can be used for things. The following examples illustrate this difference. I went to a game which you saw on television. I met a famous person who you saw on television. The Connector ‘that’ could be used in place of both ‘which’ and ‘who’. (The connector whom can be used in place of who, but it is not used often in modern English.) When dealing with Adjective Clauses, the student needs to recognize the Subject-Verb Combinations of both the Main Clause and the Adjective Clause. Adjective Clauses can describe both Subjects and Objects of Main Clauses. This is illustrated with these sentences: The book which you read is a best seller. (‘book’ is the subject of the Main Clause.) I read the book which you recommended. (‘book’ is the object of the Main Clause.) This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 One more distinction is important to know about Adjective Clauses. Some Adjective Clauses define the noun that they follow. Other adjective clauses describe the nouns that they follow without defining them. Look at these examples: I met the person who you saw on television. I met Nelson Mandela, who you saw on television. In the first sentence, the person is defined by the Clause. The Clause tells us what person ‘I met’. In the second sentence, ‘I met Nelson Mandela’. He is already known. That you saw Nelson Mandela on television is just additional information. The first sentence has a Defining Adjective Clause. The second sentence has a Non-Defining Adjective Clause. There are a few things to notice about the Connectors in these two sentences. In the first sentence, you can use that in place of who. You can also delete the Connector and use no connector at all. Both of the following sentences are grammatical. I met <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> saw on television. I met the person you saw on television. (no clause connector.) If you try to make similar sentences about Nelson Mandela, they would be grammatically incorrect. Both of these sentences are ungrammatical. I met Nelson Mandela, that you saw on television. I met Nelson Mandela, you saw on television. (no clause connector) Defining Adjective Clauses are very closely tied to the Nouns they define, and commas are usually not used with them. Non-Defining Adjective Clauses are not so closely tied to the Nouns they describe, and they are usually separated from the Main Clause with commas...|$|E

The tradition was brought over by Polynesian voyagers sailing from Tahiti. In the past, maile leis, {{known as one of}} the most sacred leis, was used in peace agreements between opposing peoples. In addition to wearing the lei as a source of beautification, the lei was a way to distinguish groups of people from one another. The lei comes with a set of unspoken rules such as wearing it over your shoulders, not removing it while around <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> gave <b>you</b> <b>the</b> lei, and refusing a lei is seen as disrespectful.

And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't.

5000|$|Gordon {{developed}} a social/psychological theory that, {{thanks to the}} telephone, people can feel free to exhibit two personalities - one for everyday life conversation and another goal directed personality for business and professional exchange.

[...] "On the phone, you are able to become <b>the</b> very best <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can possibly be," [...] Gordon said.

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and <b>the</b> only <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again.
