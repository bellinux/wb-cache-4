40|$|Abstract. Polymerization of β-pinene was {{investigated}} {{in the presence of}} various Keggin phosphotungstates. The experiments show that cetyltrimethylammonium phosphotungstate with molar ratio of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide to phosphotungstatic acid equal to 0. 5 indicate efficient catalytic performance for the polymerization of β-pinene. The catalyst was easily removed from reaction mixture by filtration. Therefore, a clean and environmental friendly strategy for synthesis of <b>terpene</b> <b>resin</b> is developed...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to study the {{cationic}} polymerisation of terpenes, particularly of -pinene, with alkylaluminium catalysts. Some experiments at different polymerisation temperatures (10, 20 and 50 ºC) were carried out with ethylaluminium dichloride catalyst, C 2 H 5 AlCl 2. From the results, {{it is possible to}} draw some general conclusions about the evolution of chain growth during polymerisation. This also includes the influence of reaction temperature upon some properties of the final resin, particularly the molecular weight distribution, the softening point and the Gardner colour index. The role of reducing agents, such as iodine, during the distillation of the final resin is also evaluated with respect to colour and softening point. As a result of this investigation, the Mark-Howink constants for <b>terpene</b> <b>resins</b> in toluene and dicloromethane as solvents have also been experimentally determined, thus allowing a more precise use of SEC in the characterisation of such natural based products...|$|R
40|$|Label from 14 CO 2 and [2 - 14 C]mevalonic acid was {{incorporated}} into resin components of Newcastelia viscida.

40|$|The Hymenaea {{courbaril}} var. stilbocarpa wood has a {{high density}} being employed in construction, carpentry and laminate. The stem exudes a rich <b>terpene</b> <b>resin</b> {{which can be used}} in the varnish industry. The endocarp of the fruit is edible and can be eaten raw. The chromosomal duplication of forest species aims to maximize economic interest features, such as those related to the development and forest gain. This study aimed to induce and verify polyploidy in root meristem cells of Hymenaea courbaril through morphological and cytological features. To induce polyploidy, the root meristems were exposed to the trifluralin herbicide at a concentration of 3 μM at 4 ºC for 14 (control), 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Then, the rootlets were stored for 24 h in a closed flask and refrigerated in methanol: acetic acid solution (high purity) in the ratio 3 : 1, at - 4 ºC. Root meristems were digested in pectinase enzyme (SigmaTM). Mitotic cells were obtained by cell dissociation, air drying and hotplate. 30 cells in metaphase were colored with Giemsa 5 % and analyzed. The stomata were obtained from young plantlets of each treatment under the same physical and chemical conditions. For stomata analysis, was used epidermal print of adaxial leaf, with universal instant adhesive (Super BonderTM). 200 stomata were analyzed of each treatment. Among the four treatments evaluated, the exposure of root meristem for 96 h in 3 μM trifluralin, at 4 ºC, induced genome duplication in Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa with 2 n = 4 x = 48 chromosomes and stomata average size of 0. 215 mm, being superior to the other treatments...|$|E

The study also employed an in vivo evaluation of the hepatotoxic effect of methanolic extract in male albino mice at different concentrations (500 and 1000 mg / kg) given orally for 7 days including biochemical functions SGPT, SGOT and SALP, bilirubin and histopathlogical changes. At day 8 the animal was sacrificed by anesthetic ether and the liver is weighed and kept in 10 % formalin for preparation of histopathological sections. The serum was isolated from the blood for the biochemical tests. Statistical results showed the absence of any significant changes on body weight and liver weight of nutmeg treated mice. However nutmeg treated mice showed statistically significant alteration in the biochemical indicators of liver function including significant elevation in SGPT, SGOT, SALP and TSB in a dose dependent manner.

40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, {{is a significant}} pest of lodgepole pine in British Columbia (BC), where it has recently reached an unprecedented outbreak level. Although it is native to western North America, the beetle can now {{be viewed as a}} native invasive because {{for the first time in}} recorded history it has begun to reproduce in native jack pine stands within the North American boreal forest. The ability of jack pine trees to defend themselves against mass attack and their suitability for brood success will play a major role in the success of this insect in a putatively new geographic range and host. Lodgepole and jack pine were sampled along a transect extending from the beetle’s historic range (central BC) to the newly invaded area east of the Rocky Mountains in north-central Alberta (AB) in Canada for constitutive phloem <b>resin</b> <b>terpene</b> levels. In addition, two populations of lodgepole pine (BC) and one population of jack pine (AB) were sampled for levels of induced phloem <b>terpenes.</b> Phloem <b>resin</b> <b>terpenes</b> were identified and quantified using gas chromatography. Significant differences were found in constitutive levels of terpenes between the two species of pine. Constitutive α-pinene levels – a precursor in the biosynthesis of components of the aggregation and antiaggregation pheromones of {{mountain pine}} beetle – were significantly higher in jack pine. However, lower constitutive levels of compounds known to be toxic to bark beetles, e. g., 3 -carene, in jack pine suggests that this species could be poorly defended. Differences in wounding-induced responses for phloem accumulation of five major terpenes were found between the two populations of lodgepole pine and between lodgepole and jack pine. The mountain pine beetle will face a different constitutive and induced phloem <b>resin</b> <b>terpene</b> environment when locating and colonizing jack pine in its new geographic range, and this may play a significant role in the ability of the insect to persist in this new host...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this work}} was to study the Altar Machine in the Church Mother of Gangi, a little town near Palermo (Italy) {{regarding}} the history, the technical manufacture, the constitutive materials {{and the state of}} preservation. The Altar Machine was dated back to {{the second half of the}} 18 th century; it is constituted by carved and painted wood, a complex system of winch and pulleys allows move various statues and parts of the Machine in accordance with the baroque scenography machineries. Results The observation and survey of the mechanisms allowed formulate hypothesis on a more ancient mode of operation of the Altar Machine. Laboratory analysis revealed the presence of many superimposed layers constituted by several different materials (protein binders, siccative oils, natural <b>terpene</b> <b>resins,</b> shellac, calcium carbonate, gypsum, lead white, brass, zinc white, iron oxides) and different wood species employed for the original and restoration elements of the Machine. This is due to a continuous usage of the object that has got a demo-ethno-anthropological significance. Microclimate monitoring (relative humidity RH and temperature T) put in evidence that most of the data fall outside the tolerance intervals, i. e. the RH and T limits defined by the international standards. In particular, T values were generally high (out of the tolerance range) but they appeared to be quite constant; on the other hand RH values fell almost always inside the tolerance area but they often exhibited dangerous variations. Conclusions The characterization of the constitutive materials provided useful information both to support the dating of the Machine proposed by the inscription and to obtain a base of data for a possible conservation work. The microclimate monitoring put in evidence that the temperature and relative humidity values are not always suitable to correctly preserve the artefact. The careful in situ investigation confirmed an on-going climate induced damage to the Altar Machine that, associated to the deterioration caused by its usage, may have dramatic consequences on this unique and peculiar work of art. The results of this work will have potential implications in the near future regarding a probable conservation project on the Machine. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the American root-rot disease fungus Heterobasidion irregulare Garbel. & Otrosina was detected in Italian coastal pine forests (Pinus pinea L.) {{in addition to the}} common native species Heterobasidion annosum (Fries) Brefeld. High levels of tropospheric ozone (O 3) as an atmospheric pollutant are usually experienced in Mediterranean pine forests. To explore the effect of interaction between the two Heterobasidion species and ozone pollution on P. pinea, an open-top chamber (OTC) experiment was carried out. Five-year-old P. pinea seedlings were inoculated with the fungal species considered (H. irregulare, H. annosum and mock-inoculation as control), and then exposed in charcoal-filtered open-top chambers (CF-OTC) and non-filtered ozoneenriched chambers (NF+) from July to the first week of August 2010 at the experimental facilities of Curno (North Italy). Fungal inoculation effects in an ozone-enriched environment were assessed as: (i) the length of the inoculation lesion; (ii) chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) responses; and (iii) analysis of <b>resin</b> <b>terpenes.</b> Results showed no differences on lesion length between fungal and ozone treatments, whereas the short-term effects of the two stress factors on ChlF indicate an increased photosynthetic efficiency, thus suggesting the triggering of compensation/repair processes. The total amount of <b>resin</b> <b>terpenes</b> is enhanced by fungal infection of both species, but depressed by ozone to the levels observed in mock-inoculated plants. Variations in terpene profiles were also induced by stem base inoculations and ozone treatment. Ozone might negatively affect terpene defences making plants more susceptible to pathogens and insects...|$|R
50|$|Induced (traumatic) resin {{in white}} spruce leaders {{resistant}} or {{susceptible to the}} white pine weevil was analyzed for volatile <b>terpenes</b> and diterpene <b>resin</b> acids after simulated white pine weevil damage (Tomlin et al. 2000). Leaders from 331 trees were wounded just below the apical bud with a 1-mm diameter drill, coinciding with the natural time of weevil oviposition in the spring. Leaders were removed in the autumn, and the bark and xylem from {{the upper and lower}} regions of the leader extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unwounded trees had low amounts of resin in xylem compared with bark. In response to wounding, volatile <b>terpenes</b> and diterpene <b>resin</b> acids increased in the upper xylem (area of wounding), with resistant trees showing a greater increase than susceptible trees. Wounding caused monoterpenes in particular to decrease in the lower region of the leader (away from the drilled area) in greater amounts in susceptible trees than in resistant trees. In response to wounding, the proportion of monoterpene to resin acid increased in the upper and lower xylem of resistant trees, and slightly increased in the upper xylem of susceptible trees. Monoterpene-enriched resin is more fluid than constitutive resin, and probably flows more readily into oviposition cavities and larval mines, where it may kill immature weevils. Loss of resin components in the lower xylem suggested catabolism and transport of these materials to the site of wounding; however, energetic and regulatory data are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This study provides a basis for measuring the ability of a tree to undergo traumatic resinosis, which could be used to screen for resistance to white pine weevil.|$|R

Application of methyl jasmonate lead to several biochemical and anatomical changes and the results suggest that induced defenses such as formation of traumatic resin ducts, enhancement of resin flow, and increased accumulation of volatile <b>terpenes</b> and diterpene <b>resin</b> acids, all triggered by application of jasmonates, play a significant role in Norway spruce defense against multiple enemies.

40|$|Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) plants {{produce and}} {{accumulate}} a terpene-rich resin in glandular trichomes, which are abundant {{on the surface}} of the female inflorescence. Bouquets of different monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are important components of cannabis resin as they define some of the unique organoleptic properties and may also influence medicinal qualities of different cannabis strains and varieties. Transcriptome analysis of trichomes of the cannabis hemp variety 'Finola' revealed sequences of all stages of terpene biosynthesis. Nine cannabis terpene synthases (CsTPS) were identified in subfamilies TPS-a and TPS-b. Functional characterization identified mono- and sesqui-TPS, whose products collectively comprise most of the <b>terpenes</b> of 'Finola' <b>resin,</b> including major compounds such as β-myrcene, (E) -β-ocimene, (-) -limonene, (+) -α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene.

40|$|Background/Question/Methods: The highly social stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are {{important}} pollinators in tropical ecosystems. Besides pollen and nectar they also collect {{large amounts of}} plant resins which they use for nest construction and defense. They further transfer resin-derived terpenes to their body surfaces, thereby increasing the diversity of their chemical profiles. We observed resin collection by stingless bees at trees and colony entrances in Borneo, to investigate whether bees collected resin from many different or only few specific trees and whether different bee species differed in or shared their preferred resin trees. Results/Conclusions: At our field site, all stingless bee species collected resin from several tree species, particularly from trees of the resinous dipterocarp family. All colonies collected a large variety of resins, suggesting that stingless bees visit several tree species rather than just a few adjacent resin wounds. Analysis of network-level specialization revealed that stingless bees are highly generalist resin collectors with no specific preferences for specific tree species but a variety of resin sources visited. Although stingless bees collect a large variety of resins, they only transfer a subset of terpenes derived from these resins to their body surface. Some species even exclude whole classes of terpenes, thereby increasing chemical differences between species and revealing a hitherto unknown ability of bees to filter <b>terpenes</b> derived from <b>resins</b> and embed them in their chemical profiles...|$|R
