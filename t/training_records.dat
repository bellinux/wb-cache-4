25|$|In 2014, {{the command}} and {{responsibility}} of the Aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) Unit at the major Port Authority airports was transferred from the Port Authority Police Department to Port Authority Aviation Department. This transfer was due to numerous and prolonged deficiencies and violations discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The results of the FAA investigation cited numerous instances where Port Authority Police did not properly maintain <b>training</b> <b>records</b> that are mandated by the FAA. The FAA also discovered numerous instances where Port Authority Police permitted untrained officers {{to be placed in}} firefighter positions. Thousands of violations were found to be occurring for many years. A Federal consent order was levied against the Port Authority which mandated numerous changes including creating a full time cadre of ARFF firefighters; removing command and control of the ARFF unit {{from the direction of the}} Port Authority Police Department; and the putting in place non-police ARFF commanding officers. While Port Authority Police officers still make up the rank and file of the ARFF Unit, command and control of the ARFF unit and emergencies is under the direction of a Port Authority Aviation Department fire chief as well as Port Authority Aviation deputy fire chiefs and fire captains assigned to each of the agency's four airports. A fire chief is also now the commanding officer at the Rescue Training Center at JFK Airport.|$|E
