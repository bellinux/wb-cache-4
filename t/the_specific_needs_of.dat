5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students {{in order to produce}} a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

He has managed $200million in Accountability Block Grants {{that were used}} for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts {{with large numbers of}} children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291million in 2008–09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274million.|$|E

40|$|M. Cur. The {{parents of}} {{premature}} babies experience tremendous anxiety and uncertainty {{when the day}} of discharge eventually dawns. These feelings are often attributed to insufficient knowledge and skills with regard to care of the baby. Parents therefore, need clear guidelines, instructions and help from the neonatal nurse. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify and prioritize <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> discharge learning <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> parents with premature babies by means of the card sorting technique as assessment method. The aim of this study is executed in two phases. In phase one, <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> learning <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> parents are identified, explored and described according to a literature study. In phase two, <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> learning <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> parents with premature babies in private hospitals are identified and prioritized by means of the card sorting technique as assessment method, in order to make recommendations for appropriate discharge education. The most important learning needs identified in this study refer to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, long term health problems of the baby, signs and symptoms of infection, and feeding. The assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> learning <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> parents with premature babies in die neonatal unit, during the discharge period, should enable the nurse to perform the necessary knowledge transfer of information and thus ensure appropriate parent preparation. Knowledge of skills is essential to enable parents to care for their babies at home with confidence. In so doing, anxiety is diminished and a content parenthood is ensured...|$|R

25|$|Improvisational Music Therapy (IMT), is {{increasing}} in popularity as a therapeutic technique being applied {{to children with}} ASD.

Some children with ASD find their different environments chaotic and confusing, therefore, IMT sessions require the presence of a certain routine and be predictable in nature, within their interactions and surroundings. Music can provide all of this, it can be very predicable, it is highly repetitious with its melodies and sounds, but easily varied with phrasing, rhythm and dynamics giving it a controlled flexibility. The allowance of parents or caregivers to sessions can put the child at ease and allow for activities to be incorporated into everyday life.|$|E

25|$|The {{museum is}} located in the town centre. It was built between 1937 and 1940 by {{architect}} Patroklos Karantinos on a site previously occupied by the Roman Catholic monastery of Saint-Francis which was destroyed by earthquake in 1856. The museum's antiseismic building is an important example of modernist architecture and was awarded a Bauhaus commendation. Karantinos applied the principles of modern architecture to <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> a museum by providing good lighting from the skylights above and {{along the top of the}} walls, and facilitating the easy flow of large groups of people. He also anticipated future extensions to the museum. The colours and construction materials, such as the veined polychrome marbles, recall certain Minoan wall-paintings which imitate marble revetment. The two-storeyed building has large exhibition spaces, laboratories, a drawing room, a library, offices and a special department, the so-called Scientific Collection, where numerous finds are stored and studied. The museum shop, run by the Archaeological Receipts Fund, sells museum copies, books, postcards and slides. There is also a café.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the skier. The ski boot for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|LW1 {{classified}} skiers use outriggers, and two skis or one ski with a prosthesis. International Ski Federation {{rules for}} ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class {{and are not}} the same rules used for able-bodied skiers. Skiers in this class are allowed to use ski-tips in competition, using a setup sometimes called a Four Track. In training, they may use additional equipment. For example, skiers with cerebral palsy may use cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis depending on the nature of their disability. Skiers with an amputation may use a prosthesis. As skiers in this classification improve, they require less use of this equipment. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight, and are customised for <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the skier. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
