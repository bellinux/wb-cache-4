40|$|Certified potato seed tuber usage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} steps for production of high yield and quality potatoes. For this reason different seed tuber production methods have been developed. Among these methods, mini tuber production is the most popular one. In order to produce mini tubers, firstly potato plants are produced in vitro, and these plants are transferred to an environmentally-controlled greenhouse. Thus, disease- and virus-free mini tubers are produced as seed tubers. However, in vitro section of mini tuber production creates problems like storage and transfer of in vitro plants, and adaptation period of the plants to greenhouse conditions. In vitro micro <b>tuber</b> (MT) <b>formation</b> has been selected as a solution of these problems.

50|$|S. subterranea is an obligate {{parasite}} slime mold that infects the below ground {{structures of the}} host. Infection leads to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the host cells and eventual bursting. However, the mechanism behind this is still unknown. Zoospores infect the root hairs by attaching to the outer surface, encysting, and then penetrating the epidermis through lenticels and stomata. Once inside, the multinucleate plasmodium divides to spread and produce more zoospores. The plasmodium causes the infected host cells to multiply rapidly and enlarge into a gall. This rapid multiplication also produces uninucleate cells that aggregate together as sporosori. The sporosori look like a powdery mass within the gall, which gives this disease its name. Eventually the gall swells and bursts out the epidermis of the tuber, releasing the spores back into the soil. Gall severity depends on inoculum level, environment, and potato skin type. Infection is most prevalent {{in the early stages}} of <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> while the potato tissue is unsuberized. But, infection can occur at all stages on development. White and red skinned potatoes and highly susceptible while russet skinned are somewhat resistant.

There is little known about variation and sexual recombination within S. subterranea, therefore high priority is given to researching the variations within potato cultivars for researching host/pathogen relationships and management.|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide, a {{contaminant}} {{classified by}} the IARC as “probably carcinogenic to humans” is formed in several heated foods and {{known to be}} linked to the Maillard reaction. Fried potato products are important in the acrylamide issue because they contain the main precursors necessary for its formation and moreover they contribute on average for {{an important part of the}} dietary exposure to this process contaminant, apart from other food commodities, including cereals products, coffee, chocolate and potato snacks. The current entrance quality control used in the French fries industry is done based on colour evaluation with USDA/Munsell colour chart. Colour is evaluated after a short frying test, typically 180 °C for 3 min. This quality control relates raw material to colour specifications of final product (customers demand) and accordingly, either raw material is rejected for processing or appropriate process adjustments are taken (e. g. blanching conditions). This study evaluated the possibility of a more effective entrance control of the raw potato tubers in order to identify lots of potatoes prone to acrylamide formation. Therefore the relationship between the sugar content of potato <b>tuber,</b> the <b>formation</b> of acrylamide and the colour of the baked product was evaluated during two consecutive potato storage seasons (2007 and 2008). The current entrance control was compared to two other colour evaluation methods (CIE L*a*b* colour parameters and a process-specific Agtron analyzer) and to reducing sugar contents determination. Even though differences were observed in reducing sugar contents in raw material for both seasons, similar trends were observed between the acrylamide content of the final product and the above-mentioned parameters. It was demonstrated that a more effective entrance control for incoming potatoes was indeed possible. Using the relationships between acrylamide and respectively colour formation (measured by the Agtron methodology) and reducing sugar content could better identify lots of potatoes prone to acrylamide formation when compared to the current entrance control. Nevertheless, the application of Agtron measurements is certainly more practical to implement and provides a better correlation to acrylamide in the final product compared to reducing sugars in the raw material...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the Crop Science Society of America and can be found at: [URL] potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) products, such as chips and French fries, contribute to the dietary intake of acrylamide, a suspected human carcinogen. One of the most promising approaches for reducing its consumption is to develop and commercialize new potato varieties with low acrylamide-forming potential. To facilitate this effort, a National Fry Processing Trial (NFPT) was conducted from 2011 to 2013 in five states. More than 140 advanced breeding lines were evaluated for tuber agronomic traits and biochemical properties from harvest through 8 mo of storage. Thirty-eight and 29 entries had significantly less acrylamide in French fries than standard varieties Russet Burbank and Ranger Russet, with reductions in excess of 50 %, after one and 8 mo of storage, respectively. As in previous studies, the glucose content of raw tubers was predictive of acrylamide in finished French fries (R² = 0. 64 – 0. 77). Despite its role in acrylamide <b>formation,</b> <b>tuber</b> free asparagine was not significant, potentially because it showed relatively little variation in the NFPT population.

40|$|Common scab, {{caused by}} plant {{pathogenic}} Streptomyces sp., {{is a major}} soil and tuber borne bacterial disease of potato. Whilst the disease seldom affects tuber yield, infections produce unsightly blemishes on tubers that reduce their value. It causes significant economic losses in the fresh, processing and seed market sectors of the potato industry. Despite several decades of research activity, no single measure has been developed that is able to provide effective control of this disease and comhlon scab therefore remains {{a serious threat to}} the potato production throughout the potato growing areas of the world. This project investigated links between tuber structural attributes and susceptibility to infection, an area of study under-represented in the literature and offering potential to deliver new knowledge on common scab disease that may lead to improved approaches to disease management. A series of experiments was conducted under field, glasshouse and hydroponic conditions to investigate changes in morphology and anatomy of the potato tuber. Inoculation treatments were developed to investigate relationships between structural features at the time of inoculation and the subsequent levels of infection. A novel hydroponic system was developed that allowed inoculation of individual tubers at specific times or stages of development and permitted non-destructive observation of the development of common scab symptoms. A second novel system involved the use of netting in potting bags to separate tubers from the root zone and allowed inoculation at different times during plant growth. This system facilitated study of the pathogen infection window on the tubers, and pathogen-induced structural changes in the tubers, under glasshouse conditions. Field studies were undertaken in 12 commercial crops across a range of production environments, and utilised seed from a single source to allow assessment of site effects on tuber development and disease incidence. Many tuber anatomical and morphological features (stomata and lenticel number, periderm thickness, lenticel structure, pattern of suberisation and internode expansion rate on the tubers) were found to be highly variable under different field and glasshouse conditions, and significant variability within crops/treatments was also observed. Lenticel diameter was determined by growmg environment, but other structural features varied as much between tubers within sites or treatments as between sites or treatments. Given the sporadic nature of occurrence of common scab symptoms within and between crops, the observations of variation in structural features was sufficient to indicate that anatomical features could be playing a role in susceptibility to infection. Detailed study of lenticel development on tubers revealed that two pathways of lenticel formation exist in potato <b>tubers.</b> <b>Formation</b> of lenticels from stomata, the commonly accepted pathway in the literature, occurred on all tubers, but when tubers expanded rapidly, lenticels were found to have also formed directly from peridermal rupture. In most tubers, the majority of lenticels were concluded to have formed from this second pathway. The initiation of lenticel formation in both pathways was shown to be via localised zones of increased cell division in the phellem layer, placing pressure on the outer cell layers and leading to rupture of the periderm. Continued cell division and expansion under the rupture site creates the characteristic raised lenticular shaped structure of a mature lenticel. Suberization in lenticels was observed to occur very late m Luber development in most glasshouse and hydroponically grown tubers, and lenticels with no suberisation were found in mature tubers under all growing conditions in the project. No relationship was found between tuber anatomical features at the time of exposure to the pathogen and either incidence or severity of common scab symptoms. While trends were observed within trials, when data from all experiments were examined there was no structural attribute that was consistently present or absent in treatments that induced high levels of common scab symptoms. Under field conditions, suberisation in the periderm was noted in young tubers in crops that subsequently developed high incidence of common scab, but under glasshouse conditions nonsuberized tubers at the point of inoculation were found to be highly susceptible to the disease. No evidence was found of increased suberisation in lenticels during tuber maturation being associated with reduced susceptibility to infection, with the timing of suberisation varying markedly between trials and in many conditions not recorded until very late in tuber development. The window of tuber susceptibility to common scab disease infection was shown to vary with the season or conditions under which the plants were grown. In addition, the first direct evidence that different intemodes on tubers were susceptible to infection at different times during tuber development was produced. Basal intemodes, which are the first sections of the tuber to expand, are susceptible earliest in tuber development with apical intemodes only becoming susceptible later in tuber growth by which time the basal intemodes are no longer susceptible. Basal intemodes in older tubers, which were less susceptible to common scab infection, were shown to rapidly produce additional phellem cell layers when exposed to the pathogen, whereas the same internodes in young, susceptible tubers were slower to respond. A pathogen-induced suberin deposition in phellem and filling cells was observed in less susceptible tubers in addition to the increased thickness and number of cell layers in the phellem. This result suggested that the phellem layer rather than the lenticels may be involved in common scab infection, with infection occurring directly through the periderm, as suggested by Loria et al. (2003), rather than through the lenticels as suggested by most other authors. This project has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the role and relationships between pre-existing or induced structural features of the tuber and common scab disease infection of potato. Further investigations on the role of phellem layers in disease infection and pathogen-induced phellem layer responses are recommended...|$|R

Different AM fungal inocula used produced different responses.   Some fungal inocula did not colonise potato roots at all, even in suitable growth substrates (i. e. Glomus fasiculatum).   It was observed that Glomus mosseae and Vaminoc T â formed the best associations with potato.   However, the viability of inocula {{is a major concern}} for their commercial use. Phosphate had a significant effect on the growth of potato and AM formation.   Plants grown in low phosphate were smaller in size and produced lower numbers of market sized <b>tubers.</b>   Mycorrhizal <b>formation</b> was promoted at low P soil concentrations.   Mycorrhizal plants grown at low P had increased yields of market sized tubers and tuber weights compared to the NM plants.   This was mainly due to improved P nutrition and resulted in a tuber yield comparable to that produced by plants grown in high P.   Increasing soil P concentrations decreased the level of AM formation.   If mycorrhizal plants were given high P or grown at a low light intensity then no beneficial effects of colonisation were seen.   Plants grown at low light intensities could not cope with the increased below ground demand of tubers and AM and this resulted in a decrease in the shoot C concentration.   Early tuber removal decreased C-assimilation, increased subsequent tuber number and decreased the level of AM formation.   This indicated that potato plants need to maintain a high photosynthetic rate in order to maintain an AM association.   A decrease in C-assimilation caused a decrease in AM formation. The formation of AM in different potato cultivars was investigated.   It was shown that different cultivars had varying responses to AM fungal inoculation.   Those cultivars that had low disease resistance to microbial pathogens had higher levels of AM colonisation.   Correlation analysis showed that there was an inverse relationship between disease resistance, and AM colonisation, irrespective of the growth of the potato.   This indicated that breeding for disease resistance may have bred against the formation of AM in potato.

40|$|Tubers {{of potato}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants serve as organs for {{vegetative}} propagation and stock {{of matter and}} energy for the next generation. <b>Tuber</b> <b>formation</b> is a complex process involving several successive stages: stolon formation and growth, induction of tuberization, tuber initiation and further growth. <b>Tuber</b> <b>formation</b> is affected by several external and internal factors, {{fi rst of all}} photoperiod, temperature, levels of carbohydrates and nitrogen.

40|$|The {{effects of}} plant hormones and sucrose (Suc) on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuberization were studied using in vitro cultured single-node cuttings. Tuber-inducing (high Suc) and -noninducing (low Suc or high Suc plus {{gibberellin}} [GA]) media were tested. Tuberization frequencies, tuber widths, and stolon lengths were measured during successive stages of development. Endogenous GAs and abscisic acid (ABA) {{were identified and}} quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Exogenous GA 4 / 7 promoted stolon elongation and inhibited <b>tuber</b> <b>formation,</b> whereas exogenous ABA stimulated tuberization and reduced stolon length. Indoleacetic acid-containing media severely inhibited elongation of stolons and smaller sessile tubers were formed. Exogenous cytokinins did not affect stolon elongation and <b>tuber</b> <b>formation.</b> Endogenous GA 1 level was high during stolon elongation and decreased when stolon tips started to swell under inducing conditions, whereas it remained high under noninducing conditions. GA 1 levels were negatively correlated with Suc concentration in the medium. We conclude that GA 1 {{is likely to be}} the active GA during <b>tuber</b> <b>formation.</b> Endogenous ABA levels decreased during stolon and tuber development, and ABA levels were similar under inducing and noninducing conditions. Our results indicate that GA is a dominant regulator in tuber formation: ABA stimulates tuberization by counteracting GA, and Suc regulates <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> by influencing GA levels...|$|E
40|$|Potato plants undergo several {{developmental}} stages {{during their}} life-cycle, including stolon <b>formation,</b> <b>tuber</b> initiation, tuber growth, dormancy and sprouting. Most of these stages are continuous processes, meaning that different developmental stages can occur simultaneously in one plant. Therefore, {{in order to}} study the different stages of stolon and tuber development a synchronised system was considered necessary. Using an in vitro synchronised system plant material was collected at 20 time points resulting in 22 different samples. To monitor gene expression during all these stages the cDNA-AFLP technique was used on the 22 templates, as well as fifteen different plant tissues and 10 samples where tuberisation was inhibited with gibberellins (GA 4 + 7). In total nearly 2, 000 transcript derived fragments (TDF's) were monitored, and 116 TDF's corresponding to genes differentially expressed during the potato life-cycle were isolated and sequenced. The sequence similarities between these TDF's and the sequences in the databases indicated {{that most of the}} genes are involved in defense, stress, storage and signal transduction pathways. Analysis of the tissue specificity of the 1, 926 TDF's revealed that one third were exclusively expressed in stolons and/or tubers, flowers and/or fruits, and that only 1. 5 % were common among stem (like) tissues such as stems, stolons and/or tubers. Based on the differential expression during the potato life-cycle, tissue specificity, influence of GA and homology to relevant genes, 33 TDF's were selected to proceed for promoter isolation. Two TDF's, TDFL 511 and TDF 1041, were used as probes to isolate the corresponding promoter(s), one for TDFL 511 and two for TDF 1041, by screening a potato genomic DNA library. TDFL 511 showed similarity to alcohol dehydrogenases and its corresponding protein, Stgan, is likely {{to be involved in the}} biosynthesis or breakdown of compounds affecting GA levels in the plant. The promoter region of this gene was fused to a reporter gene encoding the β-glucoronida se (GUS) protein and introduced into potato plants. Both GUS staining and in situ hybridisation experiments revealed that Stgan was exclusively expressed in the stolon cortex, in parenchyma cells. TDF 1041 is highly homologous to genes encoding non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTP), which are capable of binding lipid compounds in plant tissues. Promoter- gus gene fusions revealed that one promoter is specifically expressed in phloem cells mostly in young plants and tissues, and the other promoter showed little tissue or organ specificity. These differences in expression are likely to be due to a 331 bp insertion present in the tissue specific promoter. The representativeness in the tetraploid potato genome of the remaining 31 TDF's was determined with Southern blot analysis. Specific primers were designed for the 14 TDF's with low copy number (maximum 3 copies or alleles) and the corresponding putative promoter regions were isolated by genome walking. The putative promoter corresponding to TDFL 431, with high similarity to copper chaperones for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (CCS), was fused with the firefly luciferase gene. StCCS, the gene corresponding to TDFL 431, was found mostly in the cortex of stem (like) tissues, at a relatively high level in the stem nodes, stolons and tubers. In addition, StCCS revealed to be induced by auxin, fructose, sucrose and glucose, and inhibited by high concentrations of copper. In order to identify specific cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of the 14 (putative) potato promoters, a computer program was developed and named PRECISE (P rediction of RE gulatory CIS -acting E lements). Using this software package about 1, 400 putative cis-elements between 6 and 16 nucleotides long, common to at least 8 of the 14 promoters, were identified. Comparison of these oligomers to all the previously characterised cis-elements resulted in the identification of nine specific motifs, which are influenced by factors that play an important role during potato tuber life-cycle such as light, sugars, GA, auxin and abscisic acid. In order to test the potentialities of PRECISE to identify cis-elements, a set of 64 promoters driving 19 different genes (or gene families) involved in starch biosynthesis in Arabidopsisthaliana were analysed. To select the most relevant oligomers out of the more than 10, 000 putative motifs found with PRECISE an Arabidopsis oligomers database (AROLI) was set up and included all the oligomers between 3 and 11 nucleotides and their frequencies in Arabidopsis non-coding regions (excluding introns). Comparing the twenty most significant motifs to the ones present in PLACE database resulted in seventeen motifs, which were highly homologous to a part or the entire sequences of previously characterised cis-elements. These results proved the power of the PRECISE software package in the prediction of promoter cis-acting elements...|$|R
40|$|Tuberisation was {{obtained}} in vitro on yam (Dioscorea cayenensis-D. rotundata complex). The effect of exogenous polyamines on <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> and development (length {{and weight of}} microtubers) were investigated and discussed in relation with changes in endogenous polyamines. Application of exogenous polyamines, inhibitors of their metabolism and polyamines precursors in various concentrations positively affected microtuber formation by yam nodal cuttings and their further development. In control conditions, three weeks are needed to obtain 100 % of tuberisation. With low concentrations of putrescine (10 5 or 10 6 M), <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> occurred earlier. Polyamine endogenous level and metabolism can be significantly affected by exogenous polyamines but modifications of endogenous free polyamines could not be directly correlated to the <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> process.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and the photoperiod length {{on the growth}} and tuberization of Norland potatoes were investigated for two photoperiods, 12 -h and 24 -hr at 400 micromol/sq m per sec PPF, and at temperatures of 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 C. It was found that stem length increased with increasing temperature under both photoperiods. The highest tuber yield was obtained at 16 C under the 24 -hr photoperiod and at 20 C under the 12 -hr photoperiod (i. e., increasing the photoperiod from 12 to 24 hrs effectively decreases the optimal temperature for <b>tuber</b> <b>formation).</b> Little or no <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> occurred at 28 C under either photoperiod...|$|E
40|$|Solanum tuberosum (potato) can {{reproduce}} through tubers {{and through}} seeds. Recent developments have enabled hybrid breeding and propagation from seeds in this crop. This makes potato flowering a new focus of research interest. Tuberization and presumably flowering, followed by seed set, are strongly regulated by environmental cues. A well-studied environmental regulator of <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> is day length. Photoreceptors {{are involved in}} this photoperiodic control of tuberization, suggesting light spectrum may be an important factor for tuberization. However, it is not known how photoreceptors control potato flowering. Here, we aim to elucidate the influence of light spectrum and photoperiod on tuber and flower formation, by growing three potato genotypes in climate chambers with light-emitting diode (LED) lighting and additional far-red and blue LEDs under long and short days. Far-red light accelerated <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> up to eleven days and blue light slightly delayed it up to four days. An effect of light spectrum on flowering was not found. Long photoperiods delayed <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> compared to short-day conditions in two of the three tested genotypes. Aside from one genotype which only flowered in long-days, no effect of photoperiod on flowering was found...|$|E
40|$|BEL 1 -like {{transcription}} factors {{interact with}} Knotted 1 types to regulate numerous developmental processes. In potato (Solanum tuberosum), the BEL 1 transcription factor St BEL 5 and its protein partner POTH 1 regulate <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> by mediating hormone {{levels in the}} stolon tip. The accumulation of St BEL 5 RNA increases in response to short-day photoperiods, inductive for <b>tuber</b> <b>formation.</b> RNA detection methods and heterografting experiments demonstrate that BEL 5 transcripts are present in phloem cells and move across a graft union to localize in stolon tips, the site of tuber induction. This movement of RNA to stolon tips is correlated with enhanced tuber production. Overexpression of BEL 5 transcripts that include the untranslated sequences of the BEL 5 transcript endows transgenic lines with the capacity to overcome the inhibitory effects of long days on <b>tuber</b> <b>formation.</b> Addition of the untranslated regions leads to preferential accumulation of the BEL 5 RNA in stolon tips under short-day conditions. Using a leaf-specific promoter, the movement of BEL 5 RNA to stolon tips was facilitated by a short-day photoperiod, and this movement was correlated with enhanced tuber production. These results implicate the transcripts of St BEL 5 in a long-distance signaling pathway that are delivered to the target organ via the phloem stream...|$|E

40|$|Tubers can be {{initiated}} and developed in vitro from nodal cuttings of yam (Dioscorea cayenensis - D. rotundata complex). The effect of exogenous jasmonic acid, {{alone or in}} combination with putrescine, on these processes was investigated in relationship to endogenous jasmonic acid and polyamine levels. Application of exogenous jasmonic acid at various concentrations positively affected microtuber formation and growth from yam nodal cuttings. In control conditions, three weeks were needed to obtain 100 % of tuberisation. Jasmonic acid at low level (0. 1 µM) accelerated <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> (46 % after one week) as did putrescine (10 µM). But endogenous levels of jasmonic acid were not significantly affected by its exogenous presence in the medium. Jasmonic acid also interacted with other growth regulators as polyamines, but the decrease in time necessary to observe <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> could not be correlated with endogenous modifications of PUT content. The presence of jasmonic acid (0. 1 to 1 µM) as PUT (1 µM) induced also an increase of tuber length and weight. The combination of jasmonic acid (0. 1 µM) and putrescine (1 µM) had no positive effect on <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> (precocity) but had an additive effect on further growth (length and weight).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{reducing}} sucrose level on <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> (% of cultures with microtubers), development (length and fresh weight of microtubers) and sprouting in yam Dioscorea cayenensis-D. rotundata complex in vitro were investigated. Only 29 % of the explants showed <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> after 3 {{weeks in the}} presence of 1 % sucrose in contrast to 100 % with 3 %. After 120 days of culture, the length and the weight of the tubers obtained {{in the presence of}} 1 % sucrose were less than with 3 % sucrose. Addition of sorbitol to keep osmolarity at the same level did not restore normal rate of <b>tuber</b> <b>formation.</b> Similar results were obtained with the use of reduced fructose or glucose level. Microtuber sprouting was also affected by sucrose level incorporated into the tuberisation medium. Tubers obtained on reduced sucrose level sprouted later and the increase of osmolarity with sorbitol did not restore normal sprouting. The bigger tubers obtained on high sucrose media could contain more carbohydrate reserves that could partially explain a higher sprouting rate. These results can be used for optimising in vitro conditions for mass production of microtubers in yam and especially in Dioscorea cayenensis-D. rotundata complex, a very important species in West Africa. They specially showed the importance of tuberisation conditions on precocity of tuberisation, on tuber length and weight and on their further sprouting. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Premature {{formation}} of tubers ('submarines') is a disturbance in the normal growth of a planted seed potato, resulting in the {{formation of}} some small daughter tubers without any aerial growth. In certain years losses may be heavy. The main cause is the formation of sprouts during storage which have to be removed. All factors preventing or reducing such sprout formation favour normal development: especially low temperature (above freezing-point) and light during storage, also late lifting of the seed tubers, large tubers, planting at higher temperature and in moist soil. The underlying process of premature <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> was assumed to be loss of water by removal of sprouts during storage, resulting in an increase in the concentration of solutes.
