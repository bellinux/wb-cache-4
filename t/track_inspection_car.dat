50|$|The initial JNR {{investigation}} {{found that the}} speed of the freight train (60 km/h) was not excessive, nor were any problems found with the line or rolling stock. For five years from 1967 until 1972, the RTRI carried out tests on a test track located at Karikachi Pass in Hokkaido on an abandoned section of the Nemuro Main Line (Shintoku - Niinai) using the same rails and rolling stock and found that the combination of wheelset design, rail cross section and wear, and track geometry all had a role in the derailment. As a result of the investigation, the old method of static <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> was replaced with new <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> employing dynamic <b>inspection</b> methods and data collection.|$|R

40|$|Track that {{supports}} railway cars {{is exposed to}} repeated train running load, advancing deterioration of tracks. Thus, {{it is important to}} correctly identify the status of deterioration by inspections and to carry out repairs at an appropriate timing. At JR East, we measure dynamic displacement (track irregularity when train load applied) by electric and <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> (East-i) every three months. Material deterioration is periodically inspected by track patrolling on foot and mechanically by <b>inspection</b> devices. With <b>track</b> irregularity for example, when track irregularity exceeds the specified threshold (standard for repair), we estimate the timing for repair based on past experience and <b>car</b> body vibration <b>inspection</b> data to conduct systematic repair. But, even at locations where measurement results have not reached such a threshold, track irregularity may rapidly progress due to factors such as condition of the ballas...|$|R
5000|$|The {{techniques}} {{mentioned above}} are utilized {{in a handful}} of different ways. The probes and transducers can be utilized on a [...] "walking stick", on a hand pushed trolley, or in a hand held setup. These devices are used when small sections of track are to be inspected or when a precise location is desired. Many times these detail oriented inspection devices follow up on indications made by a rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> or HiRail trucks. Handheld inspection devices are very useful for this when the track is used heavily, because they can be removed relatively easy. However, they are considered very slow and tedious, when there are thousands of miles of <b>track</b> that need <b>inspection.</b> [...] Rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> and HiRail trucks are the answer to today’s high mileage inspection needs. The first rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> were created by Dr. Sperry. Since then, many new models have rolled out. These rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> are basically their own train with inspection equipment on board. The probes and transducers are mounted on carriages located underneath the <b>inspection</b> <b>car.</b> Modern day <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> now use multiple NDT methods. Induction and ultrasound methods can be used in rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> and operate at testing speeds of more than 30 mph. The next generation will go even faster.|$|R

40|$|Relationship between track {{alignment}} irregularity and car body horizontal vibration acceleration is analyzed by using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Actual measured alignment irregularity and car body horizontal vibration acceleration are decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain intrinsic mode function (IMF). By comparing IMF waveform and energy {{spectrum of the}} irregularity and vibration acceleration, there is the definitive correspondence of IMFs, and the adverse section of irregularity can be identified from car body horizontal vibration acceleration. Finally, regression analysis is taken for measured sample of <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>car</b> on Beijing-Guangzhou line; the quantitative relationship between {{track alignment}} irregularity and car body horizontal vibration acceleration is established with a wavelength between 1. 5 m and 50 m...|$|E
30|$|However, due to {{different}} equipments and operation modes, {{the research and}} analysis in the National Railway are not suitable for subway. At the same time, the research about the analysis of subway is less so this paper takes the irregularity data from Beijing Subway <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>car</b> as sample; researching the irregularity PSD of Beijing Subway, the data in the research are from a project which is under way. Meanwhile, it makes the fitting spectrum of the track spectrum density on Beijing Subway and then gets the corresponding characteristic parameters. Thus, we can obtain a scientific evaluation and give a suitable management for railway track irregularity. In addition, we could also put forward reasonable repair advice for Beijing Subway, and provide technical support {{for the quality of}} lines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 3 D FEM {{models of}} ladder track and rail-bearing {{platform}} track on metro viaduct were established {{to analyze the}} vibration reduction characteristics of ladder track structure. Based on track irregularities measured by <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>car,</b> time-history vertical accelerations of rail, sleeper, flange and beam bottom were solved to contrast the dynamic characteristics of the two track structure. Results show that the vibration level of rail and sleeper are higher on ladder track than on rail-bearing platform track, and the vibration reducing effect of ladder track for flange and beam bottom mainly embodies in frequency range of 1 ~ 40 Hz in which average vibration reduction values on flange and beam bottom are 28 dB and 22 dB, with maximum values 40 dB and 33 dB. The results can provide reference for design of ladder track {{as well as its}} application in metro line...|$|E

40|$|The {{track is}} {{constantly}} exposed to vertical and lateral deformation under repeated loading by trains. Periodic {{measurement of the}} resulting track displacement (track irregularity) and adequate repair are vital to ensure riding comfort and running safety.

40|$|Subsidence and {{geometry}} deformation monitoring {{are essential}} for safe transportation on a high-speed railway. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is able to collect dense three-dimensional point data from the survey scene and achieve highly accurate measurements; therefore, it {{is considered to be}} one of the most promising surveying techniques for railway track geometry deformation monitoring. This paper proposes a new approach that uses TLS to detect subsidence and irregularities in a track by fitting boundaries of the cross section of the track. In addition, for a section of local railway, an outdoor experiment was performed to ascertain the feasibility and accuracy of this method. The deformations detected with TLS were compared with the field measurements gathered with other methods such as those from a <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>car.</b> The results indicate that the subsidence difference between TLS and precise leveling is 2 – 3 mm, and the difference in the geometric parameters of the tracks is 1 – 2 mm. Finally, the possible causes of error involved with TLS are discussed...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} rail surface {{real-time}} visual detection method, {{focusing on the}} target location and rail surface defects contour extraction, to achieve the detection requirements {{through the use of}} the structural characteristics of the existing target to simplify the calculation. LabVIEW was used to write the algorithm program to achieve a portable track defect visual inspection system, based on the machine vision of the portable <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>car</b> to carry out the field experiment. Through the test of the target area location under the different sub-value, the best value of the target area location algorithm is determined. Using the image acquisition site and part of the manual synthesis, defect images verify the effectiveness of rail surface defects detection and detection time meets the requirements of real-time detection, can be in a certain extent instead of manual inspection. Due to the limited time, the portable track defect visual inspection system is only a preliminary realization of the track defect detection automation. Further research is needed: measures for preventing the influence of the uneven light on the rail surface on the defects of the rail and the station’s throat area and rapid discrimination of the occlusion; measures to complete the whole line real-time detection and other issues under the existing train speed; and measures to better facilitate the application of real-time detection of existing lines.|$|E

40|$|A <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>car,</b> which {{measures}} {{the shape of}} railway tracks (hereafter, rail geometry) while it is running on rails, discretizes the measurement results at nearly fixed spatial intervals. However, {{the distance between the}} discret-ized locations (spatial sampling intervals) may shorten or lengthen locally due to slipping or sliding of the car wheel, and this prevents the sampling locations from aligning with those of a dataset obtained with another measuring run. The authors developed an algorithm for approximately aligning the sampling locations of the measurement datasets ob-tained with different runs. First, they considered this prob-lem as the selection of the series of data corresponding to each supervised data from a training dataset, which was constructed by interpolation in order to minimize the evalu-ation function of a number sequence representing data points. Next, they used the maximum likelihood method to identify the unknown parameters contained in the evalu-ation function. This problem uses two features of the evalu-ation function. The first is that the evaluation function is minimized by dynamic programming, and the obtained optimum sequence is equivalent to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate in the Bayesian framework. The second is that by converting the evaluation function to a general state space representation, the log likelihood of the model that includes the parameters is obtained by a nonlinear filtering method. Also, to simplify the search for the identification, they devised a parameter search procedure for the parame-ters in the autoregressive (AR) model. © 2005 Wiley Peri...|$|E
