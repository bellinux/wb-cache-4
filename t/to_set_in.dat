5|$|Corrector totius orientis (governor of {{the entire}} East): it is {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars that he bore this title. The corrector had an overall command of the Roman armies and authority over the Roman provincial governors in the designated region. There are no known attestations of the title during Odaenathus' lifetime. Evidences for the king bearing the title are two inscriptions in Palmyrene dialect; one posthumous dedication describing him as MTQNNʿ of the East (derived from the Aramaic root TQN, meaning <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> order), and the other describing his heir Vaballathus with the same title albeit using the word PNRTTʿ instead of MTQNNʿ.|$|E
5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to watch him perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> motion her plot.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} text-based {{graphics}} and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> motion {{a process which}} generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth {{and taking care of}} the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventure mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed.|$|E

5|$|When the Corregidor {{entered the}} minefield, {{there was a}} large {{explosion}} on the starboard side of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that {{there was no time for}} large-scale panic <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in.</b> Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in.</b> They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E

25|$|In the Peterborough area, Highway7 was rerouted from {{travelling}} {{through the}} city to bypassing it along Highway115. This situation took over six years <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> place. On April1, 1997, the sections of Highway 7 entering {{the western edge of}} Peterborough along North Monaghan Parkway and Sir Sanford Fleming Drive were transferred to the county and city, creating a gap between Springville and the Peterborough Bypass. This situation was rectified on May1, 2003, when the section of Highway7A that until then was a continuation of the road south from Springville to Highway115 was renumbered as Highway7. The concurrency with Highway115 was extended southwest to remove the discontinuity entirely.|$|E
25|$|Impacts {{at these}} high speeds produce shock waves in solid materials, and both {{impactor}} {{and the material}} impacted are rapidly compressed to high density. Following initial compression, the high-density, over-compressed region rapidly depressurizes, exploding violently, <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> train {{the sequence of events}} that produces the impact crater. Impact-crater formation is therefore more closely analogous to cratering by high explosives than by mechanical displacement. Indeed, the energy density of some material involved in the formation of impact craters is many times higher than that generated by high explosives. Since craters are caused by explosions, they are nearly always circular – only very low-angle impacts cause significantly elliptical craters.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (GDV), {{also known}} as bloat, is the greatest killer of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. GDV occurs in deep-chested breeds and requires immediate veterinary care. It {{can be caused by}} wolfing down too much water, too much food too fast, exercise after eating, stress or unknown conditions. Symptoms are distended abdomen, excessive salivating, depression and lethargy. When GDV occurs it cuts off the esophagus, and blood supply to the heart is lessened causing low blood pressure as well as other cardiac problems; the dog can go into shock. Organ damage can occur as well and the stomach may rupture causing peritonitis <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in.</b> If not treated, the dog may die.|$|E

25|$|Bosaso has a hot {{desert climate}} (Köppen climate {{classification}} BWh). It has a mean annual relative humidity of around 60%. The average daily mean temperature year-round is 30°C, {{with an average}} annual high of 35°C and an average annual low of 25°C. Average low temperatures are coolest {{during the winter months}} of December to February, when thermometer readings typically level out at 20°C. The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average high temperatures later peak during the summer months of June to August, when they consistently exceed 40°C (104°F). Come September, cooler weather starts <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> again. Rainfall reaches a high over this period, with an average precipitation of 7mm (0.28 inches) in November.

25|$|Bitumen was the nemesis of {{many artists}} during the 19th century. Although widely {{used for a}} time, it {{ultimately}} proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.|$|E
25|$|With some hesitance, Gherman Pântea {{endorsed}} the Republic's union with Romania, affiliating {{with the local}} Bessarabian Peasants' Party, then with Romania's National Liberals. Having parallel careers as teacher, lawyer and journalist, Pântea remained a presence in Romanian political life, as member of Parliament, negotiator of détente with the Soviet Union, and three times Mayor of Chișinău. He was however mistrusted for his defense of arrested Bolsheviks, his critique of centralized government, and his alleged corruption. During World War II, Pântea was Mayor of Odessa under a Romanian occupation. He intervened to save Jews from the 1941 Odessa massacre and the subsequent deportations to camps in Transnistria. He had a tumultuous relationship with Ion Antonescu, the Romanian dictator, and was kept in check by the occupation authority. His administration managed <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> motion a plan for Odessa, and helped the city overcome devastation through the adoption of free trade, but also created various controversies.|$|E
