Here we thoroughly investigated the bacterial genes derived from a Wolbachia endosymbiont on the nuclear genome of the beetle Callosobruchus chinensis. Exhaustive PCR detection and Southern blot analysis suggested that ∼ 30 % of Wolbachia genes, {{in terms of the}} gene repertoire of wMel, are present on the insect nuclear genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization located the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> on the proximal region of the basal short arm of the X chromosome. Molecular evolutionary and other lines of evidence indicated that the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> are probably derived from a single lateral transfer event. The <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> were, for the length examined, structurally disrupted, freed from functional constraints, and transcriptionally inactive. Hence, most, if not all, of the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> have been pseudogenized. Notwithstanding this, the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> were ubiquitously detected from Japanese and Taiwanese populations of C. chinensis, while the number of the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> detected differed between the populations.

Although acquisition of genes from other species, horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer,</b> {{is considered to}} occur, definitive concrete cases have been unavailable. It is desirable to select horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> reliably and examine their relationship to operons. We here developed a method to identify candidates of horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> based on minimization of gene cluster insertions/deletions. To select a benchmark set of positively horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> against which the candidate set can be appraised, we devised another procedure using intergenetic alignments. Comparison with the benchmark set of horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> demonstrated {{the absence of a}} significant number of false positives in the candidates, showing that the method identifies horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> {{with a high degree of}} confidence. Horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> constitute at least 5. 5 % of the genes in Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella and ~ 46 % of which originate from other gamma-proteobacteria. Not only informational genes, but also operational genes (those involved in housekeeping) are horizontally transferred less frequently than expected. A gene-cluster analysis of Escherichia coli K- 12 operons revealed that horizontal transfer produced four entire operons and expanded two operons, but deletion of intervening genes accounts for the formation of no operons. We propose that operons generally form by horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer.</b> We further suggest that genes with related essential functions tend to reside in conserved operons, while genes in nonconserved operons generally confer slight advantage to the organisms and frequently undergo horizontal transfer and decay.

However, among methicillin-resistant S. aureus 52 % (45 of 89) were probe positive while only 2 % (2 of 86) of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were probe positive.

To accurately determine the frequency of phage-mediated gene transfer, we employed cycling primed in situ amplification-fluorescent in situ hybridization (CPRINS-FISH) and investigated the movement of the ampicillin resistance gene among Escherichia coli cells mediated by phage at the single-cell level. Phages P 1 and T 4 and the newly isolated E. coli phage EC 10 were used as vectors. The transduction frequencies determined by conventional plating were 3 × 10 − 8 to 2 × 10 − 6, 1 × 10 − 8 to 4 × 10 − 8, and < 4 × 10 − 9 to 4 × 10 − 8 per PFU for phages P 1, T 4, and EC 10, respectively. The frequencies of DNA transfer determined by CPRINS-FISH were 7 × 10 − 4 to 1 × 10 − 3, 9 × 10 − 4 to 3 × 10 − 3, and 5 × 10 − 4 to 4 × 10 − 3 for phages P 1, T 4, and EC 10, respectively. Direct viable counting combined with CPRINS-FISH revealed that more than 20 % of the cells carrying the <b>transferred</b> <b>gene</b> retained their viabilities.

40|$|Lateral gene {{transfer}} {{has played a}} key role in the evolution of living beings. This process was first acknowledged in (1978) by Schwartz and Dayhoff but considered a relatively infrequent eccentricity and ignored.

40|$|Background Horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>{{transfer}},</b> {{the transfer}} and incorporation of genetic material between {{different species of}} organisms, has an important but poorly quantified role in the adaptation of microbes to their environment. Previous work has shown that genome size {{and the number of}} horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> are strongly correlated. Here we consider how genome size confuses the quantification of horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> because the number of genes an organism accumulates over time depends on its evolutionary history and ecological context (e. g., the nutrient regime for which it is adapted). Results We investigated horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> between archaea and bacteria by first counting reciprocal BLAST hits among 448 bacterial and 57 archaeal genomes to find shared genes. Then we used the DarkHorse algorithm, a probability-based, lineage-weighted method (Podell & Gaasterland, 2007), to identify potential horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> among these shared genes. By removing the effect of genome size in the bacteria, we have identified bacteria with unusually large numbers of shared genes with archaea for their genome size. Interestingly, archaea and bacteria that live in anaerobic and/or high temperature conditions are more likely to share unusually large numbers of genes. However, high salt was not found to significantly affect the numbers of shared genes. Numbers of shared (genome size-corrected, reciprocal BLAST hits) and <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> (identified by DarkHorse) were strongly correlated. Thus archaea and bacteria that live in anaerobic and/or high temperature conditions are more likely to share horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes.</b> These horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> are over-represented by genes involved in energy conversion as well as the transport and metabolism of inorganic ions and amino acids. Conclusions Anaerobic and thermophilic bacteria share unusually large numbers of genes with archaea. This is mainly due to horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> of <b>genes</b> from the archaea to the bacteria. In general, these transfers are from archaea that live in similar oxygen and temperature conditions as the bacteria that receive the genes. Potential hotspots of horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> between archaea and bacteria include hot springs, marine sediments, and oil wells. Cold spots for horizontal transfer included dilute, aerobic, mesophilic environments such as marine and freshwater surface waters...|$|R

However, detection methods depend greatly {{on the quality of the}} underlying genomic data, which are typically complex for eukaryotes. Furthermore, given the automated nature of genomic data collection, it is typically impractical to manually verify all protein or gene models, orthology predictions, and multiple sequence alignments, requiring researchers to accept a substantial margin of error in their datasets. Using a test case comprising plant-associated genomes across the fungal kingdom, this study reveals that composition- and phylogeny-based methods have little statistical power to detect laterally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes.</b> In particular, phylogenetic methods reveal extreme levels of topological variation in fungal gene trees, the vast majority of which show departures from the canonical species tree. Therefore, it is inherently challenging to detect LGT events in typical eukaryotic genomes. This finding is in striking contrast to the large number of claims for laterally <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> in eukaryotic species that routinely appear in the literature, and questions how many of these proposed examples are statistically well supported...|$|R
