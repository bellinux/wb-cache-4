One hypothesis for their rarity is that evolutionary constraints limit N-fixing tree diversity, preventing N-fixing species from filling available niches in higher-latitude forests. Here, we test this hypothesis {{using data from the}} USA and Mexico. N-fixing trees comprise only a slightly smaller fraction of taxa at higher vs. lower latitudes (8 % vs. 11 % of genera), despite 11 -fold lower abundance (1. 2 % vs. 12. 7 % of basal area). Furthermore, N-fixing trees are abundant but belong <b>to</b> <b>few</b> <b>species</b> on tropical islands, suggesting that low absolute diversity does not limit their abundance. Rhizobial taxa dominate N-fixing tree richness at lower latitudes, whereas actinorhizal species do at higher latitudes.

40|$|Most {{animals do}} not feed {{on all the}} {{resources}} available to them, but the mechanisms behind the evolution of dietary specialization are still debated. A central but unanswered question is whether specialists generally gain fitness advantages on their resource compared to generalists, experiencing a trade-off between {{the ability to use}} a broad range of resources and the fitness reached on each single one. Empirical tests so far suffered from difficulties in measuring fitness; they were restricted <b>to</b> <b>few</b> <b>species,</b> and results were equivocal. This lack of support for the importance of trade-offs gave rise to theories explaining the evolution of specialization without such trade-offs. Using a large dataset of intentional biological control introductions of 254 species of parasitoids from 15 families to locations outside their native range, we show that establishment success, a measure of total fitness, is higher in specialized species. This result holds when controlling for possible confounding factors such as the number of introduced individuals (propagule pressure). The outcome of this study provides robust evidence that dietary specialization implies fitness advantages in an entire species-rich taxon, indicating that trade-offs might be widely involved in the evolution of specialization...|$|E

This process is occurring to the same extent as it was during the geological extinctions, but now it has a much faster rate (Standovár and Primack 2001). Today, the extension of human-transformed areas (settlements, roads, agricultural areas etc.) is so large that all of the remaining natural or semi-natural areas must be protected in order to increase the chance of survival of the remaining species.

We assess relationships between longevity, reproductive onset, reproductive rate and age for 834 longitudinally monitored wild female African elephants in Amboseli, Kenya. The mean known age at first reproduction was 13. 8 years; only 5 % commenced reproduction by 10 years. Early reproducers (< 12. 5 years) had higher age-specific fertility rates than did females who commenced reproduction late (15 + years) with no differences in survival between these groups. Age-specific reproductive rates of females dying before 40 years were reduced by comparison to same-aged survivors, illustrating a mortality filter and reproductive advantages of a long life. Overall, 95 % of fertility was completed before 50, and 95 % of mortality experienced by age 65, with a mean life expectancy of 41 years for females who survived to the minimum age at first birth (9 years). Elephant females have a relatively long period (c. 16 years) of viability after 95 % completed fertility, although reproduction does not entirely cease until they are over 65.

In this paper we describe {{a condition in which}} the bloom  is of multi-year duration consisting of different morphologies of a single cyanobacteria species. Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, México maintained a year-round massive (10 8 trichomes L - 1) population of potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria, Cylindrospermopsis spp. The trichomes are present as straight and coiled morphotypes.   The relative trichome morphology abundance varied with rainy (June – October) and dry seasons (November – May), but total trichome abundance did not vary.  Coiled trichomes and heterocytes (occurring only on coiled trichomes) were significantly more abundant, both absolutely and relatively, during the dry season. Both coiled trichome and heterocyte mean volumes were significantly smaller during the rainy season than during the dry season.   Biovolumes were largest in January when water temperature was 5 º C cooler suggesting buoyancy as a morphology-determining factor. However, with a more than three-fold lower TIN concentration during the dry season, we hypothesized that the coiled morphotype became abundant primarily because it formed heterocytes, which the straight morphotype did not. Spatial trichome and heterocyte abundance differences were small among the 15 lake sites (average CV for all dates = 20 %). However, there was a pattern of increased heterocyte and coiled trichome abundance from lake inflow, as a nitrogen source, to outflow during the rainy season. The total volume of heterocytes per litre of lake water increased progressively four-fold from a minimum early in the rainy season to a maximum {{at the end of the}} dry season.

The increase in digestibility was not caused by mastication or by the freezing of extrusa samples during storage but by the action of saliva. Comparable increases in IVDML were achieved merely by mixing bovine saliva with ground forage samples. Differences were greater than could be explained by increases due to completely digestible salivary DM. There {{was no significant difference between}} animals in relation to the saliva effect on IVDML and, except for some minor differences, similar saliva effects on IVDML were measured using either the pepsin-cellulase or rumen fluid-pepsin in vitro techniques. For both C- 4 and C- 3 grasses the magnitude of the differences were inversely related to IVDML of the feed and there was little or no difference between extrusa and feed at high digestibilities (> 70 %) whereas differences of more than 10 percentage units were measured on low quality grass forages.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between tree age and various parameters of tree size in order to develop models to predict the growth of the most important species of an urban forest in northeastern Italy. The logarithmic regression model, proposed by Peper et al. (2001 a,b) and applied by Stoffberg et al. (2008, 2009), and other equations were tested in order to obtain the best fit for each species and parameter. All the models provided a better fit for the larger species (Tilia x vulgaris Hayne, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl., Acer platanoides L.) than for the smaller ones (Prunus cerasifera “pissardi” (Carriere) L. H. Bailey and Lagerstroemia indica L.). The equations for predicting tree sizes and leaf area are presented and applied to compare size and growth 15 and 25 years after planting. According to the models A. platanoides attained the largest average annual DBH growth with values ranging from an average of 1. 25 cm years− 1 between 0 and 15 years after planting and 1. 52 cm years− 1 between 15 and 25 years after planting. L. indica showed the smaller DBH growth, ranging from 0. 34 cm years− 1 in the first period to 0. 48 cm years− 1 in the second period. 25 years after planting. A. platanoides L. is the tallest species and reaches the largest crown diameter, whith the largest average annual growth, followed by F. angustifolia and Tilia x vulgaris that show similar growth patterns.

40|$|Aggression between ants from {{different}} colonies or species is ubiquitous. Exceptions {{to this rule}} exist {{in the form of}} supercolonies (within a species) and interspecific associations (between species). Probably the most intimate interspecific association is the parabiosis, where two ant species live together in a common nest. They keep their brood separate but jointly use trails and often share food resources. Parabioses are restricted <b>to</b> <b>few</b> <b>species</b> pairings and occur in South American and Southeast Asian rainforests. While the South American parabioses have been studied, albeit poorly, almost nothing is known about their Southeast Asian counterparts. My PhD project focuses on Southeast Asian parabioses between the myrmicine Crematogaster modiglianii Emery 1900 and the considerably larger formicine Camponotus rufifemur Emery 1900. The two species frequently nest together in hollow trees in the tropical lowland rainforest of Borneo. The basic question of my PhD project is why these two species live together. I investigated both proximate and ultimate aspects of this question. For comparative purposes, I included studies on a trail-sharing association in the same habitat. On the proximate level, I investigated which mechanisms facilitate tolerance towards hetero-spe¬ci¬fic nestmates. Ants generally discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates via cuticular hydro¬carbons that function as colony recognition cues. I studied the specificity of nestmate recognition within and between the two parabiotic species. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), I analyzed the cuticular substances in both ant species to find potential differences to non-parabiotic species, and to estimate the substance overlap among the two species. A high substance overlap would e. g. suggest that interspecific tolerance is caused by chemical mimicry. Finally, bioassays were conducted to evaluate the function of different cuticular compounds. Interspecific tolerance in the two parabiotic species was species-specific but not colony-specific. Ca. rufifemur tolerated all Cr. modiglianii individuals, even those from foreign colonies, but strongly attacked workers of other Crematogaster species. Cr. modiglianii, in turn, tolerated Ca. rufifemur workers of certain foreign colonies but attacked those of others. Chemical analyses revealed two sympatric, chemically distinct Ca. rufifemur varieties (‘red’ and ‘black’) with almost no hydrocarbon overlap. Cr. modiglianii only tolerated foreign Ca. rufifemur workers if they belonged to the same chemical variety as their own Ca. rufifemur partner. It also attacked other, non-parabiotic Camponotus species. Thus, reciprocal interspecific tolerance was restricted to the species Cr. modiglianii and Ca. rufifemur. Ca. rufifemur frequently tolerated conspecific non-nestmates of the same chemical variety. Minor workers were more often tolerated than majors, possibly because they possess two to three times lower hydrocarbon quantities per body surface than majors. In contrast, Cr. modiglianii nearly always attacked conspecific non-nestmates. Both species possessed hydrocarbons with considerably higher chain lengths than congeneric, non-parabiotic ant species. Long-chain hydrocarbons are less volatile than shorter ones and thus harder to perceive. They may thus considerably facilitate interspecific tolerance. Moreover, up to 98 % of the cuticular hydrocarbons in Ca. rufifemur were methylbranched alkenes, which are highly unusual among insect cuticular hydrocarbons. Cr. modiglianii and Ca. rufifemur had almost no hydrocarbons in common, refuting chemical mimicry as a possible cause of interspecific tolerance. The only hydrocarbons common to both species were two methylbranched alkenes, which constituted 89 % of the ‘red’ Ca. rufifemur hydrocarbon profile and also occurred in those Cr. modiglianii colonies that lived together with this Ca. rufifemur variety. Cr. modiglianii presumably acquired these two compounds from its red Ca. rufifemur partner. Cr. modiglianii was significantly less aggressive towards foreign Cr. modiglianii workers that were associated with the same Ca. rufifemur variety than to those associated with the respective other one. Hence, this species seemed to use recognition cues acquired from its parabiotic partner. Apart from hydrocarbons, both species possessed a set of hitherto unknown substances on their cuticle. The quantitative composition of the unknown compounds varied between parabiotic nests but was similar among the two species of a nest. They are probably produced in the Dufour glanf of Cr. modiglianii and transferred to their Ca. rufifemur partner. Possible transfer mechanisms include interspecific trophallaxis and ‘mounting behaviour’, where Cr. modiglianii climbed onto Ca. rufifemur workers without being displaced. Although the composition of the unknown compounds greatly varied between nests, they did not function as nestmate recognition cues since both species used hydrocarbons for nestmate recognition. However, the unknown compounds significantly reduced aggression in Ca. rufifemur. The ultimate, i. e. ecological and evolutionary aspects of my PhD research deal with potential costs and benefits that Cr. modiglianii and Ca. rufifemur may derive from the parabiotic association, their interactions with other species, and population genetic analyses. Additional studies on a trail-sharing association between three other ant species deal with two possible mechanisms that may cause or facilitate trail-sharing. Whether parabioses are parasitic, commensalistic, or mutualistic, is largely unknown and depends on the costs and benefits each party derives from the association. I therefore investigated food competition (as one of the most probable costs), differentiation of foraging niches (which can reduce competition), and several potential benefits of the parabiotic way of life. Besides, I studied interactions between the ant species and the hemiepiphyte Poikilospermum cordifolium. The foraging niches of the two species differed regarding foraging range, daily activity pattern, and food preferences. None of the two species aggressively displaced its partner species from baits. Thus, interference competition for food seemed to be low or absent. For both ant species, a number of benefits from the parabiotic lifestyle seem possible. They include interspecific trail-following, joint nest defence, provision of nest space by the partner species, food exchange via trophallaxis, and mutual brood care. If an ant species follows another species’ pheromone trails, it can reach food resources found by the other species. As shown by artificial extract trails, Ca. rufifemur workers indeed followed trails of Cr. modiglianii but not vice versa. Thus, Ca. rufifemur benefited from Cr. modiglianii’s knowledge on food sources (informational parasitism). In turn, Cr. modiglianii seemed to profit from nest defence by Ca. rufifemur. Ca. rufifemur majors are substantially larger than Cr. modiglianii workers. Although Cr. modiglianii often effectively defended the nest as well, it seemed likely that this species derived a benefit from its partner’s defensive abilities. In neotropical parabioses (ant-gardens), mutualistic epiphytes {{play an important role in}} providing nest space. The neotropical Camponotus benefits its Crematogaster partner by planting epiphyte seeds, for which Crematogaster is too small. Similarly, the Bornean parabioses often were inhabited by the hemiepiphyte Poikilospermum cordifolium (Barg. -Petr.) Merr (Cecropiaceae). P. cordifolium seedlings, saplings and sometimes larger indivi¬duals abundantly grew at the entrances of parabiotic nests. However, P. cordifolium provides no additional nest space and, apart from nutritive elaiosomes, perianths, and extrafloral nectar probably plays a less important role for the ants than the neotropical epiphytes. In conclusion, the parabiosis is probably beneficial to both species. The main benefits seem to be nest defence (for Cr. modiglianii) and interspecific trail-following (for Ca. rufifemur). However, Ca. rufifemur seems to be more dependent on its partner than vice versa. For both parabiotic species, I analyzed mitochondrial DNA of ants {{from different}} regions in Borneo. My data suggest that there are four genetically and chemically distinct, but closely related varieties of Camponotus rufifemur. In contrast, Crematogaster modiglianii showed high genetic differentiation between distant populations but was not differentiated into genetic or chemical varieties. This argues against variety-specific cocladogenesis between Cr. modiglianii and Ca. rufifemur, although a less specific coevolution of the two species is highly likely. In Bornean rainforests, trail-sharing associations of Polyrhachis (Polyrhachis) ypsilon Emery 1887 and Camponotus (Colobopsis) saundersi Emery 1889 are common and often include further species such as Dolichoderus cuspidatus Smith 1857. I investigated a trail-sharing association between these three species and studied two mechanisms that may cause or facilitate these associations: interspecific trail-following, i. e. workers following another species’ pheromone trail, and differential inter¬specific aggression. In trail-following assays, D. cuspidatus regularly followed extract trails of the other two species, thus probably parasitizing on their information on food sources. In contrast, only few P. ypsilon and Ca. saundersi workers followed hetero¬speci¬fic extract trails. Hence, the association between P. ypsilon and Ca. saundersi cannot be ex¬plained by foragers following heterospecific trails. In this case, trail-sharing may originate from few scout ants that do follow heterospecific pheromone trails and then lay their own trails. Interspecific aggression among P. ypsilon, Ca. saundersi and D. cuspidatus was strongly asymmetric, Ca. saundersi being submissive to the other two species. All three species discriminated between heterospecific workers from the same and a distant trail-sharing site. Thus, it seems likely that the species of a given trail-sharing site habituate to one another. Differential tolerance by dominant ant species may be mediated by selective habituation towards submissive species, and thereby influence the assembly of trail-sharing associations. Aggression zwischen Ameisen verschiedener Kolonien oder Arten ist allgegenwärtig. Ausnahmen von dieser Regel bilden Superkolonien (innerhalb einer Art) sowie inter-spezifische Assoziationen (zwischen Arten). Wohl die engste dieser Assoziationen ist die Parabiose, bei der zwei Ameisenarten in einem gemeinsamen Nest leben. Sie halten ihre Brut getrennt, nutzen jedoch gemeinsam Pfade und oftmals auch Nahrungsressourcen. Parabiosen sind auf Assoziationen einiger weniger Artkombinationen beschränkt und kommen nur in südamerikanischen und südostasiatischen Regenwäldern vor. Während jedoch die südamerikanischen Parabiosen bereits untersucht wurden – wenn auch spärlich –, ist fast nichts über ihre südostasiatischen Pendants bekannt. Der Schwerpunkt meiner Doktorarbeit liegt auf südostasiatischen Parabiosen zwischen der myrmicinen Ameise Crematogaster modiglianii Emery 1900 und der deutlich größeren Formicine Camponotus rufifemur Emery 1900. Die beiden Arten nisten häufig gemeinsam in hohlen Bäumen im tropischen Tieflandregenwald Borneos. Die grundlegende Frage meiner Doktorarbeit ist, warum diese beiden Arten zusammenleben. Ich untersuchte sowohl proximate als auch ultimate Aspekte dieser Frage. Zu Vergleichszwecken führte ich Studien über eine trail sharing-Assoziation im selben Lebensraum durch. Auf proximater Ebene untersuchte ich, welche Mechanismen die Toleranz heterospezifischer Nestgenossinnen fördern. Im allgemeinen können Ameisen Nestgenossinnen von fremden Artgenossen mit Hilfe kutikulärer Kohlenwasserstoffen unterscheiden, die als Kolonie-Erkennungssignale dienen. Ich untersuchte Kolonieerkennung innerhalb und zwischen den beiden parabiotischen Arten. Mittels Gaschromatographie-Massenspektrometrie (GC-MS) analysierte ich daneben die kutikulären Substanzen beider Ameisenarten, um etwaige Unterschiede zu verwandten, nichtparabiotischen Arten zu finden, und um abzuschätzen, wie stark die Substanzen beider Arten sich überschneiden. Eine starke Überschneidung würde z. B. dafür sprechen, daß inter¬spezifische Toleranz durch chemische Mimikry verursacht wird. Außerdem untersuchte ich anhand von Biotests die Funktion zweier verschiedener kutikulärer Substanzklassen. Die interspezifische Toleranz zwischen den beiden parabiotischen Arten war artspezifisch, aber nicht koloniespezifisch. Ca. rufifemur tolerierte alle Cr. modiglianii-Arbeiterinnen, auch von fremden Kolonien, attackierte aber Arbeiterinnen anderer Crematogaster-Arten. Cr. modiglianii dagegen duldete Ca. rufifemur-Arbeiterinnen von bestimmten fremden Kolonien, attackierte jedoch diejenigen bestimmter anderer Kolonien. Wie chemische Analysen ergaben, kommt Ca. rufifemur in zwei sympatrischen, chemisch verschiedenen Morphen (‚rote’ und ‚schwarze’ Morphe) vor, die praktisch keine Kohlenwasserstoffe gemeinsam haben. Cr. modiglianii duldete nur diejenigen Ca. rufifemur-Arbeiterinnen, die zur gleichen Morphe gehörten wie ihr eigener Partner. Cr. modiglianii attackierte auch weitere, nichtparabiotische Camponotus-Arten. Gegenseitige interspezifische Toleranz war also auf die Arten Cr. modiglianii und Ca. rufifemur beschränkt. Ca. rufifemur duldete häufig koloniefremde Artgenossen derselben Morphe. Die kleineren Arbeiterinnenkasten wurden eher geduldet als große Arbeiterinnen (Soldaten), möglicher¬weise weil sie 2 - 3 -fach kleinere Kohlenwasserstoffmengen pro Körperoberfläche besitzen als letztere. Im Gegensatz dazu attackierte Cr. modiglianii fast stets koloniefremde Artgenossen. Die Kohlenwasserstoffe beider Arten waren deutlich langkettiger als bei nichtparabiotischen Arten der gleichen Gattungen. Langkettige Kohlenwasserstoffe sind aufgrund ihrer geringeren Flüchtigkeit schwerer wahrzunehmen als kürzerkettige und fördern deshalb vermutlich interspezifische Toleranz. Auffällig war weiterhin, daß die kutikulären Kohlenwasserstoffe bei Ca. rufifemur zu bis zu 98 % aus Methylalkenen bestanden, die als kutikuläre Substanzen bei Insekten höchst ungewöhnlich sind. Cr. modiglianii und Ca. rufifemur besaßen fast keine gemeinsamen Kohlenwasserstoffe, es lag also keine chemische Mimikry vor. Die einzigen gemeinsamen Kohlenwasserstoffe in größeren Mengen waren zwei Methylalkene, die bei der roten Ca. rufifemur-Morphe ca. 89 % des Kohlenwasserstoffprofils ausmachten und auch bei den Cr. modiglianii-Kolonien vorkam, die mit dieser Morphe zusammenlebten. Vermutlich übernahmen diese Cr. modiglianii-Kolonien die beiden Substanzen von ihren roten Ca. rufifemur-Partnern. Cr. modiglianii-Arbeiterinnen waren signifikant weniger aggressiv gegenüber fremden Artgenossinnen, wenn diese mit derselben Ca. rufifemur-Morphe assoziiert waren wie sie selbst. Diese Art schien demnach die Kohlenwasserstoffe, die sie von ihrem Parabiosepartner übernommen hatte, als Erkennungssignale zu nutzen. Neben den Kohlenwasserstoffen kam auf der Kutikula beider Ameisenarten eine Reihe bisher unbekannter Stoffe vor. Die quantita¬tive Zusammen¬setzung dieser Substanzen variierte zwischen parabiotischen Nestern, ähnelte sich aber jeweils zwischen den beiden Arten eines Nests. Sie werden wahrscheinlich in der Dufourdrüse von Cr. modiglianii produziert und auf den Ca. rufifemur-Partner übertragen werden. Als mögliche Übertragungsmechanismen kommen interspezifische Trophallaxis sowie ‚Besteigeverhalten’ in Betracht, bei dem Cr. modiglianii auf Ca. rufifemur-Arbeiterinnen klettert, ohne von diesen vertrieben zu werden. Obwohl die Zusammensetzung der unbekannten Substanzen stark zwischen parabiotischen Nestern variierte, dienten sie – im Gegensatz zu den Kohlenwasserstoffen – nicht der Kolonieerkennung. Sie reduzierten jedoch signifikant die Aggressivität von Ca. rufifemur. Die ultimaten, also ökologischen und evolutionären Aspekte meiner Doktorarbeit beschäftigen sich mit potentiellen Kosten und Nutzen, die Cr. modiglianii und Ca. rufifemur aus ihrer parabiotischen Lebensweise ziehen könnten, mit ihren Interaktionen zu weiteren Arten sowie populationsgenetischen Analysen. Meine Untersuchungen zu einer trail sharing-Assoziation zwischen drei anderen Ameisenarten beschäftigen sich mit zwei Mechanismen, die trail sharing verursachen oder fördern könnten. Ob Parabiosen parasitisch, kommensalistisch oder mutualistisch sind, ist weitgehend unbekannt und hängt von den Kosten und Nutzen ab, die beiden Partnern durch die Parabiose entstehen. Ich untersuchte deshalb Nahrungskonkurrenz (als eine der wahrscheinlichsten Kosten), Nischendifferenzierung in bezug auf die Nahrungssuche (was die Konkurrenz verringern könnte), sowie mehrere etwaige Nutzen aus der parabiotischen Lebensweise. Darüber hinaus untersuchte ich Interaktionen zwischen den Ameisen und dem Hemiepiphyten Poikilospermum cordifolium. Die Nischen der beiden Arten in bezug auf Fouragierdistanz vom Nest, tageszeitliche Aktivitätsspanne und Nahrungspräferenzen. Keine der beiden Arten vertrieb die Partnerart gewaltsam von Ködern, so daß keine direkte Konkurrenz erkennbar war. Für beide Ameisenarten sind eine Reihe von Vorteilen aus der parabiotischen Lebensweise denkbar. Darunter fallen interspezifisches Spurfolgeverhalten, gemeinsame Nestverteidigung, Bereitstellung von Nistraum durch die Partnerart, Nahrungsaustausch mittels Trophallaxis und gegenseitige Brutfürsorge. Wenn eine Ameisenart der Pheromonspur einer anderen Art folgt, erreicht sie Nahrungsressourcen, die die andere Art gefunden hat. Wie durch künstliche Pheromonspuren gezeigt wurde, folgte Ca. rufifemur tatsächlich Spuren von Cr. modiglianii, jedoch nicht umgekehrt. Ca. rufifemur profitierte damit vom Wissen ihrer Partnerart über Nahrungsressourcen (informationaler Parasitismus). Cr. modiglianii wiederum schien von der Nestverteidigung durch Ca. rufifemur zu profitieren. Ca. rufifemur-Soldaten sind deutlich größer als Cr. modiglianii-Arbeiterinnen. Obwohl Cr. modiglianii oft ebenfalls effektiv das Nest verteidigte, erscheint es wahrscheinlich, daß diese Art einen Nutzen aus der Nestverteidigung durch Ca. rufifemur zieht. In neotropische Parabiosen (Ameisengärten) spielen mutualistische Epiphyten durch die Bereitstellung von Nistraum eine große Rolle. Die neotropische Camponotus-Art nützt ihrem Crematogaster-Partner, indem sie Epiphytensamen pflanzt, wozu Crematogaster zu klein ist. Die Parabiosen Borneos waren ebenfall oft von dem Hemiepiphyten Poikilospermum cordifolium (Barg. -Petr.) Merr (Cecropiaceae) besiedelt. Keimlinge und größere Individuen von P. cordifolium wuchsen häufig an parabiotischen Nesteingängen. P. cordifolium bietet jedoch keinen Nistraum und ist daher, abgesehen von der Bereitstellung nahrhafter Elaiosomen, Perianthe und extrafloralem Nektar, für die Ameisen von geringerer Bedeutung als die Epiphyten der Neotropen. Als Fazit erscheint die Parabiose für beide Ameisenarten vorteilhaft. Die wichtigsten Vorteile sind Nestverteidigung (für Cr. modiglianii) und interspezifisches Spurfolgen (für Ca. rufifemur). Allerdings scheint Ca. rufifemur stärker von seinem Partner abzuhängig zu sein als umgekehrt. Von beiden parabiotischen Arten analysierte ich mitochondriale DNA aus verschiedenen Regionen Borneos. Nach meinen Ergebnissen existieren vermutlich vier genetisch und chemisch verschiedene, aber nah miteinander verwandte Camponotus rufifemur-Morphen. Im Gegensatz dazu zeigte Crematogaster modiglianii hohe genetische Differenzierung zwischen entfernten Populationen, aber keine weitere Differenzierung in genetische oder chemische Morphen. Dieses Ergebnis spricht gegen eine morphen-spezifische Cocladogenese zwischen Cr. modiglianii und Ca. rufifemur, obwohl eine weniger spezifische Coevolution der beiden Arten sehr wahrscheinlich ist. In den Regenwäldern Borneos sind trail sharing-Assoziationen zwischen Polyrhachis (Polyrhachis) ypsilon Emery 1887 und Camponotus (Colobopsis) saundersi Emery 1889 weit verbreitet und schließen oft weitere Arten wie Dolichoderus cuspidatus Smith 1857 ein. Ich untersuchte eine trail sharing-Assoziation zwischen diesen drei Arten und erforschte zwei Mechanismen, die eine solche Assoziation eventuell fördern könnten: interspezifisches Spur-folgeverhalten und differentielle interspezifische Aggression. In Spurfolge¬versuchen folgte D. cuspidatus regelmäßig künstlichen Extraktpfaden der anderen beiden Arten. Auf diese Weise parasitierte D. cuspidatus wahrscheinlich auf deren Informationen über Nahrungsressourcen. Im Gegensatz dazu folgten nur wenige Arbeiterinnen von P. ypsilon und Ca. saundersi heterospezifischen Extraktpfaden. Die Assoziation zwischen P. ypsilon und Ca. saundersi kann folglich nicht dadurch erklärt werden, daß fouragierende Arbeiterinnen heterospezifischen Pheromonspuren folgen. In diesem Fall könnte trail sharing möglicherweise darauf beruhen, daß einige wenige scouts heterospezifischen Spuren folgen und anschließend ihre eigene Spur legen. Die interspezifische Aggression zwischen P. ypsilon, Ca. saundersi und D. cuspidatus war stark asymmetrisch, denn Ca. saundersi war gegenüber den anderen beiden Arten stark submissiv. Alle drei Arten unterschieden heterospezifische Arbeiterinnen von ihrem eigenen und einem fremden Standort. Es erscheint daher wahrscheinlich, daß die Arten eines trail sharing-Standorts sich aneinander gewöhnen. Differentielle Toleranz durch dominante Ameisenarten könnte zustande kommen, indem sich diese selektiv an bestimmte submissive Arten gewöhnen, sie dulden und auf diese Weise die Zusammensetzung von trail sharing-Assoziationen beeinflussen...|$|E
