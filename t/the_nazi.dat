5|$|A {{few months}} after <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> seizure of power in Germany in January 1933, Eichmann lost his job due to {{staffing}} cutbacks at Vacuum Oil. <b>The</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party was banned in Austria around the same time. These events were factors in Eichmann's decision to return to Germany.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party {{seized power}} on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was swiftly scrapped; a ruling on 12 March {{established}} two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and {{the flag of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party.|$|E
5|$|Both Heinrich George and Werner Krauss {{were placed}} under arrest {{because of their}} past {{affiliation}} with <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> party. Although Heinrich George {{had been a member}} of the German Communist Party before <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> takeover, he was nonetheless interned as a Nazi collaborator at the Soviet special camp in Sachsenhausen where he died in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{following}} the German occupation of Sarny, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> pemitted Ukrainians to loot Jewish assets, over a three day period. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> also commandeered Jews as forced labour. Subsequent to the permitted looting by Ukrainians, the Jews of Sarny {{were forced to}} turn over most assets to <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> with orders largely enforced by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, a volunteer organization established by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> and sympathizers {{published}} many books. Most of {{the beliefs}} {{that would become}} associated with <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> such as German nationalism, eugenics and anti-Semitism had been in circulation since the 19th century, and <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> seized on this body of existing work in their own publications.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> rose {{to power}} in 1933 all the {{newspapers}} of <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> celebrated in capital letters. But the national press was celebrating as well, the German media proprietor Alfred Hugenberg himself {{was the leader of}} the DNVP, a party that was supporting <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b>|$|R
5|$|From {{the time}} he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute {{regarding}} his membership in <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party. He had maintained that the Venice Agreement meant that he {{and other members of the}} Styrian Home Guard had been accepted into <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party with prestigious low membership numbers corresponding to the dates of their entry into the Home Guard. However, the treasurer of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party, Franz Xaver Schwarz did not accept the Agreement and determined that the members of the Styrian Home Guard were not automatically transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party. This became an issue when Hitler decided to mark the 10th anniversary of his seizure of power and tasked his private secretary and head of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, to determine who should be issued one of a strictly limited number of Golden Party Badges to mark the anniversary. Meyszner, who had been recommended by Himmler, accepted that his party membership was retrospectively determined to be 1 June 1938 and he was allocated a party number of 6,119,650. Thus he effectively joined <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party as late as 1943. Due to these decisions, Meyszner did not qualify as an Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter) and Himmler had to intervene on behalf of Meyszner to ensure he received the badge. Meyszner was one of only five SS men that Himmler deemed worthy of this particular award.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazi</b> anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning {{smoking in}} trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement {{did not have much}} effect {{in the early years of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party, which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party.|$|E
50|$|A prince flees Austria when <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{take over}} and settles in London. He {{encounters}} a beautiful Austrian émigré who makes him realize his mistake in leaving. He strikes a deal with <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> to return in exchange for some Austrian prisoners, but discovers that <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{are not to be}} trusted.|$|R
500|$|Eventually, Mulder {{is taken}} to the ballroom by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> Once there, he is ordered to {{identify}} the scientist, or <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> will begin shooting passengers. After they have killed two men, a woman who looks strikingly like Scully tells <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> that they are killing innocent people for nothing, and that Mulder knows nothing. Mulder tells <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{that one of the}} men they shot was the scientist, but the true scientist steps forward. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> prepare to execute Mulder and [...] "Scully", but before they are able, the engine is shut down. British sailors descend upon the ballroom and begin fighting <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> In <b>the</b> midst of the chaos, Mulder and [...] "Scully" [...] escape. Meanwhile, Scully and the Lone Gunmen find the Queen Anne and board it, only to find that it is an empty ghost ship.|$|R

5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored {{the custom of}} playing <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> regime a propaganda coup.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>the</b> far-right monarchists, the reactionary German National People's Party (DNVP), and others, such as monarchist {{officers}} in the German Army and several prominent industrialists, formed an alliance {{in opposition to the}} Weimar Republic on 11 October 1931 in Bad Harzburg, officially known as the [...] "National Front", but commonly referred to as the Harzburg Front. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> stated that <b>the</b> alliance was purely tactical and they continued to have differences with <b>the</b> DNVP. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> described <b>the</b> DNVP as a bourgeois party and they called themselves an anti-bourgeois party. After the elections of 1932, the alliance broke down when the DNVP lost many of its seats in <b>the</b> Reichstag. <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> denounced them as [...] "an insignificant heap of reactionaries". The DNVP responded by denouncing <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> for their socialism, their street violence, and the [...] "economic experiments" [...] that would take place if <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> ever rose to power.|$|R
50|$|On October 31, 1942, Spira's wife Perel {{was killed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> <b>The</b> rest of his family, among them his brothers, Rabbi Eliezer of Ribaditch, and Rabbi Meir of Bluzhev, were all killed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{started to}} terrorize Jews, many emigrated. Twenty weeks after <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> seized power, <b>the</b> number of Jewish Pomeranians had already dropped by eight percent.|$|R
5|$|Born in Munich, Schreck {{served in}} World War I and shortly {{afterwards}} joined right-wing paramilitary units. He joined <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party in 1920 {{and developed a}} close friendship with Adolf Hitler. Schreck was {{a founding member of}} the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Department"; SA) and was active in its development. Later in 1925, he became the first leader of the Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS). He then served for a time as a chauffeur for Hitler. Schreck developed meningitis in 1936 and died on 16 May. Hitler gave him a state funeral which was attended by several members of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> elite with Hitler delivering the eulogy.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> came {{to power}} in January 1933. A planned arrest of Eckener in 1933 was blocked by Hindenburg. Hitler met Eckener only one time, in July 1933, but the two barely spoke. Eckener did not make any secret of his dislike of <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> and <b>the</b> {{disastrous}} events he foresaw. He criticised the regime frequently, and refused to allow <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> to use <b>the</b> large hangars at Frankfurt for a rally. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> declared Eckener to be persona non grata and his name was no longer allowed to appear in print.|$|R
50|$|In early March 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> arrested Yefremov {{and other}} members of his team. One member, A. A. Breyer, not wanting to {{surrender}} to <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> threw himself under a train.|$|R

5|$|From 1936 to 1945, {{the lion}} {{was once again}} {{replaced}} by an eagle, only this time the one of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> party, the Reichsadler. Deemed the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (Capital of the Movement), Munich was a significant place in terms of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> ideology. The city was home to the NSDAP headquarters, the Beer Hall Putsch and also saw the establishment of Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp. Post-war designs were not pursued until 1949.|$|E

50|$|In 1933, {{just before}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> came to power, the family left Germany, fearful because Alfred Kerr had openly criticised <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> Alfred Kerr's books were burned by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{shortly after he}} fled Germany. The family {{travelled}} first to Switzerland {{and then on to}} France, before finally settling in Britain, where Judith Kerr has lived ever since. She subsequently became a naturalised British subject.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{claimed to}} scientifically measure a strict {{hierarchy}} of human race; the [...] "master race" [...] {{was said to}} be the most pure stock of the Aryan race, which was narrowly defined by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> as being identical with the Nordic race, followed by other sub-races of the Aryan race. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Nazis</b> said that since Western civilization, created and maintained they asserted mostly by Nordics, was obviously superior to other civilizations, then the [...] "Nordic" [...] peoples were superior to all other races and thus, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> believed, they were entitled to world domination. This concept is known as Nordicism.|$|R
