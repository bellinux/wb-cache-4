There is paucity of literatures in this field. Therefore, it <b>was</b> aimed <b>to</b> describe the daily job life of a medical representative based on close observations. Authors gained insights from unstructured interview of medical representatives, marketing personnel, training department personnel of the representative and top executives of pharmaceutical companies. Medical representatives <b>are</b> working <b>with</b> intense sales pressure, very little holiday, huge job insecurity and very little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> family in a biphasic job schedule. This article will provide a glimpse to the job seekers to compare their options and hope to draw attention of the policy makers to make the job more attractive...|$|R

30|$|There’s never <b>been</b> {{a better}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a worker <b>with</b> special skills {{or the right}} education, because these people can use {{technology}} to create and capture value.

The alternative perspective is that the accelerating convergence of digital and biotechnologies, with some level of artificial intelligence, will augment human creativity and labour. Machines will do the all the boring, dirty, and unsafe work. There will be more and different opportunities for everyone to create value and to contribute to society.|$|R

30|$|The Repast Simphony core {{plug-ins}} provide major simulation functions, including time scheduling, space management, behavior activation, {{and random}} number generation (North et al. 2007). Repast Simphony space management uses contexts and projections. Repast Simphony provides a discrete event time scheduler that uses double precision real numbers for event times. The scheduler also allows events <b>with</b> otherwise identical <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> differentiated <b>with</b> an optional priority ranking. The Repast scheduler offers imperative scheduling and declarative scheduling for both sequential and concurrent activities, as discussed {{later in this}} section.|$|R

5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision with Bobby Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new crew chief. She struggled during her rookie season, and <b>was</b> unable <b>to</b> attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it <b>was</b> due <b>to</b> Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson spoke for Women in Sports, and attended meetings of several associations and business groups while taking the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> her children. She separated from Jeff Clark in early 2002, but both remained on good terms.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} basic design of Cost-Carrying Packets (CCP), a novel routing {{framework}} to achieve disruption-free intra-domain routing. Under CCP, each packet carries a short label {{to indicate the}} remaining path cost to reach its destination. Downstream routers use path costs carried by packets and their locally computed path costs to detect inconsistent forwarding paths and repair the inconsistencies using pre-computed paths. The preliminary simulation results suggest that CCP can shorten the service disruption <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commensurate <b>with</b> the failure detection time without delaying routing convergence.

50|$|For example, the Deep Space Network forms one {{component}} of the Gravity Science experiment on Juno. This includes special communication hardware on Juno and uses its communication system. The DSN radiates a Ka-band uplink, which is picked up by Juno's Ka-Band communication system and then processed by a special communication box called KaTS, and then this new signal is sent back the DSN. This allows the velocity of the spacecraft over <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined <b>with</b> a level of precision that allows a more accurate determination of the gravity field at planet Jupiter.|$|R
50|$|As {{it turns}} out, worked {{examples}} are {{not appropriate for}} all learners. Learners with prior knowledge of the subject find this form of instruction redundant, and may suffer {{the consequences of this}} redundancy. This has been described as the expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003). It is suggested that worked examples <b>be</b> faded over <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced <b>with</b> problems for practice (Renkl, Atkinson & Maier, 2000). Thus it <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> consider the learner as well as the media while developing worked examples, else learners may not perform as expected.|$|R
50|$|Deep {{intimacy}} {{requires a}} high level of transparency and openness. Conversation is a key point in every emotional intimate relationship. For example, a long-distance relationship is purely based on conversation. A long-distance relationship can be stronger, in comparison to a normal one, because it forces the two partners to enhance the conversation process. This involves a degree of vulnerability that can feel uncomfortable or anxiety-producing to many individuals. These feelings do, however, tend to diminish and even dissolve over time and with practice. Couples who partake in this act of emotional intimacy <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more comfortable <b>with</b> each other. They feel they can share their dreams and their positive characteristics, along with the negative characteristics that they may have. There are great moments and also tough moments that come along within a relationship. Emotional intimacy <b>is</b> being able <b>to</b> communicate your feelings to show how much you care. It <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> practice emotional intimacy in relationships. A lack of emotional intimacy could be solved by taking the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> your partner throughout the duration of your relationships. Many websites suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise <b>is</b> wise <b>to</b> continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy.|$|R

Sebastian slaps him and tells him that he forgives him, {{but what he did}} was wrong, revealing that he wanted his first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> him. Sebastian sees the two men who raped him and Magnus tells Kyle that Sebastian was raped by them and possibly exposed to HIV because of his negligence. Kyle confronts the two men and forces them to get a rapid HIV test at a nearby testing van. The results come back negative and he shows them <b>to</b> Sebastian, who <b>is</b> relieved, but still distant. Joey and Langston still can't talk to Junot and Savannah, who then take it upon themselves to make the first move. Savannah throws Langston her lighter from across the bar and asks her to light her cigarette while Junot flirts with Joey and invites him into the bathroom while he changes into his next dancing costume. The two couples hook up in the bathroom and Joey and Langston toast each other afterward.

50|$|Geoffrey Dean has {{suggested}} that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent <b>with</b> better astrological charts for a related profession. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and <b>times</b> <b>to</b> suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.|$|R

This is certainly an important aspect of the law. However by allowing people to buy insurance through the exchanges and extending Medicaid coverage to millions of people, the ACA also largely ends workers' dependence on their employer for insurance.
