They got off their horses and made a stand but it was no use. Their horses ran down the ravine right into the village. The squaws caught them as fast as they came.

They were really afraid she would lose her reason if she did not do something.|$|R

He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> asked who he was, we were to tell them his name was Bill Proger. We don't really know where he got the name from, but it's been a running joke since 1991 when it happened Laughs. It started as a working title. The song was just called [...] "Bill Proger."

Today, KIPP Schools have added Pre-K through 12th grade schools.

30|$|The {{participants}} went even further. During the interviews, {{many of them}} mentioned {{patterns that}} made (and make) them think about possible design problems in the class they build.

They also mentioned how they detect coupling issues. According to them, the abusive use of mocking objects indicates that the class under testing has coupling issues. These small patterns match with the cited Feathers’ opinion [33]; a class that is hard to test probably has design issues.|$|R

Citing the Eighth Army order of July 26 to stop refugees, the Korean report concluded that the 7th Cavalry was [...] "likely to have used all possible means to stop the approaching refugees." [...] Said South Korea's national security director, Oh Young-ho, [...] "We believe there was an order to fire." [...] A joint U.S.-Korean [...] "Statement of Mutual Understandings" [...] issued with the reports did not repeat the U.S. report's flat assertion that no orders to shoot were issued at No Gun Ri.|$|R

60|$|But {{there was}} no remedy but to wait till we made these people {{understand}} English, and to adjourn the story till that time.

5000|$|German actress Hildegard Knef {{had been}} {{cast in the}} role of Frederica Burkhardt, her first lead role in an American film, and arrived in Berlin on June 16.

After their capture in Poland and subsequent release, he <b>told</b> <b>US</b> investigators <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had in fact wedded during their period as prisoners of war, trying unsuccessfully to avoid being turned over to the Soviets for prosecution.

However, Ayman Nour, an influential Egyptian opposition figure and likely presidential candidate called for Cairo’s peace treaty with Israel to be [...] "reassessed".
