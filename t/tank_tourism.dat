40|$|This survey {{measures}} the price elasticity {{of demand for}} fuel. Using unique data set from a petrol station in north Bohemia, short-run demand was estimated as price inelastic, the long-run demand was estimated as price elastic. Fuel prices, population in the Free State of Saxony and excise tax in the Czech Republic are main determinants of the demand for fuel. The impact of new vehicles in Ústí nad Labem Region was not proved. A potential effect of <b>tank</b> <b>tourism</b> was estimated using a variable for the difference between fuel prices in observed petrol station and in Germany. Rise in the price difference by one euro cent leads to increase in gasoline demanded in the observed petrol station on average by 1, 5 %, and by 2 % in diesel demanded...|$|E

40|$|Germany and America go way back. German {{soldiers}} {{fought in}} the American Revolutionary War, and German settlers already had begun finding their way to America before the colonies became a nation. By the 1850 s, many Germans had settled in the Midwest, and they followed the frontier west to the Great Plains. Germans were {{the largest group of}} immigrants arriving in Nebraska between 1854 and 1894, and by 1900, almost 20 percent of the state was first- and second-generation Germans. For the past year, a group of University of Nebraska-Lincoln journalism students has closely examined this foreign country that, perhaps more than any other, helped shape the Cornhusker State. In January, 13 students spent 10 days in Berlin, interviewing Germans in government offices and nightclubs, at universities and mosques. To a large extent, what they found was a tale of two 9 / 11 ’s. Without question, Germany’s long and complicated relationship with the United States – as a source of substantial immigration, as an enemy in two world wars and as a key ally in a protracted East-West Cold War – was changed by the events of Sept. 11, 2001. Germany, less inclined to rely on military power to solve international crises, supported U. S. moves in Afghanistan but not in Iraq, straining relations with the U. S. Since then, Germany’s own security has been tested by global terrorism. But there was an earlier, even more profound 9 / 11 for Germany. On Nov. 9, 1989 – which, when written European-style, with the day before the month, becomes 9. 11. 1989 – Germans began tearing down the Berlin Wall. When the dust settled, the Soviet Union was gone, and Germany – split into East and West for 40 years – was reunited. These two dates – British writer Timothy Garton Ash argues that one marks the end of the 20 th century and the other the beginning of the 21 st – color nearly everything happening today in Germany. Our students’ work was aided immensely by Germany’s Goethe-Institut, especially our Berlin tour guides Gerrit Book and Anna Held, and by the German Foreign Office, which assisted with travel expenses. We {{would also like to thank}} Viola Drath for her help and inspiration, and Wolfgang Drautz, consul general, and Winfried Völkering, vice consul, in the German Consulate General in Chicago.
