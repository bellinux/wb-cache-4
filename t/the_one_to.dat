5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway will be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel {{through a series of}} wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E

5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication {{of the results of the}} expedition in the monumental series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E

This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, Jushin Thunder Liger to take on Wataru Inoue and Ryusuke Taguchi. In a huge twist, Devitt was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> make the final cover on Inoue following a stiff brainbuster. From then on he was officially recognized as a member of the CTU.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface.

5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E
5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles (12.9 million km) away.

5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} 51gravestones {{dating from}} the 17thcentury. The most important monument is the canopied tomb {{of a member of}} the Venables family, which dates from the late 13thcentury; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17thcentury. Formerly inside the church, the tomb contains two figures, male and female, with their hands clasped in prayer. The only one of its kind in Cheshire, it is listed GradeII*, and is a scheduled monument. There are two further notable memorials in the churchyard, one to the north and the other to the south of the Venables tomb. Both are in yellow sandstone, date from the medieval period, and include weathered recumbent effigies. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg. The churchyard also contains a sundial, consisting of two octagonal steps that were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar. In addition to being listed, it is also a scheduled monument. The gateway to the churchyard dates from the 17thcentury, and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet. All of these structures are listed as GradeII. The churchyard contains the war graves of 16British servicemen, 15of World War I, and one of World War II. A yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be over 1,000years old.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} grand Shakespeare edition was {{conceived}} at a dinner at Josiah Boydell’s home in November 1786.

Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, he was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> seize and pursue it.

5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible.

Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes.

5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he should be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> bring Jason full circle {{in terms of his}} look from child to man.

Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
