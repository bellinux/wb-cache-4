People with this <b>theme</b> <b>display</b> {{a very different}} set of symptoms than those actually experiencing an actual crisis in sexuality. One major difference {{is that people who}} have HOCD report being attracted sexually towards the opposite sex prior to the onset of HOCD, while homosexual people whether in the closet or repressed have always had such same-sex attractions. The question [...] "Am I gay?" [...] takes on a pathological form. Many people with this type of obsession are in healthy and fulfilling romantic relationships, either with members of the opposite sex, or the same sex (in which case their fear would be [...] "Am I straight?").|$|E

40|$|Landscape narrative, {{combining}} {{landscape and}} narrative, has been employed to create storytelling layouts and interpretive information in some famous botanic gardens. In {{order to assess}} the educational effectiveness of using "landscape narrative" in landscape design, the Heng-Chun Tropical Botanical Garden in Taiwan was chosen as research target for an empirical study. Based on cognitive theory and the affective responses of environmental psychology, computer simulations and video recordings were used to create five <b>themed</b> <b>display</b> areas with landscape narrative elements. Two groups of pupils watched simulated films. The pupils were then given an evaluation test and questionnaire, to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} landscape narrative. When the content was well associated and matched with the narrative landscape, the comprehension and retention of content was increased significantly. The results also indicated that visual preference of narrative landscape scenes was increased. This empirical study can be regarded as a successful model of integrating landscape narrative and interpretation practice that {{can be applied to the}} design of new <b>theme</b> <b>displays</b> in botanic gardens to improve both the effectiveness of interpretation plans and the visual preference of visitors.

40|$|The {{specific}} works {{analyzed in}} this thesis will be Sula and Beloved by Toni Morrison, and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. I have chosen these novels for their significance in the African-American literary canon, and for qualities that were assessed over time. While {{the choice of the}} novels Beloved and The Color Purple is justified by The Pulitzer Prize, Sula - which is, among other things, a novel depicting the moral and physical decline of the main heroine - was selected to contrast with Walker's bildungsroman. However, the central theme of these novels that will be explored is a black woman and her questionable representation in literature. In their novels, Morrison and Walker find diverse solutions to the problematic nature of the place of black women in a patriarchal society. Nevertheless, the selected fiction will be explored separately in terms of the feminist/womanist aspects of Morrison's and Walker's works. The Conclusion will focus on a comparison of the selected works by Toni Morrison and Alice Walker. Thus, attention will be paid to the significant <b>themes</b> <b>displayed</b> in the novels such as racism and the limitations of gender roles. The objective of this analysis will be to find some common <b>themes</b> <b>displayed</b> in the authors' fiction that connect their understanding of the world, such as issues of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|While {{there are}} {{relatively}} few cases from {{the nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries that mention Muslims or Islam, an analysis of these cases discloses three common themes. First, Islam was seen as a decidedly non-American religion.

Third, religious tolerance extended beyond traditional Christian ideologies to encompass Islam, at least in theory if not in practice. These three <b>themes</b> <b>display</b> how judges used often-faulty notions of Muslims and Islam to justify their conclusions, and highlight the genesis of many stereotypes and insensitivities still prevalent in the modern era...|$|R
