5|$|With {{help from}} her friends Bolo and Sky and her {{acquaintance}} Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves {{three of the}} stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the sky scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to {{a place called the}} Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for her courage, but at the price of never seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> that it was probably for the better.|$|E
25|$|Pélissier called Anquetil, who was {{surprised}} and flattered <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and offered him 30,000 old francs a month to ride for La Perle as an independent, or semi-professional. Anquetil accepted and immediately ordered a new car, a Renault Fregate, which he crashed twice in the first 12 months.|$|E
25|$|McPherson {{returned}} to Barrow Shipbuilders {{at the end}} of the season, and played in their 1919–20 FA Cup Preliminary Round defeat to Kells White Star; however, in October 1919, he was signed by Midland League club Chesterfield Municipal, who – either ignoring his cup-tied status or unaware of it entirely – gave him his debut in their FA Cup second qualifying round match against South Normanton Colliery on 25 October; starting at centre-forward, he scored twice as Chesterfield won 5–0. After the match, South Normanton submitted an appeal to The Football Association that McPherson should not have been allowed to play, resulting in Chesterfield being disqualified from the competition and McPherson being banned for a month. Chesterfield manager Tom Callaghan protested that he was unaware that McPherson had already played in the FA Cup that season, but McPherson maintained that he had told his manager he was not available for selection. Callaghan offered McPherson £5 to retract that claim, as well as ordering club captain Peter Irvine to back him up; however, he was found out and sacked from his position, never for the football world <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E

60|$|And it gratified her <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Other {{people had}} such a passion to make {{everything}} of one degree, of one pattern. In England it was chic to be perfectly ordinary. And {{it was a relief}} to her to be acknowledged extraordinary. Then she need not fret about the common standards.|$|R
500|$|At 4.45, Kerr {{received}} Scholes, {{and informed}} {{him of the}} dissolution. Kerr wrote that [...] "nothing else of relevance" [...] took place between the two men, but by Scholes's account, he accused Kerr of bad faith for making an appointment to receive the Speaker, and then not waiting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> before dissolving Parliament. Whitlam later stated {{that it would have}} been wiser for Scholes to take the appropriation bills with him, rather than having them sent ahead.|$|E
500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting for a long time <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2006, as more {{accusations against}} the book {{continued}} to surface, Winfrey invited Frey onto her show. She wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> directly {{whether he had}} lied to her or [...] "simply" [...] embellished minor details, as he had told Larry King. Frey admitted to several of the allegations against him. He acknowledged that The Smoking Gun had been accurate when the website reported that Frey had only spent {{a few hours in}} jail rather than the 87 days Frey claimed in his memoirs.|$|E
60|$|So {{before he}} went home he said that we must not expect <b>to</b> see or <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> any more, unless, of course, things should in some way {{brighten}} up, in which case he would come back.|$|R

2500|$|Josephine {{worked hard}} to conceal Wyatt's prior {{relationship}} to his common-law wife and former prostitute Mattie Blaylock, with whom Wyatt was living when Josephine first met him. While Blaylock was living with Earp, she suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, an opiate-based pain reliever widely available at the time. After Earp left Tombstone and Blaylock, she waited in Colton, California <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> but he never contacted her. She met a gambler from Arizona who {{asked her to marry}} him. She asked Wyatt for a divorce, but Wyatt didn't believe in divorce and refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, who later abandoned her in Arizona. Mattie resumed life as a prostitute and committed [...] "suicide by opium poisoning" [...] on July 3, 1888.|$|E
2500|$|By 1951, the 64-year-old Frawley had {{appeared}} in over 100 movies, but was starting to find film role offers becoming fewer. When he heard that Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting a new television situation comedy, he applied eagerly {{to play the role}} of the cantankerous, miserly landlord Fred Mertz. [...] One evening he telephoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. Ball was surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> — a man she barely knew. Both Ball and Arnaz agreed that it would be great to have Frawley, a motion picture veteran, appear as Fred Mertz. Less enthusiastic were CBS executives, who warned of Frawley's frequent drinking and instability. Arnaz immediately told Frawley about the network's concerns, telling him that if he was late to work, arrived drunk, or was unable to perform because of something other than legitimate illness more than once, he would be written out of the show. Contrary to the network's concerns, Frawley never arrived at work drunk, and in fact mastered his lines after only one reading. Arnaz eventually became one of the misanthropic Frawley's few close friends.|$|E

6000|$|Lucia spoke calmly, {{but there}} was an angry color in her cheek as she rose and left the room. Coventry looked much annoyed, for on Jean's face he {{detected}} a faint smile, half pitiful, half satirical, which disturbed him more than his cousin's insinuation. Bella broke the awkward silence by saying, with a sigh, [...] "Poor Ned! I do so long <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> again <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> I thought a letter had come for some of us. Dean said she saw one bearing his writing on the hall table yesterday." ...|$|R
5000|$|After he dies, Tallis for {{a moment}} imagines the life she might have had if Luc had survived and if she had married him and come {{to live with him}} in Millau: [...] "She {{imagined}} the unavailable future - the boulangerie in a narrow shady street swarming with skinny cats, piano music from an upstairs window, her giggling sisters-in-law teasing her about her accent, and Luc Cornet loving her in his eager way. She wanted to cry for him, and for his family in Millau who would be waiting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> news <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> But she couldn't feel a thing. She was empty." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|R

60|$|He was so earnest {{upon his}} project being {{to be tried}} first, that I could not {{withstand}} him; however, he promised <b>to</b> let me <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in a very little time after his arriving there, {{to let me know}} whether his prospect answered his design, that if there was not a possibility of success, I might take the occasion to prepare for our other voyage, and then, he assured me, he would go with me to America with all his heart.|$|R
50|$|La Scala, Milan, {{where he}} made his debut in 1926, would become his main artistic home, but American audiences did get <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> 1929 until 1933, when he sang at the Metropolitan Opera. His roles at the Met {{included}} Oroveso, Raimondo, Ferrando, Fiesco, Padre Guardiano and Alvise. A performance of Don Giovanni with Pasero singing Leporello and Ezio Pinza singing the Don was broadcast in 1932. Unfortunately, no recording exists of this performance.|$|R
5000|$|Upon its release, D'Kings Men was {{met with}} mixed reviews from music critics. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that [...] "it’s an {{alluring}} contemporary pop album {{with an emphasis on}} king-size dance music, like the militarily efficient “Don’t Tell Me Nonsense” and the flash of last year’s excellent smash hit Oliver Twist." [...] Tayo Ayomide of Nigerian Entertainment Today gave the album a 3.5 out of 5, adding: [...] "On D' Kings Men there are no huge pop anthems like the ones crafted by Don Jazzy in the Mo’ Hits period. What we have on this compilation are strong pop songs hinged on D'Banj's infectious personality and amazing instrumentals." [...] Ogaga Sakapide of TooXclusive followed with 3 out of 5, adding: [...] "Plunging into the usual subjects of partying, love, wealth, fame and success, they manage to craft an experimental LP with numerous emotional layers (mostly pride, lust and anger), however D’banj validates that he might not endowed with the utmost musical gift yet his musical proficiency is praiseworthy." [...] TayoTV gave the album a 6.7 out of 10, adding: [...] "D'banj is an artiste of over a decade and this is an average album. He needs {{to go back to the}} drawing board and give us what we want, give us what we are used <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> during the Mo’Hit days. The people miss the melody of his music. This is his Mo’Hit days. I’m not saying he should or should not go back to Don Jazzy, but he should at least make some meaningful partnerships that will produce hits as an A list artiste and not rubbish." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{went from}} bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael flung his arms round her. 'Mother,' he cried, 'I'm glad of you.' They {{were the last}} words she was <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> for a long time.|$|E
60|$|Here, then, {{we found}} the equerry again, {{consumed}} by anxiety. He leapt forward to greet me, addressing me by the old title of Madonnino which I loved <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> however much that title might otherwise arouse harsh and gloomy memories.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wrote to}} him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, {{and should not}} be {{surprised}} to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{treated me}} badly," [...] Hurd continued, [...] "made {{a fool of}} me before you, and turned me away from Thorpe. I wanted to cry quits with her, and those two got hold of me. Jean le Roi is her husband. She refused <b>to</b> see him--to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Letty Foulton is there, and I {{have been allowed to}} visit her.

5000|$|Sarah Maloy {{wrote for}} Billboard that [...] "See No More" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of the Jonas Brothers' [...] "A Little Bit Longer," [...] but with more fear: [...] "It was so easy to trust you baby/Guess I was so stupid baby/ I did not ever think that this would come/ You're running right to another one," [...] Jonas sings. The first taste of debut solo album [...] "Fast Life" [...] may lack depth, but a strong beat and solid vocal performance position the track as a contender for the stuck-in-your-head song of the summer." [...] Amy Sciarretto from Pop Crunch rated it four out of five stars and says that [...] "he has transitioned from middle Jonas Brother to bona fide pop singer a la Justin Timberlake or Jesse McCartney." [...] Sciarretto also praised the song more mature (relatively speaking) R&B sound, while saying that [...] "he is showing off his chops". Lewis Corner editor of Digital Spy also rated it four stars out of five, saying that [...] "the result is a slice of dramatic synth-pop about adolescent anguish that not only serves as a perfectly executed image overhaul, but sets <b>him</b> apart <b>from</b> certain other males currently Ridin' Solo in the charts." [...] TJ wrote for [...] "Neon Limelight" [...] that the song [...] "finds a maturing Joe trying out different vocal approaches, from a tender falsetto, to a full voice (that, at times, sounds painfully whiny)" [...] and that [...] "his solo introduction is passable, but it does not feel authentic." [...] Jamie Peck wrote for MTV Buzzworthy that [...] "it's a much more mature sound than we are used <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> or any of the Jonases, quite frankly. This R&B-inflected track expresses Joe's frustration at having to wait for his beloved to catch up with him, metaphorically speaking." ...|$|R
6000|$|She then beguiled {{the time}} with designs for gravestones, until she became uneasy at Owen's non-appearance, and longed {{to go and see}} after him; but she fancied he might have spent nights of watching, and thought sleep would be the best means of getting through the {{interval}} which appalled her mind, unused to contact with grief. Still his delay began to wear her spirits and expectation, so long wrought up to the meeting; and she was at least equally restless for the appearance of Robert, wanting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and above all certain that all her dreary cravings and vacancy would be appeased by one dialogue with him, on whatever topic it might be. She wished that she had obeyed that morning bell at St. Wulstan's. It would have disposed of half-an-hour, and she would have met him. 'For shame,' quoth the haughty spirit, 'now that has come into my head, I can't go at all.' ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{was still}} a trifle hazy about the plot, but I had got on {{to the fact that}} Cyril was some sort of an English peer who had come over to America doubtless for the best reasons. So far he had only had two lines to say. One was [...] "Oh, I say!" [...] and the other was [...] "Yes, by Jove!"; but I seemed <b>to</b> recollect, <b>from</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> read his part, that pretty soon he was due rather to spread himself. I sat back in my chair and waited for him to bob up.|$|R
60|$|Jeanie had no {{intention}} to be quite so communicative. She had, as the reader may have observed, some of the caution and shrewdness, {{as well as of}} the simplicity of her country. She answered generally, that the Duke had received her very compassionately, and had promised to interest himself in her sister's affair, and <b>to</b> let her <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in the course of the next day, or the day after. She did not choose to make any mention of his having desired her to be in readiness to attend him, far less of his hint, that she should not bring her landlady. So that honest Mrs. Glass was obliged to remain satisfied with the general intelligence above mentioned, after having done all she could to extract more.|$|R
5000|$|The {{genesis of}} the song [...] "These Kids" [...] {{occurred}} in December 2001 when Turner's brother asked him to compose some music for the lyrics he had written. The track was originally recorded in Cairns, Queensland, with funding from a family friend. It was this demo recording that would later help the group to secure a record contract with Mark Holden, who had been impressed with Turner's beatboxing and guitar skills and had asked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> some songs <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> After the track's release, the group received {{a great deal of}} feedback from young people who identified with the issues mentioned in the song, such as drugs, depression, suicide, and living on the streets.|$|R
