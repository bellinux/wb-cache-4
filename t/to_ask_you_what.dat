And I believe, I don't {{remember}} the quote exactly, but I believe {{you said you had}} checked with a higher authority. I would like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> part does your faith play on your policy decisions? ...|$|E
6000|$|Warn. After my hearty salutations {{upon your}} backside, sir, may a man have leave <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> {{news from the}} Mogul's country? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Turan {{hastened to}} assure him; [...] "I had not {{forgotten}} that. I was about <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the customary amount is." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you, Pat. I think I {{understand}} now. And--oh, yes, there's {{another thing}} I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>What's</b> {{the matter with}} Billie Sheldon?

6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said hurriedly, [...] "I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{may seem a}} very strange question. What was your mother's name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has told}} you {{something}} of me, {{and you have}} believed her?" [...] repeated Mr Maguire. [...] "Have I not a right <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> she has said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{you have done}} with Dinah Moore, whom, I have every ground for believing, you have caused to be kidnaped from my mother's house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! She watches us! If it {{were not}} too absurd, one would believe her jealous. Of course, {{it is not my}} {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> on <b>what</b> terms <b>you</b> are with your wife, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} {{show me a}} {{sufficient}} reason why I should," [...] she answered, [...] "I will not hesitate. But <b>you</b> force me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> directly, <b>what</b> possible concern can it be of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, honest, straight, tell me. I've got {{a chance}} to travel. What d'yuh think of that? Ain't it great! And I'm going right away. <b>What</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> was, <b>what's</b> the best place in Ireland to see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But for Mr. Honeythunder’s eloquence, I {{might have}} had no need <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I am going to ask you. This Mr. Edwin Drood, sir: I think that’s the name?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the by, mamma," [...] said Fred, [...] "I meant <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> that foolish woman meant {{about the}} St. Legers, and their not having {{thoroughly}} approved of Aunt Geoffrey's marriage." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wait a sec," [...] cried Tommy. [...] "There {{are lots}} of things I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Annette. <b>What</b> are <b>you</b> doing in this house? Don't tell me you're Conrad's niece, or daughter, or anything, because I can't believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you haven't," [...] said Abel meditatively. [...] "You {{may think}} <b>you</b> have. <b>What</b> then? First {{thing you know}} you'll be dreaming again--thank the Lord for it. I ain't going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what's</b> soured <b>you</b> on dreaming just now. After awhile you'll begin again, {{especially}} {{if you come to}} this garden as much as I hope you will. It's chockful of dreams--any kind of dreams. You take your choice. Now, I favour dreams of adventures, if you'll believe it. I'm sixty-one and I never do anything rasher than go out cod-fishing on a fine day, but I still lust after adventures. Then I dream I'm an awful fellow--blood-thirsty." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I accuse nobody, sir,' {{said the}} old man, {{standing}} his ground, and speaking steadily, but respectfully, 'I wouldn't say nothing to bring any one into trouble if I could help it, and I came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> was to be done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you for nothing," [...] said Bernard, smiling. [...] "You {{have asked}} me a great many questions; there is one that in turn I have a right <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>What</b> do you propose to do in {{consequence}} of what I have told you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I couldn't rest,' said Florence, 'without coming <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{you think}} about dear Walter--who is my brother now--and whether there is {{anything}} to fear, and whether you will not go and console his poor Uncle every day, until we have some intelligence of him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'PROFESSOR MUFF.--Will <b>you</b> {{allow me}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> sir, of <b>what</b> {{materials}} {{it is intended}} that the magistrates' heads shall be composed? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--er--no, thank <b>you.</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. <b>What</b> is your candid {{opinion of}} those verses Mr Wells was reading just now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{but look}} here. I just want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one question. <b>What</b> {{sort of a}} time did you have in that scratch game tonight?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In London! Ah! {{that reminds}} me I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I am to say to Selina Marchmont. I have a very kind letter from her, asking us to come {{to stay with her}} directly, and hoping that it may be {{arranged}} for us to live with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is nonsense," [...] said she. [...] "I shouldn't be glad {{at all to}} see him disappointed. I {{should feel}} like a traitor if I helped you. But I {{did not come to}} talk about these things. I came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> you would have for dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] said Blakeney, calmly, [...] "of all the [...] . hem! [...] . My friend!--I {{have not}} yet had time <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> you were doing in France, when I ordered you to remain in London? Insubordination? What? Wait till my {{shoulders}} are less sore, and, by God, see the punishment you'll get." ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{instantly}} all there. [...] "Of course I know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> allude <b>to.</b> I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had meant by saying, {{the day you}} came to see me, just before you left me, that you'd save me.

6000|$|... "Certainly not, sir. But I should wish <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> propose <b>to</b> do, in case I {{discover}} the people concerned in the conspiracy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys!" [...] he said, [...] "listen to me a second, I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. <b>What</b> {{on earth}} {{do you think}} we came here for? Simply and solely because we can't bear to go on seeing you killed day after day, month after month, year after year. That's all, and it's Christ's truth. Amen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is about}} her. But {{how did you know}} that? You always {{seem to be able to}} read one's {{thoughts}} before one speaks. Do you know, sometimes I think that she has taken a fancy to me, do you see, and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> you thought about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was brought}} here last time without any {{particular}} desire on my part," [...] she answered, looking {{him in the}} face. [...] "I've come now <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> accursed plot this is against Stephen Laverick? What were you doing in the court this morning, lying? What {{is the meaning of}} it, Arthur?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, godmother,' {{she went}} on, 'I {{particularly}} wish <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{has taken place}} here, since I left the wolf here? Because I have an idea {{about the size of}} a marble, rolling about in my little noddle. First and foremost, are you Pubsey and Co., or are you either? Upon your solemn word and honour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{come this}} time,' he said, 'less because I {{was in this}} {{direction}} than <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs. Clark, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mid well guess. I've come o' purpose, in short.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--everything! Well, well, well!" [...] But {{he pulled}} himself together; he began again to eat. [...] "I came back <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. That's <b>what</b> I came back for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{presumption}} in my {{talking about}} such things," [...] said Lothair; [...] "but might I venture <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may consider the true principles of art?" ...|$|R
