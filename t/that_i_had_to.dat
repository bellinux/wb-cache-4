It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ignore it and do what I thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics are}} autobiographical and portray Azalea's fame-seeking {{relocation}} from Mullumbimby to Miami {{at the age}} of 16, and deal with subjects of work ethic and dedication to craft. It specifically accounts for the events of Azalea growing up in Mullumbimby, juggling multiple occupations to save an income to independently start anew in Miami. The lyrics also serve as a celebration of Azalea's progression from being a struggling rapper as a rags to riches story and an underdog anthem. The line [...] "Who don't know shit 'bout where I was made / Or how many floors <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> scrub," [...] was suggested to be directed at her [...] "haters". While the couplet, [...] "Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt, sugar cane, back lanes" [...] is eloquent for Azalea's origin.|$|E

Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman.

Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend of one of the Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews.

500|$|Pundits {{and coaches}} {{sometimes}} characterized Turner as a quarterback {{who did not}} excel during practices, but executed well on game-day. Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "He's pretty go-with-the-flow. And that's his greatest strength and maybe his greatest weakness. The bottom line is, he plays well in games." [...] The Baltimore Sun wrote that he [...] "seems to play his best when it counts—and his worst when it doesn't." [...] Regarding the 2008 summer practices, offensive coordinator James Franklin said Turner ranked in the middle compared with Jordan Steffy and Josh Portis in terms of completion percentage, fewest interceptions, and [...] "explosive" [...] plays that gained 16 yards or more. Turner conceded that Steffy was a better game-planner during practices. Head coach Ralph Friedgen who had offered critical or subdued assessments of Turners' practice, said his intensity grew after losing the starting position to Steffy prior to the 2008 season.

He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz.

Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E

Badler said that when she met with the writers, they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together. Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours executive producer, Susan Bower and when she tried to get her music featured on the show, she was asked to play Diana instead. Badler said that she still had to audition for the role, which she said was [...] "depressing" [...] as she hates auditioning. However, she said it was fun as the part was for a bad girl, which is the kind of role she enjoys playing.

That's because director Yu wants to make art films. I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you."

He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E
500|$|Dougan {{was sold}} on to Blackburn Rovers {{for a fee}} of £15,000 in March 1959. He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1–1 draw away to Arsenal at Highbury.

Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the 1960 FA Cup Final at Wembley after Dougan scored the winning goal past Sheffield Wednesday in the semi-finals. However, he did not enjoy his time at Ewood Park, and later wrote that [...] "the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that caused me to wake each day regretting <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to the ground. Life was grey and monotonous". This led to him handing in a transfer request the day before the final, which he later admitted was an occasion where his [...] "vanity triumphed over common sense". He was not at full fitness in the final itself, and had a quiet game as Blackburn lost 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers.
