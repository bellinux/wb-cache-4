5|$|He {{spent several}} months of his {{imprisonment}} dictating {{a detailed account of}} his travels <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> inmate, Rustichello da Pisa, who incorporated tales of his own as well as other collected anecdotes and current affairs from China. The book soon spread throughout Europe in manuscript form, and became known as The Travels of Marco Polo. It depicts the Polos' journeys throughout Asia, giving Europeans their first comprehensive look into {{the inner workings of the}} Far East, including China, India, and Japan.|$|E

With Peter's permission, Kulikovsky moved into the 200-room residence in Sergievskaya Street, Saint Petersburg, that Peter shared with Olga. According <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> officer, gossip about a possible romance between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess, based on little more than their holding hands in public, spread through high society.|$|E

Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival. However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is likely to die. She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all the men she kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain the adrenaline rush felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef has gone into remission but is sad to say goodbye. She returns to her cell and informs good friend Anita DeMarco (Lin Tucci) that she is dying before smelling the money she stole from the nurse.|$|E
5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open hostility toward Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who knows all too well about the Chamber, having been witness <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> student’s death fifty years ago. The culprit, he reveals to Harry, was none other than Rubeus Hagrid, now gamekeeper for Hogwarts School; when Hermione is attacked next, alongside a Ravenclaw prefect, the school is put on lockdown, and Dumbledore and Hagrid are forced to leave the premises.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> player.|$|E

25|$|Short {{was briefly}} married <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> student at {{eighteen}} {{after she had}} a baby when she was seventeen.

25|$|Of the {{two main}} routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the Shunpike road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's {{division}} near Shiloh Church. The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so. Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination or indicated a specific route. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing. Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.|$|E
25|$|In November 1873, Carp {{ended his}} {{assignment}} {{and returned to}} the Romanian political scene. He soon after married <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> aristocrat, Sevastia Cantacuzino. Hailing from Cantacuzino boyars, she was the daughter of Ion C. Cantacuzino (who was Carp's political ally). Her mother was Maria Mavros, a direct descendant of the Soutzos clan. Sevastia would have five children from Carp: daughter Elisabeta (Elsa), sons Jean (Ion), Grigore, Petre and Nicu. Meanwhile, the Junimist club, answering a proposal made by Gheorghe Costa-Foru, had agreed to caucus with Catargiu's conservatives. The Catargiu cabinet had Maiorescu as Minister of Education and Religious Affairs, but the latter resigned due to a political scandal. Carp was called in to replace his Junimea colleague, and filled the post for the remaining two months of conservative power.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{suffered}} utter {{decay and}} stagnation {{during the final}} decades of the 17th century. While the rest of Western Europe went through exciting changes in government and society – the Glorious Revolution in England and {{the reign of the}} Sun King in France – Spain remained adrift. The Spanish bureaucracy that had built up around the charismatic, industrious, and intelligent Charles I and Philip II demanded a strong and hardworking monarch; the weakness and lack of interest of Philip III and Philip IV contributed to Spain's decay. Charles II was mentally retarded and impotent. He was therefore childless, and in his final will he left his throne to a French prince, the Bourbon Philip of Anjou, rather than <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> Habsburg, albeit from Austria. This resulted in the War of the Spanish Succession.|$|E

25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed {{to enter into the}} Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E
