5|$|A second U.S. leg {{began in}} March 2017, {{with support from}} the Naked and Famous and Wavves. The band will embark on a European tour between June and July 2017, {{including}} spots at the Nova Rock Festival, the I-Days Festival, Hurricane Festival and Southside Festival, Roskilde Festival, and the Download Festival.

5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments {{were conducted in}} 2015 to attempt to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide were observed, with ΔHadsCn(t-Se) > 48kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as {{the stability of the}} group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> the group 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E
5|$|In April 1847, chosen {{members of}} the vanguard company gathered, final {{supplies}} were packed, and the group was organized into 14 military companies. A militia and night guard were formed. The company consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight {{members of the}} Quorum of the Twelve, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, draft animals, and livestock, and carried enough supplies to provision <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> one year. On April 5, the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin.|$|E

5|$|In late 2000, 3 Count {{began to}} fall apart, with Moore and Helms kicking Karagias out of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> {{continually}} stealing the spotlight. Karagias joined forces with former Jung Dragons member Jamie Knoble and the three teams met in a Triangle match at Mayhem, which 3 Count won. At Starrcade, the six men faced off in a ladder match for the number contendership to the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Both Moore and Helms grabbed the contract at the same time, and later wrestled {{for the opportunity to}} face the champion, which Helms won.|$|E
5|$|Maggie asks <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> help {{to remove}} a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E

5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career for Ross {{and contributed to the}} {{professional}} and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E
5|$|The show follows {{several groups}} of meerkats, who act communally {{for the benefit}} of the groups in which they live. These groups are {{typically}} led by a dominant female and male, who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. This group was chosen because of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> five years. During series three, Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} of the serial crime-thriller {{television}} series Millennium commenced airing in the United States on October 2, 1998, and concluded on May 21, 1999 after airing twenty-two episodes.

5|$|During the hiatus, the Loaded members {{continued}} to work on various projects. Reading formed the group The Disciples (that later became The Chelsea Smiles) with Christian Martucci, Todd Youth, and Howie Pyro. Rouse would release another album with Alien Crime Syndicate, titled Ten Songs in the Key of Betrayal, who went on the perform as Tommy Stinson's backing band {{in support of his}} solo album Village Gorilla Head. Following the tour, Rouse joined Vendetta Red, replacing previous bassist Michael Vermillion, on their tour in support of their latest album Sisters of the Red Death. However, they disbanded in March 2006, with Rouse and former Vendetta Red members Zach Davidson and Leif Andersen, as well as local drummer Ben Libay, forming the group Sirens Sister. They released one album in 2006, before Rouse left the group in 2007. Squires re-joined The Long Winters, having been a member prior to joining Loaded, playing with <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> less than a year before departing.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{his fellow}} band members, Fafa – born 13 May 1954 in Ampasamadinika, a {{neighborhood}} of Antananarivo – has based his career entirely around singing. He {{was raised in a}} musical family: his father played mandolin and his mother enjoyed singing. Fafa began playing guitar at the age of nine and sang along with popular European and American artists on the radio, including Harry Belafonte, Claude François and Mike Brant. Fafa discontinued his studies after the 1972 rotaka and returned with his wife and son (born in 1973) to live with his parents in Antananarivo. There he obtained a position at the Ministry of Transportation, becoming the first salaried member of <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> <b>For</b> the first three decades of his career, Fafa often recorded and performed in collaboration with other artists and groups. He released his first solo album in 2008 to strong sales across Madagascar. In the late 1990s Fafa led a successful campaign to increase access to public latrines in the impoverished Antananarivo neighborhood of Isotry.|$|E
5|$|Zaphod, {{named after}} Zaphod Beeblebrox from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was Flower's devoted partner and the {{dominant}} male of the Whiskers. As Zaphod assumed both roles by usurping, {{he tended to}} be edgy if Yossarian got too close to Flower. According to the Meerkat Manor: The Series Begins film, Zaphod was a roving Lazuli male before he joined the Whiskers. He was really born in the Vivian, not the Lazuil. He and his younger brother, Yossarian, visited the Whiskers {{at the same time}} in search of females. Flower's sister Viale, then the dominant female, chose Yossarian as her mate and he became the group's dominant male. Zaphod and Flower also mated, but Viale killed the resulting pups. After Viale's death, Flower assumed the role of dominant female and showed preference to Zaphod for her mate. Yossarian then left <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>for</b> an unknown length of time.|$|E
