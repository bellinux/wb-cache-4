5|$|The usual form of {{diamond in}} cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
5|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) has a {{hardness}} {{equivalent to}} sapphire and carborundum (9.0 on the Mohs Scale), {{and is often}} used <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> cutting tools, such as drill bits. It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication. Titanium carbide, which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E

50|$|Established in 1935 as a {{renumbering}} of NC 221, {{the second}} and current NC 50 traversed from Newton Grove <b>to</b> <b>Coats,</b> through Benson. In 1937, NC 50 was rerouted on new primary routing north from Benson to US 70, in Garner; its old alignment <b>to</b> <b>Coats</b> was replaced by NC 40.|$|R
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
50|$|Matings between hairless AHTs {{will produce}} {{completely}} hairless litters. Between hairless AHT <b>to</b> <b>coated</b> AHT or Rat Terrier, results are more variable and will produce mixed hairless litters <b>to</b> all <b>coated</b> litters.|$|R

50|$|IMO PSPC (performance {{standard}} for protective coatings) regulations set a {{maximum allowable concentration}} of soluble salts on a surface <b>to</b> be <b>coated,</b> measured as sodium chloride, of 50 mg•m−2. The maximum amount of salt allowed on a surface prior <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> application is typically determined by the coating supplier and the user, such as a shipyard. Standard values have not been established.|$|R
25|$|The name Ipoh {{is derived}} from a local tree, Pohon Epu or now more {{commonly}} known as Pokok Ipoh. The sap of this plant is poisonous and was used by Orang Asli (indigenous peoples in Malay) <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> {{the tips of the}} darts of their blowpipes for hunting.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial plants make leaf waxes <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> the {{surfaces}} of their leaves as an adaptation to minimize water loss. These waxes are largely straight-chain n-alkyl lipids. They are insoluble, non-volatile, chemically inert, and resistant to degradation, making them easily preserved in the sedimentary record, and therefore good targets as biomarkers.|$|E

It is often also used to {{sprinkle}} over artisan breads and baked in traditional form <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> the smooth dough, especially on whole-wheat flatbreads or artisan nutrition bars, such as alegrías.|$|E
50|$|Although {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} {{have been applied}} to the insides of exhaust system components, problems have been encountered {{because of the difficulty}} in preparing the internal surface prior <b>to</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bresle {{method is}} used to {{determine}} concentration of soluble salts on metal surfaces prior <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> application, such as painting. These salts can cause serious adhesion problems after time.|$|R

Capped players have six martlets on their sweaters, and the crest with gold {{trimming}} on their caps; uncapped players instead have only the club crest on their left breast, and white trimming on their caps.|$|E
25|$|Many anti-reflection lenses {{include an}} {{additional}} coating that repels water and grease, making them easier to keep clean. Anti-reflection coatings are particularly suited to high-index lenses, as these reflect more light without the coating than a lower-index lens (a {{consequence of the}} Fresnel equations). It is also generally easier and cheaper <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> high index lenses.|$|E
25|$|From about 1615, the potters began <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> their pots {{completely}} in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They {{then began to}} cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to cobalt blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> {{for some}} biological samples {{is to increase}} the bulk conductivity of the material by impregnation with osmium using variants of the OTO staining method (O-osmium tetroxide, T-thiocarbohydrazide, O-osmium).|$|R

25|$|By 1948, DuPont, which founded Kinetic Chemicals in {{partnership}} with General Motors, was producing over two million pounds (900 tons) of Teflon brand PTFE per year in Parkersburg, West Virginia. An early use was in the Manhattan Project as a material <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> valves and seals in the pipes holding highly reactive uranium hexafluoride at the vast K-25 uranium enrichment plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{several ways}} <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> the inner surface with {{specific}} charges. Diffusion-limited patterning can be utilized because a bulk solution only penetrate {{the entrance of}} a nanochannel within a certain distance. Because the diffusion speed is different for each reactant. By introducing several steps of reactants flowing into the nanochannel, {{it is possible to}} pattern the surface with different surface charges inside the channel.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of plasma polymers as coatings {{has also been}} studied. Plasma polymers formed from tetramethoxysilane have been studied as protective coatings and have shown to increase the hardness of polyethylene and polycarbonate. The use of plasma polymers <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> plastic lenses is increasing in popularity. Plasma depositions are able to easily coat curved materials with a good uniformity, {{such as those of}} bifocals. The different plasma polymers used can be not only scratch resistant, but also hydrophobic leading to anti-fogging effects.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} to PEM coatings are the ability <b>to</b> conformably <b>coat</b> objects (that is, {{the technique is}} not limited <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> flat objects), the environmental benefits of using water-based processes, reasonable costs, and the utilization of the particular chemical properties of the film for further modification, such as the synthesis of metal or semiconductor nanoparticles, or porosity phase transitions to create anti-reflective coatings, optical shutters, and superhydrophobic coatings.|$|R
40|$|Cerium-based {{conversion}} coatings were {{deposited on}} as-cast aluminum alloy 380 substrates by a spontaneous immersion process. In this study, {{the effects of}} rinsing temperature prior to immersion in the coating deposition solution were studied {{with respect to the}} surface morphology, electrochemical response, and corrosion resistance of the coatings. Panels rinsed at 25 °C prior <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> had large cracks and holes in the coating. In contrast, panels rinsed at 100 °C prior <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> had a uniform coating morphology with fewer, smaller cracks. Electrochemical testing revealed that coatings deposited on substrates rinsed at 100 °C had higher impedance (~ 80 [*]kΩ·cm 2) and lower corrosion current (~ 0. 34 [*]μA/cm 2) compared to coatings deposited on substrates rinsed at 25 °C, which had 10 [*]kΩ·cm 2 impedance and 2. 7 [*]μA/cm 2 corrosion current. Finally, ASTM B 117 salt spray testing showed that rinsing at 100 °C prior <b>to</b> <b>coating</b> resulted in cerium-based conversion coatings that could resist the formation of salt tails for at least 8 days...|$|R
