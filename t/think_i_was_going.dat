Writers told me, 'Boy, you really gave it to the producers.' Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the point. I was indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before." ...|$|E

500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I was afraid he would <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E

During her {{acceptance}} speech, Hudson said: [...] "Oh, my God, I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to win. [...] If my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration." [...] She also concluded her speech by thanking Jennifer Holliday.|$|E
2500|$|On October 30, 2010, WWE held a [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] in Hartford, Connecticut. Vince {{acknowledged}} that the event was held to counter the negative publicity from the Senate race. During the wrestling show, McMahon distanced himself from his wife's political campaign, saying, [...] "Some people may <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to talk about politics today. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. I do encourage you to vote this Tuesday, and while you're voting, feel free to wear a WWE T-shirt. I came out here to simply say thank you. That's what this day is all about. It's about fan appreciation. No one appreciates the fans more than World Wrestling Entertainment." [...] The Connecticut Democratic Party filed an FEC complaint against Linda McMahon's campaign in October, claiming the WWE's [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] was an [...] "illegal campaign contribution". The complaint also cited the taping of [...] "Smackdown in Bridgeport Harbor Yard" [...] on Election Day, claiming it intended to suppress voter turnout in a Democratic-leaning community.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} positively; [...] "you are quite mistaken if you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to sleep. Please exert yourself, Miss Emily--I am {{waiting to be}} interested." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to run away? I'll {{stay and}} face him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I guess not!" [...] was the panting answer. [...] "But I--I {{sure did}} <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> over there!" [...] And the shipowner's son shuddered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I did," [...] said Leonidas reproachfully. [...] "Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to let her}} get bit? It {{might have}} killed her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In a sense, no," [...] he replied. [...] "Diplomatically, however, <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{from their}} point of view, a heinous offender. <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> shelved for six months." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you intend to do, Gully; but I mean to bolt. If she <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to stick here {{for the next two}} years she is jolly much mistaken." ...|$|R
