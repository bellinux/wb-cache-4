5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external.

Members of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous.

40|$|Abstract The Y-chromosome haplogroup {{composition}} {{of the population of}} the Cabo Verde Archipelago was profiled by using 32 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers and compared with potential source populations from Iberia, <b>west</b> Africa, and <b>the</b> Middle East. According to the traditional view, the major proportion of the founding population of Cabo Verde was of <b>west</b> <b>African</b> ancestry with <b>the</b> addition of a minor fraction of male colonizers from Europe. Unexpectedly, more than half of the paternal lineages (53. 5 %) of Cabo Verdeans clustered in haplogroups I, J, K, and R 1, which are characteristic of populations of Europe and the Middle East, while being absent in <b>the</b> probable <b>west</b> <b>African</b> source population of Guiné-Bissau. Moreover, a high frequency of J * lineages in Cabo Verdeans relates them more closely to populations of the Middle East and probably provides the first genetic evidence of the legacy of the Jews. In addition, the considerable proportion (20. 5 %) of E 3 b(xM 81) lineages indicates a possible gene flow from the Middle East or northeast Africa, which, at least partly, could be ascribed to the Sephardic Jews. In contrast to <b>the</b> predominance of <b>west</b> <b>African</b> mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in their maternal gene pool, <b>the</b> major <b>west</b> <b>African</b> Y-chromosome lineage E 3 a was observed only at a frequency of 15. 9 %. Overall, these results indicate that gene flow from multiple sources and various sex-specific patterns have been important in the formation of the genomic diversity in the Cabo Verde islands...|$|R

On the outbreak of the First World War, he commanded his battalion on the Western Front as part of an Indian Army formation; when his superior officer was promoted in early 1915, Blackader succeeded him as commander of the brigade, and led it through the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the Battle of Loos.|$|E
5|$|Swells from Fred reached wide {{stretches}} of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> coastline, stirring up high seas {{as far north}} as Senegal. Along the shorelines between Dakar and M'Bour, rough surf devastated entire fishing districts and harbor towns, stranding boats and damaging roads and bridges. About 200houses were demolished in the district of Hann, many of which experienced total wall collapse; dwellings in the town of Bargny endured similar destruction. In the suburb of Rufisque, the waves overtopped dams, entered homes and cemeteries, and destroyed a mosque. Outside the capital area, several villages were completely cut off from their surroundings. Victims across the affected region received more than 100tons (220,000lbs) of rice and 12million CFA francs (US$20,000) in government relief funds.|$|E

The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E

5|$|A second colony was {{established}} at the Arguin archipelago off <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> coast (now part of Mauritania). In contrast to the Guinean colony, Arguin had been a colony before: In 1520, Portugal had built a fort on the main island, which with all of Portugal came under Spanish control in 1580. In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic, and in 1678 by France, who due to high maintenance costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after. On 27 July 1685, an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule, who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October. Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established. France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re-conquer the fort in late 1687, but the attack of a French frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg-Prussian garrison. The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people, {{many of whom were}} carried off as slaves by the French before. While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg, it temporarily advanced to the world's primary staple port for slaves.|$|E

The subjects comprised 149 patients with diagnosis of male infertility, as well as 100 healthy individuals for comparison. The relevant clinical history of each patient was extracted from their case notes. All the subjects had their testes examined using a high frequency (7. 5 MHz) linear transducer of an ultrasound scanner. Images in B-mode ultrasound scan and color Doppler were acquired in the supine and upright position. The results were expressed as percentages and tests of significance were done using the chi-square and Fisher's t-test. A P-value 0. 05), while testicular tumor was confirmed in one sub-fertile patient. With the exclusion of varicocele, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of the other abnormalities between the sub-fertile and fertile groups. ConclusionMale sub-fertility was associated with a higher prevalence of scrotal abnormalities. Apart from the diagnoses of the possible causes of the sub-fertility, routine scrotal US was able to diagnose other abnormalities of clinical relevance in the sub-fertile male. Scrotal US is a valuable tool in the evaluation of <b>the</b> sub-fertile <b>west</b> <b>African</b> man and should be considered in the routine evaluation of <b>the</b> sub-fertile <b>west</b> <b>African</b> man...|$|R
