40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{the effect of a}} power <b>transformer’s</b> <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> on the basic voltage sag {{characteristics}} during unbalanced faults at a meshed or radial power network. Specifically, the propagation of voltage sags through a power transformer is studied with advanced short-circuit analysis. A smart method to incorporate this effect on analytical mathematical expressions is proposed. Based on this methodology, the positive effect of <b>transformers</b> of certain <b>vector</b> <b>groups</b> on the mitigation of the expected number of voltage sags per year (sag frequency) at the terminals of critical industrial customers can be estimated.

50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> is the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) {{method of}} categorizing the high voltage (HV) windings and low voltage (LV) winding configurations of three-phase <b>transformers.</b> The <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> designation indicates the windings configurations {{and the difference}} in phase angle between them. For example, a wye HV winding and delta LV winding with a 30-degree lead is denoted as Yd11.|$|R
50|$|In the IEC <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> code, {{each letter}} stands for {{one set of}} windings. The {{high-voltage}} (HV) winding is designated with an uppercase letter, followed by medium or low-voltage (LV) windings designated with a lowercase letter. The digits following the letter codes indicate the difference in phase angle between the windings, with HV winding is taken as a reference. The number is in units of 30 degrees. For example, a <b>transformer</b> with a <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> of Dy1 has a delta-connected HV winding and a wye-connected LV winding. The phase angle of the LV winding lags the HV by 30 degrees.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses generic {{three phase}} models to {{illustrate}} how the frequency response analysis (FRA) data of distribution <b>transformers</b> with different <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> numbers will be effected by inductive disparity. The inductive disparity of a three phase transformer is a well documented property due to variation in the observed core reluctance of transformer windings on different phases. At low frequency this {{will result in a}} subtle inductance inequality between the centre and outer limb windings of the transformer core. Understanding the influence of this disparity is important when analysing the frequency response of the transformer. Frequency Response Analysis data taken from different terminals on the same transformer will display significant variation at low frequencies due to the effects of this inductive disparity. Effects include differences in the self resonant frequency and levels of attenuation. This research facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the observed responses...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} transcription factor 7 -like 2 (TCF 7 L 2) silence on the expression of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) in insulin resistance (IR) model HepG 2 cells and its possible mechanism. Methods　The HepG 2 cells were divided into blank group, TCF 7 L 2 interference <b>group,</b> empty <b>vector</b> <b>group,</b> IR group, IR+TCF 7 L 2 interference <b>group</b> and IR+empty <b>vector</b> <b>group.</b> IR-HepG 2 cell model was induced by in vitro cultivation of the cells in high concentration of insulin (5 × 10 - 6 mol/L) for 24 hours; GOD-POD and 2 -NBDG method was used to verify successful reproduction of IR-cell model. TCF 7 L 2 specific siRNA lentivirus vector (LV-TCF 7 L 2 -siRNA) was constructed with TCF 7 L 2 mRNA coding sequence as the interference target, and {{it was used to}} transfect the cells in blank group and IR <b>group.</b> Empty <b>vector</b> virus was used to transfect the cells in empty <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> and IR+empty <b>vector</b> <b>group.</b> The expressions of TCF 7 L 2 and IDE mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR, and the changes in the expression of TCF 7 L 2, IDE, insulin stimulated protein kinase B(AKT) and phosphorylated protein kinase B(p-AKT) were detected by Western blotting. The uptake rate of 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 -NBDG) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results　Compared with that in control group, the glucose consumption and the uptake rate of 2 -NBDG significantly decreased in IR group (P< 0. 01), proving that the IR cell model had been reproduced successfully. Western blotting and qRT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of TCF 7 L 2 and IDE mRNA and protein were obviously decreased in IR group compared with that in blank group (P< 0. 05), in TCF 7 L 2 interference group than in blank <b>group</b> and empty <b>vector</b> <b>group,</b> and in IR+TCF 7 L 2 interference group than in blank <b>group</b> and IR+empty <b>vector</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05). After physiological insulin stimulation, the expression levels of p-AKT protein decreased more significantly in IR group and IR+TCF 7 L 2 interference group than in blank group (P< 0. 01), while no statistically significant difference in the total AKT protein level was found among all the groups. 2 -NBDG uptake rate was significantly decreased in TCF 7 L 2 interference group as compared with that in blank <b>group</b> and empty <b>vector</b> <b>group,</b> and also in IR+TCF 7 L 2 interference group than in IR <b>group</b> and IR+empty <b>vector</b> <b>group,</b> respectively P< 0. 01. Conclusion　The mechanism of IR induced by the interaction of TCF 7 L 2 and IDE might be related to the decreased expression of the insulin signaling pathway key enzyme p-AKT protein.
