5|$|A {{well-developed}} tropical wave exited Africa on August 27. The next day, {{it developed}} into a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter it intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. On August 29, it passed just south of Cape Verde as it continued intensifying on its west-northwest <b>track.</b> <b>An</b> eye feature appeared in the convection on August 31, suggesting winds of near hurricane status; since the feature was located {{on the western side}} of the deep convection and the storm was slightly asymmetric, the intensity was held just below hurricane status. Shortly after, strong wind shear caused the storm to deteriorate, leaving the low-level circulation exposed on the western side. Beryl weakened to a tropical depression the next day {{due to the lack of}} convection, and it continued westward without redevelopment. On September 5, a reconnaissance flight into the depression found winds of 65mph (100km/h); this was deemed unrepresentative of the actual intensity as it was recorded in a squall line. The depression became disorganized once more and by September 6, it was no longer identifiable on satellites.|$|E
5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan <b>track</b> (<b>an</b> all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E

We propose to use light to <b>track</b> <b>a</b> moving target in WSNs. To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} work which <b>tracks</b> <b>a</b> moving object by using light sensors and general light sources. We design a novel probabilistic protocol (system) iLight to <b>track</b> <b>a</b> moving target and several efficient methods to compute the target’s moving patterns (like height, moving speed etc.) at the same time. We implement and evaluate our tracking system iLight in a testbed consisting of 40 sensor nodes, 10 general light sources and one base station. Through extensive experiments, we show that iLight can <b>track</b> <b>a</b> moving target efficiently and accurately. I...|$|R
