He participated in the August 7 AFL-CIO Debate and the August 19 Iowa debate featured on ABC. On August 20 Biden aired his first campaign advertisement in the first caucus state of Iowa. In the 30-second ad a voiceover states that Biden has a plan to end the Iraq War, and that [...] "We (America) must end this war in a way that doesn't require us to send their (soldiers) grandchild back." [...] It continues by declaring, [...] "Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of Iraq and keep us out." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] we got together with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever figure out how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E

2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

His sole desire was to merely [...] "scare the crap out of people". However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. This revelation caused them to change the series to focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters.

5000|$|Power {{appeared}} on BBC's HARDtalk on March 6, stating that Barack Obama's pledge to [...] "have all <b>U.S.</b> combat brigades <b>out</b> of Iraq within 16 months" [...] was a [...] "best case scenario" [...] that [...] "he will revisit when he becomes president." [...] Challenged by the host {{as to whether}} this contradicted Obama's campaign commitment, she responded, [...] "You can’t make a commitment in March 2008 about what circumstances will be like in January 2009.... He will, of course, not rely on some plan that he’s crafted {{as a presidential candidate}} or a U.S. Senator. He will rely upon a plan — an operational plan — that he pulls together in consultation with people who are on the ground to whom he doesn’t have daily access now, as a result of not being the president." [...] She concluded by saying that [...] "what we can take seriously is that he will try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces <b>out</b> of Iraq as quickly and responsibly as possible." [...] In February 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. would end combat operations in Iraq by August 31, 2010 and withdraw all U.S. soldiers by the end of 2011. The U.S. formally ended its mission in Iraq on December 15 of that year.|$|R
40|$|At {{the heart}} of the "American" psyche is an engrained urge to roam. From the {{original}} colonial settlers to manifest destiny and from highways to the moon landing, the great American future has always existed somewhere just beyond the horizon. As the 21 st century closes its first tenth, the proliferation of semi-autonomous and autonomous machines -funded by the Department of Defense via the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -indicates the potential for larger structures to move semi-autonomously in the near future. (That is architectural typologies will emerge as semi-autonomous, mobile entities. As there is an estimated U. S. population of 3 million people who live primarily in mobile recreational vehicles, it is not absurd to imagine a transition from houses on wheels to houses on legs.) Because architecture currently faces the overwhelming burdens of energy reliance, infrastructural sprawl, and cultural differences it is perhaps time to introduce a radical solution and postulate to its theoretical limits in order to catalyze impetus for meaningful change. If only there were a gizmo <b>to</b> help <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of here [...] . It is the uniquely American obsession with technology, which Reyner Banham details in The Great Gizmo, that has fueled the most critical transitions through history and it is technology that informs the premise of this thesis. According to the DARPA website, "throughout history technical challenges have inspired generations". Through a combination of research, creative work, reality, and philosophical projection Where the Sidewalk Ends provides insight and possible solutions for a tumultuous era. This thesis contains a creative composition and selection of coursework from ARCH 402 with Michael Silver as well as additional narrative and reflection. Narrative, images, processes, and end products are combined into a book to capture the topic and selected activities from ARCH 402 for the benefit of future Ball State students.

40|$|Non-adherence to {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{treatment is}} a major challenge to global TB control because it {{increases the risk of}} treatment failure, relapse and the emergence of drug-resistant TB. Although the problem is widely acknowledged, there is still no clarity about the exact impact of different levels and patterns of non-adherence on treatment outcome. This hampers the provision of adequate advice to patients and clinicians, and it challenges the development and evaluation of adherence-promoting interventions. In this article, we explain why we are still in the dark with respect to predicting how different types of non-adherence to TB treatment affect treatment outcome. We show that we lack uniformity in how we define and measure non-adherence, that we have no easily accessible treatment success indicators, and that the relationship between treatment adherence and outcome is influenced by a number of pathogenic, immunological and pharmacological factors that are only partly understood. We conclude that an integral 'bench and bedside approach' that incorporates experimental studies with in vitro models and animals, as well as observational studies in patients with TB, is needed <b>to</b> help <b>us</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the dark regarding the adherence-response relationship in TB treatment...|$|R

They just raised their machine guns and started firing across us, at our legs <b>to</b> stop <b>us</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out.</b> They were strafing, not aiming.

5000|$|However, another historian, Dwight Mears, {{profiled}} {{the fate}} of American airmen in Switzerland in his dissertation while teaching at West Point, and reached a starkly different conclusion. Mears documented that Legge was, in reality, running the escape network <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>U.S.</b> airmen <b>out</b> of Switzerland, and in no way condoned the imprisonment of these men for attempting escape. Rather than appeasing the Swiss, Legge was actually {{under investigation by the}} Swiss government for assisting the Americans to flee from internment. In fact, the Swiss Federal Council considered issuing a formal demarche against his activities, which they communicated to Legge directly. Legge did not bow to this pressure, but rather appealed directly to senior Swiss officials in order to secure better treatment for the airmen. He even threatened to leak word of their actions to the press to embarrass them, as he knew very well that allegations that the Swiss government was violating international law would taint the Swiss reputation for upholding humanitarian norms. The threat was made good on in 1945, when the Army's publication [...] Yank: The Army Weekly profiled the actions of the Swiss government, ostensibly drawing from U.S. Legation files that virtually quoted Legge's description of punishment camp conditions. Mears concluded that the negative impressions of Legge were forged by the lack of communication between the Legation and the internees, which was a direct consequence of Swiss interference after internment officials discovered that Legation visits to interned airmen quickly resulted in successful escapes. As a consequence, such visits were prohibited, and internees had little personal contact with the attaché or his staff. The airmen were almost entirely cut off from reliable information, and often jumped to conclusions that were based solely on rumors or assumptions. In fact, after making good on their escapes, a number of airmen protested to the War Department about perceived negligence by the Legation staff. In late 1944, the War Department officially investigated whether Legge had threatened to court martial airmen for unauthorized escape attempts, but it was clear that there was no formal evidence that such a threat had ever been issued. Rather, this was likely a misunderstanding of Legge's instruction not to escape without assistance from the Legation, which was an unsuccessful attempt to improve their chances of success.|$|R
