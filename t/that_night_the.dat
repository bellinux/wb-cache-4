5|$|After a short break, the {{division}} was allocated to a {{sector of the}} Margarethe Line, a series of fixed defensive works south of Lake Balaton which held up the Soviet advance. After several Red Army assaults were repulsed, static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945. In early March 1945, a few units took part in Operation Frühlingserwachen (Spring Awakening), {{which was to be}} Germany's last major offensive. Meanwhile, from December 1944 to March 1945, the rest of {{the division}} remained at Barcs rebuilding. In February, they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion, which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia. On 16 March, the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive, bypassing the Barcs area. <b>That</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at Heresznye, where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately.

The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files.

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E

Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} on 5 June at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité in Montmartre, more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who {{included}} Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played Patrie, and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from Carmen. At the burial which followed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet {{had been struck}} down {{just as he was}} becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his final peroration. After a special performance of Carmen at the Opéra-Comique <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.|$|E
