40|$|Abstract: Polyurethane {{plaster cast}} {{was an open}} weave fabric bandage, {{prepared}} by coating polyurethane prepolymer on raschel knitted fiberglass and polyester fabric. Curing takes place by coming in contact with water to form hard rigid cast. Polyurethane prepolymers were synthesized by reacting molar excess of diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) with polypropylene glycol (PPG) at 60 °C for 2 hours. This effect of different NCO/OH molar ratio and molecular weight of polyol on the <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time, setting time, diametral compression strength, percent elongation and tensile strength of polyurethane plaster cast were investigated [...] It was observed that with increase in NCO/OH molar ratio, <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time and setting time of the cast decreases, whereas diametral compression strength increases. Tensile strength was determined in universal testing machine and was found to increase with increasing NCO/OH ratio while opposite trend was observed in case of percent elongation. With increase in polyol molecular weight, <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time and setting time of the cast increases, whereas diametral compression strength decreases. Blended polyols i. e. PPG 1000 with PPG 400 in 50 / 50 ratio gives tensile strength and diametral compression strength in between their unblended counterparts. In comparison to fiberglass cast, polyester cast has higher percent elongation and diametral compression strength. Key words: Polyurethane plaster cast Prepolymer Fiberglass cast Polyester cas...|$|E
40|$|Polyurethane foam (PUF) {{panels are}} {{fabricated}} for the Mark I 1 radome using {{the raw materials}} Polyol and methylene di-isocyanate (MDI). Recently, a trial panel fabricated before actual large-scale production of panels contained blow holes. It was noticed that the gel time as measured for the raw materials used for the panel fabrication was higher than the practically required value. Hence important parameters like temperature and ratio of polyol and MDI were varied and tests were conducted to determine cream time, gel time and <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time. The solutions suggested, when incorporated during panel fabrication, resulted in desired quality of radome panels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFlexible PU foam was {{synthesized}} {{by using}} recycled PU foam polyol (Infrigreen) which contain 4 functionality obtained from glycolysis wasted PU foam, as a polyol. PU foam is prepared by incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wt% in petrochemical polyol (CARADOL. SA 34 - 05) which contain 2 functionality. Triethlylenediamine (TEGOAMIN 33) {{was used as}} the gelling catalyst. Polyether modified polysiloxane (TPGAOSTAB B 8715 LF 2) was the surfactant. Distilled water was used as a blowing agent to generate foam. Polymeric methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) which contain 2. 7 isocyanate groups/molecule was used for generate urethane linkage and carbon dioxide. The parameters investigated are characteristic time, i. e. cream time, gel time, rise time and <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time, cell structure and cell morphology, tensile properties, compressive properties and compression set were compared with petrochemical based PU foam. It was found from the research that, cream time, gel time, rise time and <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time, decrease with the recycled PU foam polyol content. It was also found that the incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol led to the increase in smaller cell size and large distribution of cell size. Tensile properties and compressive properties of PU foam increase with polyol functionality, including crosslink density and urea formation in PU foam. Decreasing of shape recover properties of PU foam obtained at high recycled PU foam polyol contents. This was caused by the deformation of hydrogen bonding between hard segments of PU chains. These results indicate that tensile properties and compressive properties of PU foam enhance by incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol...|$|E

40|$|There {{is perhaps}} no public policy {{issue on which}} economists {{are more likely to}} agree than on the {{desirability}} of free trade. [Yngve Ramstad, 1987, p. 6] Proponents of {{what has come to be}} called globalization promote free trade as one important part of the solution to poverty, economic volatility, and inequality. The major institutional players on this side of the debate—the IMF, World Bank and World Trade Organization—all emphasize the role played by a free trade regime in addressing these issues. Opponents of globalization take the opposite <b>tack,</b> arguing that <b>free</b> trade and financial integration have exacerbated poverty, inequality and market volatility. In Seattle, Quebec City, and in various venues throughout the world, anti-globalizatio ists have taken their criticism into the streets with a vigorous display of anti-corporate, anti...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{recently}} developed silyl radical chemistry {{is used in}} combination with transition metal carbonyls MC (dimanganese(0) decacarbonyl; dirhenium decacarbonyl; cyclopentadienyl iron(II) dicarbonyl dimer) for both free radical promoted cationic photopolymerization (FRPCP) and free radical photopolymerization (FRP). The newly developed photoinitiating systems (MC/silane and MC/silane/iodonium salt) are highly efficient under air. Photopolymerization profiles obtained upon a visible light irradiation delivered by a xenon lamp show that high conversion can be easily achieved after a 400 s exposure.

40|$|International audienceThe {{abilities}} of two naphthalimide derivatives with a methacryloyl group to initiate, when incorporated in multi-component systems, a ring-opening polymerization of epoxides and a radical polymerization of acrylates under different irradiation sources (e. g. very soft halogen lamp irradiation, laser diode at 457 nm, laser diode at 405 nm and blue LED bulb at 462 nm) have been investigated. One {{of them is}} particularly efficient for the cationic and radical photopolymerization of an epoxide/acrylate blend in a one-step hybrid cure and leads {{to the formation of}} an interpenetrated polymer network IPN (30 s for getting <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> coatings). The migration stability of one of these naphthalimide derivatives is found to be excellent in the cured polyacrylates and IPNs. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, electron spin resonance spin trapping and laser flash photolysis techniques...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNewly {{developed}} benzophenone derivatives {{in combination}} with an iodonium salt (and optionally Nvinylcarbazole) or amines {{have been used as}} photoinitiating systems. Their abilities to initiate cationic photopolymerization of epoxides and/or radical photopolymerization of acrylates under very soft visible halogen lamp, LED and laser diodes irradiations have been investigated. One of them (BPD 5) is particularly efficient for the cationic and radical photopolymerization of an epoxide/acrylate blend in a one-step hybrid cure and leads to the formation of an interpenetrated polymer network IPN upon the house hold blue LED bulb exposure (1 min for getting <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> coatings). The performances attained with some derivatives are better than those obtained with camphorquinone, used as reference photoinitiator, highlighting their high initiating abilities. These systems can be useful to overcome the oxygen inhibition for very low light intensity. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by molecular orbital calculations, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and steady state photolysis techniques...|$|E
30|$|The Braive and BK drying {{recorder}} is {{an instrument}} frequently {{employed in the}} coatings industry to measure the drying performance of a paint film operated with different lengths of a test strip; hence the two names used to denote it. This recorder consists of hemispherically ended needles, moving {{along the length of}} the test strip, which is made from plain glass and coated with a thin film. The drying characteristics of paint film are classified into four stages: the paint flows together (wet-edge time), the paint begins to polymerise (dust-free time), surface dries and finally lines become no longer visible on the film (total drying or through drying time) (Miccichè et al. 2005 a). However, Klaasen et al. classified the drying performance into three phases: open time (a scratch line traced by a pin closes up), dust free time (pin leaves a visible scratchy line, partially closed) and <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time (a scratch line does not close) (Klaasen & van der Leeuw 2006). Clearly, assessing the drying of film suffers from subjective evaluation.|$|E
40|$|Ternary {{composites}} of rigid {{polyurethane foam}} (RPUF) /glass fiber/silica {{as well as}} RPUF/glass fiber have been fabricated from glass fiber, silica, polymeric 4, 4 ′-di-phenylmethane diisocyanate (PMDI) and polyol using HFC 365 mfc as blowing agent.

With the addition an increasing amount of glass fiber cream time, rise time, gel time, <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time, density, compression strength, thermal conductivity (k) monotonically increased while the glass transition temperature showed a maximum at 2 %. At constant glass fiber content (2 %), addition of silica further increased the process times, density and compression strength while the Tg and thermal decomposition temperature showed a maximum at 3 % silica. The k value of RFUF/glass fiber composite decreased with the addition of silica up to 3 %, where it was even lower than the virgin RPUF. However, beyond the content k value increased. Overall, the variation of k value with silica content showed identical tendency with cells size and closed cells content...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenerally, the {{flexible}} polyurethane foams were synthesized by mainly petroleum-based polyols. In this present study, Caradol SA 34 - 05 (petroleum-based polyol) {{was replaced by}} Emerox® 14001 (natural oil-based polyol) with 0 - 50 wt% replacement to prepare flexible polyurethane foam by one shot method. The NCO index (NCO equivalent/OH equivalent) was fixed at 1. 00. The characteristic times such as cream time, gel time, rise time and <b>tack</b> <b>free</b> time were followed during cup test. The physical properties were characterized and studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and foam density. The tensile and compression properties were investigated by UTM machine. The {{results show that the}} foam density decreased with increasing Emerox® 14001 contents up to 20 wt% replacement and then decreased. This trandency was similar to tensile modulus, compressive modulus and compressive strength results. The cell size of foams was important parameter to control their properties. However, tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by the addition of Emerox® 14001 at 20 wt% contents replacement and then decreased at higher content. Both parameters rely on balance between urethane linkages and urea microdomain and/or polyurea ball contents(urea aggregate), which were rapidly generated by isocyanate group and water. The increased Emerox® 14001 contents required more isocyanate. As a result, more urea microdomain were produced leading to the decreasing of tensile strength and elongation at break. Moreover, the compression set of the foams was dependent upon amount of urea linkages which was generated from the reaction of isocyanate group and water...|$|E
