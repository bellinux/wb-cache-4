25|$|Dink was prosecuted {{three times}} for denigrating Turkishness under Article 301 of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code.</b> He was acquitted the first time, convicted and {{received}} a suspended 6-month jail sentence the second time, which he had appealed at the European Court of Human Rights.

50|$|The tender was annulled, Çakıcı and Yiğit were arrested. The {{coalition}} cabinet led by Yılmaz {{fell down}} by a {{motion of no confidence}} on January 11, 1999. A parliamentary investigative report, which accused Yılmaz and Güneş for conspiring to rig bids on tender, became obsolote due to nearing general election in 1999. After the general election in 2002, a new parliamentary investigation committee confirmed the accusations against the both politicians, and proposed to send them to the Constitutional Court of Turkey (Yüce Divan) for trial. The supreme court concluded on June 23, 2006 that Yılmaz and Taner are guilty of bid rigging as per <b>Turkish</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code's</b> Article 765 Section 205. However, the sentences were reprieved in accordance with applicable laws.|$|R

25|$|Article 301 is {{an article}} of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code</b> making it illegal to insult Turkey, the Turkish nation, or Turkish {{government}} institutions.

25|$|In February 2006 {{the trial}} opened against five journalists charged with {{insulting}} the judicial {{institutions of the}} State under Article 301, and also of aiming to prejudice a court case under Article 288 of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code.</b> Each of the five had criticized {{a court order to}} shut down a conference in Istanbul about the Ottoman Armenian casualties in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. (The conference was nevertheless eventually held after having been transferred from a state university to a private university.) The charges carried a potential penalty of a prison term of up to 10 years. The court dropped the charges against four of them on April 11, 2006 when it was determined that the time allowed by the statute of limitation had been exceeded, while Murat Belge, the fifth, was acquitted on June 8, 2006.|$|E

50|$|The {{issue of}} {{conscientious}} objection {{is a highly}} debated and controversial issue in Turkey. Turkey and Azerbaijan {{are the only two}} members of the Council of Europe that still refuse to recognize conscientious objection. Although Article 24.1 of the 1982 Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of conscience, it does not extend to the right to conscientious objection to military service. In 1991, the Turkish Constitutional Court explicitly ruled that the freedom of conscience mentioned in Article 24 does not include the right to conscientious objection to military service. Article 63 of the <b>Turkish</b> Military <b>Penal</b> <b>Code</b> punishes conscientious objectors for avoiding military service. Furthermore, Article 318 allows these individuals to be punished up to 2 years if they attract media attention or publish articles about their refusal to perform military service.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, the Article 301 of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>code</b> {{made it a}} {{crime to}} insult Turkishness (...) , but under {{pressure}} of the EU, this was changed in 2008 to protect the [...] "Turkish nation" [...] instead of Turkish ethnicity in 2008, an 'imagined' nationhood of people living within the National Pact (...) borders.|$|E

2500|$|Voicing {{opinions}} {{against the}} draft {{is considered a}} social stigma in Turkey, and certain provisions in the <b>Turkish</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code,</b> such as Article 301, are often used to prosecute those who voice such opinions.
