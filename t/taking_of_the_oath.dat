In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, Rush Holt, {{was elected to the}} Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath.

25|$|Historians, {{constitutional}} {{scholars and}} biographers all dismiss the claim. They {{point out that}} Atchison's Senate term had ended on March 4 as well, and he also was not sworn in for another term, or re-elected President pro tempore, until March 5. Furthermore, the Constitution doesn't require the President-elect to take {{the oath of office}} to hold the office, just to execute the powers. As Atchison never swore the oath either, that did not make him Acting President. Most historians and scholars assert that as soon as the outgoing President's term expires, the President-elect automatically assumes the office. Some claim instead that the office is vacant until the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|E

2500|$|While the {{swearing}} of {{some sort}} of oath goes back to the earliest records of organised masonry, the first recorded ritual is not until 1696, in the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. From this, and from other documents of the same period, such as the Trinity College, Dublin manuscript of 1711, we can form an idea of the ritual of an operative lodge {{at the end of the}} 17th century. On <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of an Entered Apprentice a mason was entrusted with appropriate signs, a [...] "Mason's Word", and a catechism. This was accompanied by much horseplay, which was probably excised as the craft became more gentrified. The fellowcraft was made to take a further oath, and entrusted with two further words and the [...] "five points of fellowship", which in 1696 were foot to foot, knee to knee, heart to heart, hand to hand, and ear to ear. The distinction between a fellowcraft and a master is unclear, and in many documents they appear to be synonymous. As accepted masons became initiated, where the various words and signs could no longer be regarded as professional qualifications, the entered apprentice ritual and the fellowcraft/master were sometimes condensed into one ceremony.|$|E

Our will is, not that you strive to enrich Us by vexation of Our subjects; but rather that you aim steadily as well towards the advantage of the Country as Our particular interest, forasmuch as We make no difference between these two objects," [...] but consider them one and the same. This is written, and gets into print within the month; and his Majesty, that same day (Wednesday, 2d June), when it came to personal reception, and actual <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oath,</b> was pleased to add in words, which also were printed shortly, this comfortable corollary: [...] "My will henceforth is, If it ever chance that my particular interest and the general good of my Countries should seem to go against each other,--in that case, my will is, That the latter always be preferred."
