5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone,</b> however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} {{to question the}} townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} {{what has happened to the}} town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E
5|$|The Jaradan demand their {{greeting}} {{earlier than}} the agreed time and are insulted at having to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> other than the Captain. The crew try to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but find it impossible; the Jaradan signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) attempt to repair the holodeck systems, while inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech (Harvey Jason) appears having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover the holodeck is malfunctioning and {{they are unable to}} exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.|$|E
25|$|After the airing, Murphy became uncharacteristically despondent and {{completely}} stopped all investigation {{on the case}} and refused to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> about it again, and never gave clear reasons why. In February 1969, Murphy was struck and killed by an unidentified car in an apparent hit-and-run while crossing a road. The hit-and-run occurred near Ventura, California, while Murphy was on vacation.|$|E

50|$|This game {{involves}} raising, fighting, {{and breeding}} monsters. The main character is never seen on screen and never <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> directly.

500|$|Chung {{speaks to}} a science fiction and Dungeons & Dragons fanatic, Blaine, who {{frequently}} roams the woods of Klass County at night looking for UFOs. As Blaine tells Chung, one night he found an alien body that was subsequently recovered by Mulder, Scully and Detective Manners. Blaine thinks that Mulder and Scully {{are a couple of}} men in black. He claims that Mulder was emotionless, but shrieked when he saw the alien, and that Scully, whom Blaine believed was a man dressed like a woman, threatened him and told him not to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> about the alien body. Mulder allows Blaine to videotape Scully performing an autopsy on the alien, which is quickly released as a video [...] "documentary" [...] labeled [...] "Dead Alien! Truth or Humbug?" [...] that is narrated by the Stupendous Yappi (from [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"). The autopsy reveals that the alien is actually a dead Air Force pilot in an alien costume.

500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E
60|$|By {{some chance}} they missed Dick Lomas and Mrs. Crowley. Neither was sorry. When {{they left the}} cathedral and started for home, they spoke for a while of {{indifferent}} things. It seemed that Alec's tongue was loosened, and he was glad of it. Lucy knew instinctively {{that he had never}} <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> as he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, and she was curiously flattered.|$|R
5000|$|The frontrunner was {{a former}} foreign minister, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was {{supported}} by much {{of the military and}} establishment.

2500|$|Prior to {{and during}} each start, Halladay had a {{distinct}} trademark {{in which he}} went into a complete [...] "isolation mode", immersing himself in complete concentration and in more or less his own words: To plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a [...] "hello" [...] or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or had completed the game.|$|E
2500|$|On August 25, 2005 Garbage {{cancelled}} their scheduled October tour {{dates in}} France, Belgium and United Kingdom.

Ahead of the Australian tour, [...] "Sex Is Not The Enemy" [...] was released to Australian radio. The end of the tour {{marked the end of}} active promotion for Bleed Like Me. The band confirmed that they were going [...] "on indefinite hiatus" [...] to dispel reports of a split. [...] "We were barely even speaking," [...] Manson later admitted. [...] "We didn't want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> outside of the band about the problems we were having with our career, so of course it turned into this whole passive-aggressive thing between us.

2500|$|With {{the sudden}} {{death of his}} grandfather, a grief-stricken Healy shut himself away, refusing to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> Emerging a week later, and with a clear vision of where he now wanted Travis and their music to go, Healy {{dispensed}} with the band's management and publicity agent. Having been repeatedly knocked back by the British record industry, the band couldn't afford to stay around the country for another few years and so decided to move to New York, feeling that the U.S. might be more suited to their style of music. However, before leaving Healy told the band that they should send the demo to Charlie Pinder of Sony Music Publishing, who they had known for a few years and regularly sent songs to, saying: [...] "If he's not into it, then we'll go." [...] Pinder was immediately impressed by the song [...] "All I Want to Do is Rock", which he felt was a dramatic change for the band: [...] "It was harder, more exciting, sexy; all things that they never really were. They turned a corner." [...] After performing a secret gig for Pinder and his boss at Sony, Blair McDonald, they were signed to Sony Music Publishing. The immediate impact of what was a very secret deal was that the line-up was changed—keyboard player Geoff Martyn was removed, and the bassist, Geoff's brother Chris, was replaced with Healy's best friend Dougie Payne—and the band was moved to London, where they were given a rehearsal room and a house.|$|E
