5|$|The Jagiellonian dynasty was not {{entitled}} to automatic hereditary succession, rather each new king had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> nobility consensus. Władysław Jagiełło had two sons late in life from his last wife Sophia of Halshany. In 1430, the nobility agreed to the succession of the future Władysław III only after the king consented {{to a series of}} concessions. In 1434, the old monarch died and his minor son Władysław was crowned; the Royal Council led by Bishop Oleśnicki undertook the regency duties.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan District {{accepted}} that {{wages and salaries}} had to be high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers. It generally allowed wages and salaries to be paid by contractors as they saw fit, subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit inflation. Salaries above $9,000 had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Patterson and Groves.|$|E

5|$|The Secretary of State regulates flag {{protocol}} {{as well as}} {{the distribution}} and sale of the state flag. Replica flags made for commercial sale are required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Secretary of State. The state seal on the flag must be stitched on both sides with the profile of George Washington facing the same direction, making the Washington state flag among the most expensive U.S. state flags to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} games (where the Cup {{could change}} leagues) {{are to be}} decided either in a one-game affair, a two-game total goals affair, or a best of three series, {{to the benefit of}} both teams involved. All matches would take place on the home ice of the champions, although specific dates and times would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the trustees.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and {{would be the first}} of a long series of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E

5|$|While Motts Clamato {{continues}} to be synonymous with the cocktail, other producers have begun offering alternative caesar mixes. Walter Caesar (named in honor of Chell) was launched in 2013 to offer an 'all natural' alternative to Clamato. Walter Caesar also became the first caesar mix in Canada <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Ocean Wise by using ocean-friendly clam juice from the North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Without any {{ostensible}} heir, Cosimo contemplated {{restoring the}} Republic of Florence. However, this presented many obstacles. Florence was nominally an Imperial fief, and Siena a Spanish one. The plan was about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the powers convened at Geertruidenberg when Cosimo abruptly added that if {{himself and his}} two sons predeaceased the Electress Palatine she should succeed and the republic be re-instituted following her death. The proposal sank, and was ultimately put on hold following the Emperor Joseph's death.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the nobles and knights of both lands. The {{meeting between the}} nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 {{in the town of}} Nakło, where they {{confirmed}} the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> {{artists such as}} Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster and Evans became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. Toward {{the end of his}} apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to work late into the night and return early in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Following Walt Disney's passing, Wolfgang Reitherman {{continued}} as both producer {{and director of}} the features. The studio began the 1970s with the release of The Aristocats, the last film project <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Walt Disney. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms {{for the rest of the}} decade. The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features. Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes.|$|E

5|$|In January 1893, Palmer {{approached}} the House Appropriations Committee, asking that $10,000 {{of the funds}} already designated to be paid over to the Lady Managers {{by the federal government}} be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E
5|$|Laos was {{a neutral}} country {{according}} to the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on 23July1962. Therefore, the United States was prohibited from openly conducting military operations in the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. Ambassador to Laos William H. Sullivan. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed it as he thought that Laotian Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma would not allow his country {{to be involved in}} an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. However, Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by U.S. military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Membership in B'nai Israel was {{restricted}} to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined. The members also instituted rules intended to guard {{the image of the}} small Jewish congregation {{in the eyes of the}} much larger Christian community. New members had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> a secret ballot, and existing members could blackball candidates. A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.|$|E
50|$|Although {{plans for}} a {{military}} academy were proposed as early as 1818, it would be only in 1822 when such plans materialized, with the efforts of Diego Garcia Conde, the ex-Spanish military officer then serving in the Mexican Army, for such an academy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formed <b>were</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Mexican Imperial Government, through the Imperial War Ministry.|$|R

50|$|A {{referendum}} on additional {{representation in the}} House of Representatives for Maryland County was held in Liberia on 7 May 1861. The proposal {{to increase the number}} of representatives from one <b>to</b> three <b>was</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the requisite two-thirds majority, and was passed.|$|R
5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
5|$|The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was {{organised}} {{under the}} control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts and many emigrated. Books and scripts had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.|$|E
