40|$|Catastrophic {{incidents}} {{have the}} potential to provoke government action. In the words of former Chief of Staff for President Barack Obama, Rahm Emmanuel, “[y]ou never want a serious crisis to go to waste. ” In the case of two major past environmental disasters, Congress did not let the opportunity for new environmental legislation to pass unrealized. In 1980, following the 1979 Love Canal incident, the United States Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Similarly, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) following the 1989 Exxon Valdez environmental disaster. In 2010, British Petroleum’s Deepwater Horizon exploded and released 4. 9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This event {{was one of the most}} catastrophic environmental events in U. S. history and yet, Congress has failed to pass sweeping environmental reform. Not only have the enormous environmental and economic impacts caused by the release put the OPA to the test, but the OPA has proven insufficient. Although Congress designed the OPA with <b>tanker</b> <b>spills</b> in mind, this Comment finds that, even for <b>tanker</b> <b>spills,</b> the OPA is flawed. Further, this Comment will suggest ways to improve the OPA and argues that Congress should act by increasing financial and criminal liability in order to prevent future spills. Part II of this Comment provides a brief history of water pollution in the United States and continues to discuss the Exxon Valdez disaster, the OPA, and the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Part III argues that the OPA is inefficient because it only sufficiently focuses on medium sized <b>tanker</b> <b>spills,</b> leaving large spills at the mercy of the benevolence of the polluter while doing little to deter minor spills. Part IV discusses different ways to address the OPA’s inefficiencies and Part V concludes that Congress can reduce the occurrence of environmental disasters by extending liability to lenders, shareholders, and employees through the use of criminal liability...|$|R
50|$|An {{outsider}} {{visits a}} remote isolated village that has seemingly shunned the modern life. Doctor Del Shaw, an investigator from the British ecological watchdog group nicknamed Doomwatch, {{is sent to}} the island of Balfe, to file a report on the effects of a recent oil <b>tanker</b> <b>spill.</b> He becomes fascinated with the mysterious behavioural disorders of the locals who display rudeness and random aggression and a strange genetic prevalence of thick lips and sloping brows. Investigation shows that the villagers have been suffering over a prolonged period from hormonal disorders, which are being caused by leaking drums of growth stimulants that have been dumped offshore. The islanders have been eating contaminated fish and develop a disorder of excessive hormonal growth, which produces aggression and eventually madness, attributed to a form of acromegaly. Rather than seek help from the mainland they hide those who are deformed from any newcomers.|$|E

5|$|Oil tankers {{are only}} one source of oil spills. According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery spills. Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills but more than 60% of the volume. <b>Tanker</b> <b>spills</b> are much more rare and much more serious than spills from non-tank vessels.|$|R
40|$|The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) {{was largely}} {{driven by the}} catastrophic EXXON VALDEZ <b>tanker</b> <b>spill</b> and several other major tanker spills that {{followed}} in 1989. Under the OPA 90 mandate, the U. S.

Declining trends in the volume of oil spilled into U. S. waters indicates that these initiatives are {{at least in some}} measure successful. The Coast Guard is now concerned about what the future may hold in terms of oil pollution threats, and prevention, preparedness and response program shortcomings and opportunities in the future. To address this issue, the Coast Guard, in partnership with other National Response Team agencies and industry, is conducting a Broad-Based Programmatic Risk Assessment to develop a comprehensive vision and strategy for the Oil Spill Prevention, Preparedness and Response (OSPPR) Program in the 21 st Century. This study will characterize the current and emerging oil spill threats by source category, assess the potential impacts of these threats to define overall risk, and examine the current and projected effectiveness of OSPP...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{downstream}} planning in the Prince William Sound/Gulf of Alaska region is clear. As demonstrated during the Exxon Valdez oil spill, a major {{oil spill in}} Prince William Sound {{has the potential to}} impact coastlines and communities in “downstream communities ” in the Cook Inlet and Kodiak regions, or subareas. Yet, the oil spill planning system that has evolved in the State of Alaska does not sufficiently plan for an oil spill that originates in one Subarea of the state but impacts other subareas in the downstream spill path. Prince William Sound Regional Citizens ’ Advisory Council (PWSRCAC) has raised the issue of downstream response planning during past public review cycles for the Prince William Sound Tanker Plan. However, major gaps still exist in the public and industry plans that define how an oil spill response would proceed in the event that a Prince William Sound <b>tanker</b> <b>spill</b> once again spread beyond the geographic bounds of the Sound.

40|$|Nowadays, {{criminal}} liability over vessel-source pollution is a debatable issue worldwide. For example, after Erika and Prestige oil <b>tanker</b> <b>spill</b> disasters, the EU adopted Directive 2005 / 35 /EC, which imposes {{criminal liability}} over vessel-source pollution. This raised the Intertanko Case in the European Court of Justice. The shipping industry tried {{to challenge the}} legality of Directive 2005 / 35 /EC under international law. China is now a great shipping power {{as well as the}} second largest seafarers supplier in the world. Meanwhile, vast sea areas under China’s jurisdiction are under threat of vessel-source pollution. This presentation addresses criminal liability over vessel-source pollution in China. Relevant international law is first described. Then the presentation focuses on Chinese legal regime. There is an article of environmental crime in the Criminal Law of China. The Marine Environmental Protection Law also provides a link to impose Criminal Law on marine pollution. However, until now, there is no report about criminal liability over vessel-source pollution in any Chinese court. The presentation intends to answer: why there is a gap between law in the book and law in practice? Should China follow other countries such as the EU to impose criminal liability over vessel-source pollution? If so, how to improve the regime...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the determinants of}} the size of oil <b>tanker</b> <b>spills.</b> In the lit- erature, spill size has been estimated but the results are not very strong. A review of the existing results is provided and the determinants of spill size using a sample selection model are estimated. Estimates from a Tobit regressions are also given to serve as a basis of comparison with the earlier work. One important nding is that groundings and collisions result in larger spills if there is a spill, but the likelihood {{that there will be a}} spill due to a grounding or collision is very low. Tanker size is found to have only a marginal e ect on the probability of a spill and a dubious e ect on spill size. US ag tankers and new tankers are found to have a lower probability of causing spills compared to foreign ag and old tankers, respectively. US ag tankers do not have smaller spills when type of cargo variables are included in the analysis.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the patterns of}} nucleotide sequence variation at three mitochondrial DNA loci, the noncoding mitochondrial control region and two genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I) of Gavia immer in the largest collection of wintering individuals from Southern Europe to date. The sample consisted of 33 birds, oiled during the 2002 / 2003 Prestige <b>tanker</b> <b>spill</b> and washed ashore on the Galician coast (NW Iberian Peninsula). The aims {{of the study were}} to investigate the levels of standing genetic variation in the species, and to identify the geographic origin of these wintering birds. To do this, all available sequences of these loci, mostly from North American specimens collected from both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, were retrieved from GenBank and included in the analysis. Overall, only 14 genetic variants were detected in the nearly 2 Kb surveyed, which reflects very low levels of nucleotide site diversity in this species. Interestingly, all variants were found at very low frequencies, and there was no indication of any clear subdivision in the G. immer population. This genetic profile is consistent with G. immer being a single panmictic population of small effective population size as compared with other seabirds. These circumstances preclude identification of the breeding regions of these wintering birds relying solely on genetic data. In the light of these results, possible causes, and the genetic and ecological consequences, of this demographic scenario are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is carried out}} to improve Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) in oil tanker operations in general, to extend and enhance in specific Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM), {{with the aim of}} reducing human error and thus subsequently preventing oil <b>tanker</b> <b>spills.</b> It is concentrated on oil tanker operations to address the limitation of availability of human reliability data in the maritime domain. The continual occurrence of oil <b>tanker</b> <b>spills,</b> which was substantiated with analysis of historical data of oil tanker incidents/accidents from 1970 to 2008, provides a judicious reason to conduct this research. The critical review of Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) and HRA results {{in the development of a}} conceptual framework of HRA facilitating FSA and incorporating Human Organisational Factors (HOF), which addresses the shortcomings of the generic HRA and FSA methodologies that exist independently in the management of oil tankers to prevent oil spills. The CREAM is reviewed due to its prominent use in identifying the root causes of human error. However, its inability of providing solutions to an incident/accident investigation and robust quantification of human reliability features stimulates the development of an advanced CREAM and a human reliability quantification model using a combined Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) and fuzzy logic approach in this research. In addition to facilitating identification of the root causes of human error, the advanced CREAM also provides the solutions to a quantification model, which enables the development of HRA data in the maritime domain. Furthermore, lack of CREAM studies on relationships among Common Performance Conditions (CPCs) is addressed by proposing a Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model, which allows for a comprehensive understanding of relationships and interdependencies among the CPCs. The model could also be used toappreciate and assimilate the relationships and interdependencies among human factor variables involved in other transportation systems and industrial fields. Finally, the {{research is}} concluded with an integrated AHP and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model for determining the selection of an appropriate risk control option (RCO) while performing an incident/accident investigation by taking subjective judgments of decision makers into consideration. This research as a pioneer work in developing and applying advanced techniques to improve the generic CREAM in oil tanker operations establishes a foundation for future effort to improve the use of CREAM in other industries. The techniques developed can also be tailored to investigate and deal with an incident/accident effectively, resulting in the reduction of human error within the system management of any organisatio...|$|R
