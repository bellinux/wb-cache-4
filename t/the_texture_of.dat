5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the eggs.|$|E

5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E

5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the wood after carving softened {{the tone of the}} drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E

25|$|Sonic texture {{relates to}} the number of sound sources and the {{interaction}} between them. The word 'texture', in this context, {{relates to the}} cognitive separation of auditory objects. In music, texture {{is often referred to as}} the difference between unison, polyphony and homophony, but it can also relate (for example) to a busy cafe; a sound which might be referred to as 'cacophony'. However texture refers to more than this. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> an orchestral piece is very different to <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> a brass quintet because of the different numbers of players. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> a market place is very different to a school hall because of the differences in the various sound sources.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGenerally, <b>the</b> surface <b>textures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport fabrics {{influence}} the aerodynamic {{properties of the}} athletes in motion. On the other hand, <b>the</b> surface <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> sports garments largely depends on the applied stress while wearing. Therefore, the fitting of garments on athlete bodies can make the aerodynamic behaviour more complex. Additionally, the fabric at an appropriate level of stretching can provide an aerodynamic advantage. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to measure the aerodynamic properties of three commercially available sport fabrics using a standard cylinder methodology over a range of Reynolds numbers and stretch conditions alone with microscopic analysis. The results indicated that <b>the</b> surface <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabric was changed under different stretched levels and these changes in <b>the</b> surface <b>texture</b> had a notable effect on the aerodynamic drag. <b>The</b> surface <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> fabrics caused transitional effect at lower speeds compared to the smooth bare cylinder providing almost 30 % drag reduction...|$|R
40|$|Surface <b>texturing</b> <b>of</b> silicon using {{femtosecond}} (fs) laser irradiation is {{an attractive}} method for enhancing light trapping, but the laser-induced damage that occurs in parallel with surface texturing can inhibit device performance. In this work, we investigate the light-material interaction during <b>the</b> <b>texturing</b> <b>of</b> silicon by directly correlating the formation of pressure-induced silicon polymorphs, fs-laser irradiation conditions, and the resulting morphology and microstructure using scanning electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We show that raster scanning a pulsed laser beam with a Gaussian profile enhances the formation of crystalline pressure-induced silicon polymorphs by {{an order of magnitude}} compared with stationary pulsed fs-laser irradiation. Based on these observations, we identify resolidification-induced stresses as the mechanism responsible for driving sub-surface phase transformations during <b>the</b> surface <b>texturing</b> <b>of</b> silicon, <b>the</b> understanding of which is an important first step towards reducing laser-induced damage during <b>the</b> <b>texturing</b> <b>of</b> silicon with fs-laser irradiation.
