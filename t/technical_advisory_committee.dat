40|$|Communication {{in central}} banking {{has become a}} very serious matter. Not long ago central banking was {{shrouded}} in mystery: decision making was seldom transparent and communication with financial markets minimal. Now central banks influence the economy as much through management of expectations as through policy actions. The need for increased central bank communication has been influenced {{by a number of}} developments. As central banks have become more independent, transparency and accountability of their actions has become more important. Further, with the weight of traditional banking declining in the financial sector, monetary policy transmission takes place more through impersonal financial markets which requires greater communication. The task of central banks has become more complex as the objective of financial stability is added to those of inflation targeting and economic growth. The more complex the mandate of central banks becomes the more important the role of communication. The Reserve Bank of India has such a complex mandate requiring clear communication with financial markets and the public. It does this through policy announcements, reports, regulatory communications, <b>technical</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>committees,</b> and interactions with the media. Transparency i...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe California Health Interview Survey, {{the largest}} state health survey in the United States, uses {{community-based}} participatory research principles to develop each cycle. Other large-scale health surveys rarely include participatory research approaches. Every 2 years, the California Health Interview Survey generates {{state and local}} population-based data on health insurance coverage, access to health care, chronic disease prevalence and management, health behaviors and disease prevention, and other health issues in California. The survey is used for policy and program development, advocacy, and research. MethodsThe development of the California Health Interview Survey involves more than 145 people from more than 60 state and local policymaking bodies, public health agencies, advocacy groups, research organizations, and health care organizations. They participate as volunteers in an <b>advisory</b> board, on <b>technical</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>committees,</b> and in work groups that interact with California Health Interview Survey research staff in an accountable advisory process that shapes survey topics, measures, and sample design and determines languages selected for translation.

ResultsCalifornia Health Interview Survey data {{have been widely used}} by local, state, and national public health leaders, policymakers, advocates, and researchers to improve access to health insurance and health care services and to develop and target prevention programs for obesity and chronic illnesses.
