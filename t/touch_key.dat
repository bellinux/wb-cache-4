40|$|Mobile phones with a {{touch screen}} {{replacing}} traditional keypads have been introduced to the market. Few studies, however, have been conducted on the touch interface design for a mobile phone. This study investigated the effects of <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes and locations on the one-handed thumb input that is popular in mobile phone interactions. Three different <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes (i. e. square shape with 4 mm, 7 mm, and 10 mm wide) and twenty five locations were examined in an experiment. The results provided two groups of <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> locations (an appropriate and an inappropriate region) with respect to three usability measures including success rate, number of errors, and pressing convenience. In addition, a hits distributions based algorithm was applied to target selection tasks, which statistically improved the performance. The {{results of this study}} could be used to design touch keys so as to enhance the usability of mobile phones {{with a touch}} screen...|$|E

40|$|People tend to {{use their}} {{smartphones}} one-handed, which is unergonomic for the human musculoskeletal system. Stretching the thumb to reach certain touch keys is uncomfortable. Especially now that smartphones have large screens, normally ranging from 4. 5 ” and above. Exaggerated use of smartphones can lead to repetitive strain injury (RSI), which is caused by static, repetitive movements over an extended time. This master thesis investigates how different <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> locations and <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes affect the ergonomics of user interfaces on large smartphones. Moreover, it examines if {{the principles of the}} functional area improve the ergonomics of mobile user interfaces. The functional area is the surface of the touchscreen that is reachable by the thumb. Expert interviews were used to collect data to make hypotheses regarding improving the ergonomics of mobile user interfaces for one-handed interaction. An electromyography (EMG) test was conducted to investigate the hypotheses. EMG is a technology used to measure muscle contractions. The results show a significant correlation between a user interface that applies the functional area and a decline in muscle contraction. However, the decline in muscle contraction only occurs if the functional area is designed specifically for the user’s dominant hand. There {{were no significant differences between}} the <b>touch</b> <b>key</b> sizes and the extent of muscle contraction. The findings from this master thesis support the idea that the functional area and changes in the user interface design affect the ergonomics of smartphone interaction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A fractal journey. Towards a {{symbolic}} phenomenology of the atomistic revolt. We propose {{the construction of}} a particular narration of atomism since its beginning with Democritus (460 BC. - 370 BC.) until this day. Not intending to be thoroughgoing with such a wide history but aiming nevertheless to be rigorous, we open a path through the long life of this cosmological drive running in every field of science and philosophy by using a method that we call "symbolic phenomenology", in reference to our principles and themes, our limits and possibilities, to the gestures of our analyzes. The four Elements, the numbers, the u-topia, the earth and the expeausition (Skin-Show, Nancy, 2000) are consequently developed as symbols to gradually fill the notion of an atom whose meaning in the usual language has been deprived of its past and of the discontinuity that we identify as its source. By this intuitions we go forward and we discover what it could mean to have an atomistic approach to the world and which the last sprouts of this approach are: Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Luc Nancy. Both philosophers being in a constellation that indicates us a direction, a new philosophical possibility: The phenomenology of <b>touch.</b> <b>Key</b> words: atomism, symbolic phenomenology, fractality, phenomenology of touch, expeausition...|$|E
