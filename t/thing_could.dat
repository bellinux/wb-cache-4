5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> happen to anyone.|$|E
25|$|The French Revolution of 1789 {{probably}} {{added to}} the strain that Charlotte felt. Queen Charlotte and Queen Marie Antoinette of France and Navarre kept a close relationship. Charlotte was 11 years older than Marie Antoinette, yet they shared many interests, such as their love of music and the arts, in which they both enthusiastically took an interest. Never meeting face to face, they kept their friendship to pen and paper. Marie Antoinette confided in Charlotte upon {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution. Charlotte had organized apartments to be prepared and ready for the refugee royal family of France to occupy. After the execution of Marie Antoinette and the bloody events that followed, Charlotte was said to have been shocked and overwhelmed that such a <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> happen to a kingdom, and at Britain's doorstep.|$|E

This no doubt occurred. Both guns were at once reloaded, and the rammer's indicator, working by machinery, set fast and failed to show how far the new charge had gone." ...|$|E

500|$|The fair {{organizers}} did not await {{congressional approval}} to begin planning the coin. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B.

On December7, 1922, Commission of Fine Arts chairman Charles Moore wrote to Buffalo nickel designer and sculptor member of the commission James Earle Fraser, [...] "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. [...] They {{are going to have a}} 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal...

500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E

500|$|Despite Weed's efforts, Taylor was {{nominated}} {{on the fourth}} ballot, to the anger of Clay's supporters and of [...] Conscience Whigs from the Northeast. When order was restored, John A. Collier, a New Yorker and a Weed opponent, addressed the convention. Delegates hung on his every word as he {{described himself as a}} Clay partisan; he had voted for Clay on each ballot. He eloquently described the grief of the Clay supporters, frustrated again in their battle to make Clay president. [...] Collier warned of a fatal breach in the party, and stated that only one <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> prevent it: the nomination of Fillmore for vice president, whom he incorrectly depicted as a strong Clay supporter. Fillmore in fact agreed with many of Clay's positions, but did not back him for president and was not in Philadelphia. Delegates did not know this was false, or at least greatly exaggerated, and there was a large reaction in Fillmore's favor. At the time, the presidential candidate did not automatically pick his running mate, and despite the efforts of Taylor's managers to get the nomination for their choice, Abbott Lawrence of Massachusetts, Fillmore became the Whig nominee for vice president on the second ballot.|$|E
500|$|Schlattmann {{thought to}} write the comic book store {{homicide}} storyline when {{he picked up the}} Aquaman snow globe in his office and thought, [...] "'Wow, this <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> easily be a murder weapon," [...] because of its weight and its edge. The writers wanted to use the actual Aquaman globe but DC Comics would not allow the character and the snow globe {{to be used in the}} episode, so the Dexter art department custom-made a snow globe. The superhero's name ultimately became [...] "Mariner" [...] as other names including [...] "Sea King" [...] and [...] "King of the Seas" [...] could not be used for legal reasons. Trademark and copyright clearances was again an issue when finding a name for the superhero based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. [...] "The Eradicator" [...] and [...] "Judge Justice" [...] were considered, but the final choice was [...] "The Dark Defender". Cerone said that the name was [...] "a little on the generic side, but it was one we could clear." [...] He said that The Dark Defender was in part an homage to [...] and [...] to Dexter's Dark Passenger, featured in Jeff Lindsay's series of Dexter novels on which the television series is based. On the poster, The Dark Defender, though hooded, was drawn with a smile to resemble Michael C. Hall. The poster was rendered by comic artist Tone Rodriguez, with whom Schlattmann had previously worked on a screenplay in development at 20th Century Fox. When Schlattmann visited Rodriguez's studio in Los Angeles to discuss the art, comic book writer Dan Wickline was also there. Schlattmann thought that [...] "by including the two of them, we could make things a bit more special and add some credibility to the show". Wickline played the dead comic book shopkeeper, while Rodriguez played the prime suspect for the murder. The Dark Defender character also lent its name to a series of highly stylized Dexter webisodes, recapping Dexter's victims of the second season.|$|E

2500|$|Poe argues the Soviet Union did not {{collapse}} {{because of}} the failure of Communism as many pundits assert. Rather, he contends that the Communist Party lost faith in the traditional path that had not only preserved Russian independence for almost five centuries, but had also enabled the country to build a huge empire. That path included a reliance on autocratic leadership, a command economy, tight controls on debate in the public sphere and a state-engineered military. [...] "Using these means," [...] Poe writes, [...] "the Russian elite was able to take a primitive, premodern state and transform it in the course of two centuries {{into one of the most}} powerful enterprises on earth. It is difficult to see how such a <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> be seen as a failure." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "eternal recurrence", {{the idea that}} with {{infinite}} time and {{a finite number of}} events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. As Heidegger points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of The Gay Science (cited below), presents this concept as a hypothetical question rather than postulating it as a fact. [...] According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the question of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: [...] "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [...] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' {{is at the same time}} 'the most burdensome thought.'

2500|$|The U.S. never {{adopted the}} {{floating}} charge directly {{because at the}} time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of unencumbered assets to look to; and even if such a <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> exist, it was a fraudulent conveyance. [...] However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property. [...] As it had become clear that creditors and debtors were going to find ways to create enforceable de facto security interests in after-acquired property and general intangibles whether courts liked it or not, the UCC drafters in the 1940s (particularly Grant Gilmore) successfully argued that such interests should be legitimized and simplified in the form of the floating lien.|$|E

Now I do not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time and saw what happened. His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that I found in it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true."
