500|$|Lauren London as New New/Erin Garnett, Rashad's love {{interest}} and John Garnett's daughter. The character of New-New was {{loosely based on}} R group TLC's [...] "T-Boz as a kid," [...] said London. [...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, {{a lot of people}} say that I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, to the fact that she's new. And there's just so much truth in her, and she doesn't know how to lie yet as an actress. It was perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweetums" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{called it}} a [...] "fantastic episode", and called the world of Parks and Recreation rich, lively and [...] "a beautiful mosaic". Fowler praised individual comedic moments, like the DJ Roomba jokes and portrayal of the easily [...] fooled Pawnee citizens, {{as well as the}} development of storylines like that of Tom and Wendy, and Andy and April. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the episode for revealing more about the mythology of the town of Pawnee, such as the strong influence Sweetums holds over the residents, and the ongoing feud between the parks department and the library. He also praised the character development of characters like Tom and April, adding, [...] "It's amazing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> in such a short time, Parks & Rec has taken the most one-note characters and made them truly three-dimensional." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{repelling}} a division-sized counterattack on October 8, {{and establishing}} bridgeheads {{on the east}} bank {{to a depth of}} around 15 kilometers, the Egyptians had accomplished the objectives of Operation Badr. At the start of the war, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger believed that the better-equipped Israelis would secure victory within a few days, and thus tried to delay a ceasefire in the United Nations Security Council. The counterattack on October 8 however, came against American expectations. Kissinger was taken aback when told of the extent of Israel's losses on the morning of October 9 by Israeli Ambassador Simcha Dinitz, and asked [...] "Explain <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> could 400 tanks be lost to the Egyptians?" [...] Dinitz may have threatened Kissinger with the use of nuclear weapons against Egypt and Syria in order to underline the urgency of Israel's situation and push the U.S. into initiating an airlift to replace Israel's losses. Later that day Kissinger relayed U.S. President Richard Nixon's decision to initiate Operation Nickel Grass—which aimed to replace all of Israel's material losses—to Dinitz.|$|E

500|$|The {{prosecution}} set out {{its case}} at the pre-trial committal hearing, which began in Minehead on 20 November 1978. At the request of Deakin's counsel, reporting restrictions were lifted, which meant that newspapers were free to print anything said in court without fear of the libel laws. This move infuriated Thorpe, who had hoped for an in camera hearing which would avoid unfortunate newspaper headlines and perhaps lead to the dismissal of the case. Whatever the outcome, Thorpe knew that the adverse publicity would destroy his career, and that Scott would thus have his revenge. As the hearings began, Bessell described the 1969 meetings where he alleged that Thorpe had suggested that Holmes should kill Scott, including the comment about the shooting of a sick dog. The court learned that Bessell had a contract with [...] The Sunday Telegraph, which was paying him £50,000 for his story. Dinshaw gave evidence of the £20,000 he had received from Hayward and passed to Holmes, and of subsequent attempts by Thorpe to obscure the details of these transactions. Newton testified that Holmes had wanted Scott killed: [...] "He would prefer it if [...] vanished {{from the face of}} the earth and was never seen again. It was left <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to do it". Scott gave clinical details of his alleged seduction by Thorpe at Thorpe's mother's house in November 1961 and on other occasions, and also recounted his ordeal on the moors above Porlock Hill. At the end of the hearing the presiding magistrate committed the four defendants for trial at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, current Middlesex {{district}} attorney Gerry Leone {{stated that the}} murder would be solved, but law enforcement needed witnesses who had remained silent to come forward. The Cremin family erects a billboard each year since her death, to offer a reward {{for information about the}} killer. At the bottom of the billboard, a quote reads: [...] "You know what you did <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> much longer must I wait! Please help make my time in heaven restful." [...] The reward has grown from $10,000 in 1995 to $20,000 by 2005, to $50,000 in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Letters {{can also}} be potent {{conveyors}} of homoerotic feelings; the letters between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, two well-known members of the Bloomsbury Group, are full of homoerotic overtones characterized by this excerpt from Vita's letter to Virginia: [...] "I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia [...] It is incredible <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> essential you have become [...] I shan't make you love me any the more by giving myself away like this --But oh my dear, I can't be clever and stand-offish with you: I love you too much for that." [...] (January 21, 1926) ...|$|E

Folks are everlasting begging for money here, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>How's</b> your project of painting the hall coming on?" ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{seems to}} me that we are {{concerned}} in this case not with [...] "the complexity of the tax laws," [...] ante, at 200, but with the income tax law in its most elementary and basic aspect: Is a wage earner a taxpayer and are wages income? [...] t is incomprehensible <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>how,</b> in this day, more than 70 years after the institution of our present federal income tax system with the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, any taxpayer of competent mentality can assert as his defense to charges of statutory willfulness the proposition that the wage he receives for his labor is not income, irrespective of a cult that says otherwise and advises the gullible to resist income tax collections. One might note in passing that this particular taxpayer, after all, was a licensed pilot for one of our major commercial airlines; he presumably was a person of at least minimum intellectual competence.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing other {{specific}} {{songs on}} the album, Skiba mentioned that the title track uses heroin and methadone addiction {{as a metaphor for}} love, stating that [...] "It's a human condition that I think we all, in one way or another, fall victim to. It's not to say that people can't be happy or find bliss in a relationship. It's just amazing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> unhappy most people are and they can't shake it and can't fix it, much like an addiction." [...] He also discussed the politically themed [...] "The American Scream", a song inspired by the suicide of a United States Army soldier after his return from the War in Afghanistan: [...] "For a long time we were afraid to write overtly political songs but I read this article about a US soldier that came back from a tour of duty in Afghanistan and blew his head off on his mother's grave and I wrote a song about that." [...] He has described the lyrical style of This Addiction as [...] "thinking-man's punk": [...] "We wanted to do something that's fun but also interesting and lyrically, something that will be fun for people to read along to and hopefully understand." ...|$|E
