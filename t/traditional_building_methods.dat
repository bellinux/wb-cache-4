25|$|Francis Petre's work {{cannot be}} judged against {{that of the}} great {{classical}} architects of the northern hemisphere, who so clearly influenced him. He did not create a style or have a revival period named after him. His achievement was adapting and developing so many established styles well; whether through the new techniques of steel or concrete, or through more <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> <b>methods.</b> He was given amazing opportunities to prove himself worthy as an accomplished and inspired architect; the many monumental buildings with which he provided New Zealand are testimony to his talent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Waters's neoclassical style building, Japanese carpenters developed a pseudo-Japanese style known as giyōfū chiefly using wood. A {{good example of}} which is Kaichi Primary School in Nagano Prefecture built in 1876. The master carpenter Tateishi Kiyoshige travelled to Tōkyō to see which Western building styles were popular and incorporated these in the school with <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> <b>methods.</b> Constructed with a similar method to traditional (...) storehouses, the wooden building plastered inside and out incorporates an octagonal Chinese tower and has stone-like quoins to the corners. Traditional namako plasterwork was used {{at the base of}} the walls to give the impression that the building sits on a stone base. Another example was the First National Bank building in Tokyo, built in 1872.|$|E

50|$|A {{building}} technique mostly associated with Lincolnshire, England, {{and parts of}} Scotland gets part of {{its name from the}} studs: mud and stud (stud and mud). This <b>building</b> <b>method</b> uses studs in a framework which is then totally covered with mud which resembles the building material cob. Another <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> <b>method</b> is called stud and plaster where the plaster walls are held by lath on the studs.

50|$|The <b>method</b> of <b>building</b> wooden <b>buildings</b> with a <b>traditional</b> {{timber frame}} with {{horizontal}} plank or log infill has many names, {{the most common}} of which are piece sur piece (French. Also used to describe log building), corner post construction, post-and-plank, standerbohlenbau (German) and skiftesverk (Swedish). This <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> <b>method</b> {{is believed to be the}} predecessor to half-timber construction widely known by its German name fachwerkbau which has wall infill of wattle and daub, brick, or stone. This carpentry was used from parts of Scandinavia to Switzerland to western Russia. Though relatively rare now, two types are found in a number of regions in North America, more common are the walls with planks or timbers which slide in a groove in the posts and less common is a type where horizontal logs are tenoned into individual mortises in the posts. This method is not the same as the plank-frame buildings in North America with vertical plank walls.|$|R

The building belongs to Saadi sect, and the constructor was Shejh Emin. His profession was also professional layer (called [...] "kadi") educated at the Ottoman Empire centres. The inheritor of the tekke is now Shejh Ruzhdi. A characteristic of the tekke is that during its building it was applied the <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> <b>method.</b> The foundation and the ground floor were built by the carved stone, while the first floor was built by bricks, the roof is a wooden construction with extended eaves and there are decorations on the walls and on the ceiling. On its floor it {{is situated}} the zone of [...] "samahane" [...] which is the praying quarter while the cupola is wood carved. Architecture concept of the object belongs to the citizen folk architecture and presents a complex of buildings with tekkes, tyrbes (small mausoleums), samahane (ritual prayer hall), fountains, houses and other following buildings. Interior and exterior are rich in carved woodwork. This building is explicit for its guestroom on the second floor shaped in octagon form. It's very interesting monument architecture wise, because it presents a rare sample of sacral architecture that will serve for studying, as tourism attraction, but also as a religious building encumbered with many tangible and spiritual heritage values.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> {{simulation}} <b>methods</b> can be a slow process, which often fails to integrate into the decision making process of non-technical designers, such as architects, at the early design stages. Furthermore, studies have shown that predicted energy consumption of buildings during design is often lower than monitored energy consumption during operation. In view of this, this paper outlines research to create a user friendly design tool that predicts energy consumption in real-time as early design and briefing parameters are altered interactively. As a test case, the research focuses on school design in England. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained to predict the energy consumption of school designs by linking actual heating and electrical energy consumption data from the existing building stock to a range of design and briefing parameters...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a bounding volume hierarchy {{based on the}} Slab Cut Ball. This novel type of enclosing shape provides an attractive balance between tightness of fit, cost of overlap testing, and memory requirement. The hierarchy construction algorithm includes a new method {{for the construction of}} tight bounding volumes in worst case O(n) time, which means our tree data structure is constructed in O(n log n) time using <b>traditional</b> top-down <b>building</b> <b>methods.</b> A fast overlap test method between two slab cut balls is also proposed, requiring as few as 28 - 99 arithmetic operations, including the transformation cost. Practical collision detection experiments confirm that our tree data structure is amenable for high performance collision queries. In all the tested benchmarks, our bounding volume hierarchy consistently gives performance improvements over the sphere tree, and it is also faster than the OBB tree in five out of six scenes. In particular, our method is asymptotically faster than the sphere tree, and it also outperforms the OBB tree, in close proximity situations...|$|R

50|$|The Roman period {{brought the}} {{construction}} of the first large-scale buildings in Britain, but very little survives above ground besides fortifications. These include sections of Hadrian's Wall, Chester city walls and coastal forts such as those at Portchester, Pevensey and Burgh Castle, which have survived through incorporation into later castles. Other structures still standing include a lighthouse at Dover Castle, now part of a church. In most cases, only foundations, floors and the bases of walls attest to the structure of former buildings. Some of these were on a grand scale, such as the palace at Fishbourne and the baths at Bath. The more substantial buildings of the Roman period adhered closely to the style of Roman structures elsewhere, although <b>traditional</b> Iron Age <b>building</b> <b>methods</b> remained in general use for humbler dwellings, especially in rural areas.|$|R

40|$|The {{elevation}} {{information is}} not considered in the <b>traditional</b> <b>building</b> change detection <b>methods.</b> This paper presents an algorithm of combining LiDAR data and ortho image for 3 D building change detection. The advantages of the proposed approach lie in the fusion of the height and spectral information by thematic segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed method also combines the advantages of pixel-level and object-level change detection by image differencing and object analysis. Firstly, two periods of LiDAR data are filtered and interpolated to generate their corresponding DSMs. Secondly, a binary image of the changed areas is generated by means of differencing and filtering the two DSMs, and then thematic layer is generated and projected onto the DSMs and DOMs. Thirdly, geometric and spectral features of the changed area are calculated, which is followed by decision tree classification {{for the purpose of}} extracting the changed building areas. Finally, the statistics of the elevation and area change information as well as the change type of the changed buildings are done for building change analysis. Experimental results show that the completeness and correctness of building change detection are close to 81. 8...|$|R

The key idea of 3 D building damage detection is the 3 D Change Detection using 3 D point cloud obtained from aerial images through Structure from motion (SFM) techniques. The approach of building damage detection discussed in this paper not only uses the height changes of 3 D feature of scene but also utilizes the image's shape and texture feature. Therefore, this method fully combines the 2 D and 3 D information {{of the real world}} to detect the building damage. The results, tested through field study, demonstrate that this method is feasible and effective in building damage detection. It has also shown that the proposed method is easily applicable and suited well for rapid damage assessment after natural disasters...|$|R
