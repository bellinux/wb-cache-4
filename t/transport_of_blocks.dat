40|$|Given {{that the}} lower third of a pyramid {{contains}} about 70 % of the stone blocks, the only efficient way of reducing building time at the minimum is a method which allows for upward transport of material from all four sides simultaneously. Ramps positioned tangentially with a slope of 26 ° come to mind. The time required for upward <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> significantly influences the total building time. By comparison, the production of blocks in the quarry {{as well as their}} transport to the building site and horizontal transfer on the respective level would have been far less challenging as more workforce would have been available. In the model presented here, upward pulling of blocks on horizontal rollers is accom- plished by letting workers move downwards {{on the other side of}} the ramp. After completion of the stepped core, the ramps are removed, and the casing, which consists of horizontal courses, is laid. For this, a stepped auxiliary platform and tangential ramps are used. Thus, it is possible to set the pyramidion and subsequently polish the exterior face top down without significant danger, while also removing the auxiliary platform...|$|E

The unphosphorylated form of EIIAGlc binds to the lac permease and prevents it from bringing lactose into the cell.

The Hybrid ARQ procedure is modeled as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP), where the transmission cost {{is defined in}} terms of the signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) which is based on the desired (quality-of-service) QoS parameters <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> <b>block</b> error rate (BLER) for enhancing spectrum utilization subject to QoS constraint. The Q-learning reinforcement algorithm is employed to accurately estimate the transmission cost to perform the most suitable decision of modulation and coding scheme for the packet initial transmission while the requirement <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> <b>block</b> error rate is guaranteed. Simulation results show that the QoS requirement <b>of</b> <b>block</b> error rate for Q-HARQ is nearly met around a reasonable value indeed. In addition, the system throughput of the Q-HARQ can be improved under the specific QoS constraint of BLER. It is verified finally that the Q-HARQ scheme is feasible in the practical system because of the short processing and convergence time. I...|$|R

In this work, we use seismic facies analyses, measurements <b>of</b> preserved <b>blocks,</b> and correlations between MTDs thickness and salt diapir geometry to introduce a new method to estimate the provenance of MTDs on 3 D seismic data. Our method, applied to a high-quality 3 D seismic volume from the Espírito Santo Basin (SE Brazil), provides information on the location of source areas of MTDs, their bulk composition, and on their directions <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> Whenever <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> strata are found, their orthogonal axes are measured to estimate parameters such as Maximum Projection Sphericity Index (MPSI), Oblate Prolate Index (OPI), and ratio of short and intermediate axes (ds/di). These parameters are used to quantify the relative degrees <b>of</b> remobilization and <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> MTDs. Statistical data of importance include the variation of MTDs thickness with the diameter and distance from the centre of growing salt diapirs. In addition, the presence of cubic or equant blocks with c/a> 0. 4 and c/b> 0. 65 ratios are typical of proximal areas in MTDs, reflecting small transporting distances. Our work {{is important because it}} shows that distinct correlation coefficients exist between the thickness of MTDs and diameter of salt diapirs. Positive coefficients of correlation between diapir diameter and MTD thickness characterise active diapirism during the deposition of MTDs. This quantification allows the interpreters to distinguish MTDs sourced from local diapirs from MTDs sourced from more distal regions on the continental slope. Thus, the new method used in this research provides an alternative technique to kinematic indicators for determining the provenance <b>of</b> mass <b>transport</b> deposits on continental margins...|$|R

Results Ionizing radiation resulted in src kinase stabilization, activation and subsequent src mediated caveolin- 1 Y 14 - and EGFR Y 845 -phosphorylations. Both phosphorylations were radiation specific {{and could not be}} observed after treatment with EGF. Inhibition of EGFR by the antibody Erbitux resulted in a strong accumulation of caveolin/EGFR complexes within the cytoplasm, which could not be further increased by irradiation. Radiation-induced caveolin- 1 - and EGFR-phosphorylations were associated with nuclear EGFR <b>transport</b> and activation <b>of</b> DNA-PK, as detected by phosphorylation at T 2609. Blockage of src activity by the specific inhibitor PP 2, decreased nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> EGFR and inhibited caveolin- 1 - and DNA-PK-phosphorylation. Knockdown of src by specific siRNA blocked EGFR phosphorylation at Y 845, phosphorylation of caveolin- 1 at Y 14 and abolished EGFR transport into the nucleus and phosphorylation of DNA-PK. Consequently, both knockdown of src by specific siRNA and also inhibition of src activity by PP 2 resulted in an enhanced residual DNA-damage as quantified 24 h after irradiation and increased radiosensitivity. Conclusion Src kinase activation following irradiation triggered caveolin- 1 dependent EGFR internalization into caveolae. Subsequently EGFR shuttled into the nucleus. As a consequence, inhibition of internalization and nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> EGFR <b>blocked</b> radiation-induced phosphorylation <b>of</b> DNA-PK and hampered repair of radiation-induced double strand breaks. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fields of {{dislodged}} {{boulders and}} blocks record catastrophic coastal flooding during strong storms or tsunamis {{and play a}} pivotal role in coastal hazard assessment. Along the rocky carbonate coast of Eastern Samar (Philippines) we documented longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> 180 t and boulders (up to 23. 5 t) shifted upslope to elevations of up to 10 m above mean lower low water level during Supertyphoon Haiyan on 8 November 2013. Initiation-of-motion approaches indicate that boulder dislocation occurred with flow velocities of 8. 9 – 9. 6 m s − 1, which significantly exceeds depth-averaged flow velocities of a local coupled hydrodynamic and wave model (Delft 3 D) of the typhoon with a maximum − 1. These results, in combination with recently published phase-resolving wave models, support the hypothesis that infragravity waves induced by the typhoon were responsible for the remarkable flooding pattern in Eastern Samar, which are not resolved in phase-averaged storm surge models. Our findings show that tsunamis and hydrodynamic conditions induced by tropical cyclones may shift boulders of similar size and, therefore, demand a careful re-evaluation <b>of</b> storm-related <b>transport</b> where it, based on the boulder's sheer size, has previously been ascribed to tsunamis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe HIV {{envelope}} glycoprotein gp 160 {{plays a major}} role in the posttranslational down-regulation of its receptor, CD 4. In this report we have analyzed the requirements of both CD 4 and gp 160 involved in <b>transport</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> the gp 160 –CD 4 complex causing the down-regulation of cell surface CD 4. Using a transient expression system we observed that both soluble and membrane-bound CD 4 were equally blocked by the wild-type gp 160, indicating that neither the transmembrane domain nor the cytoplasmic tail of CD 4 affected its interaction with gp 160 or exocytic <b>transport</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> the complex. Similarly, deletions of the gp 160 cytoplasmic domain or mutation in the transmembrane domain had little effect on its transport, or its ability to down-regulate CD 4 surface expression. Furthermore, substitution of the gp 160 transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail with that of the influenza virus hemagglutinin or with a glycophosphatidylinositol moiety did not affect its ability to bind CD 4 and block its transport. However, soluble {{envelope glycoprotein}} constructs (either gp 120 or soluble gp 160) were unable to block CD 4 transport to the cell surface despite their binding to CD 4 within the ER. Taken together these results demonstrate that neither the gp 160 cytoplasmic tail nor the specific sequences of the transmembrane region of gp 160 nor the membrane anchoring of CD 4 were involved in ER retention of the CD 4 –gp 160 complex and that anchoring of gp 160 to the ER membrane was responsible for gp 160 -mediated cell surface down-regulation of CD 4...|$|R

This study examines different concentrations of Mn for enhanced MR tract tracing. The premise <b>of</b> activity-dependent axonal <b>transport</b> was also examined by partial or complete blockade of retinal ganglion cell activity. Quantitative T(1) maps and semi-quantitative normalised signal intensities in the superior colliculi facilitated assessment of applied intraocular concentrations and activity dependence, respectively. Varying the concentration of applied Mn revealed a non-monotonic profile, with optimal, unfavourable and undesirable effects noted: 25 mM proved optimal, showing a maximal decrease in T(1), whereas 400 mM was associated with no terminal-field enhancement. The estimated vitreal concentration for optimal <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> Mn (2 mM) is substantially lower than that used in previous studies of the mouse. Both the partial blockade of inputs to 50 % of retinal ganglion cells by a mGluR 6 glutamate agonist and the complete blockade of all retinal ganglion cell activity with tetrodotoxin failed to decrease the relative enhancement in the superior colliculus. The failure to prevent axonal <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> Mn by <b>blocking</b> activity (and therefore theoretically the intracellular influx) appeared to be paradoxical. The optimal vitreal concentration of Mn has previously been shown to facilitate massive intracellular uptake <b>of</b> Mn, competitively <b>blocking</b> calcium, and 1 mM Mn blocks neurotransmission pre-synaptically. These results suggest that, at concentrations required for optimal Mn-enhanced MRI tract tracing in the visual system of the mouse, the uptake and <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> Mn may be dominated by passive mechanisms, which may also block neurotransmission...|$|R

40|$|At exposed {{sites on}} the deep water coasts of the British Isles, cliff-top storm {{deposits}} (CTSDs) occur on cliffs {{at a variety of}} elevations above sea level and may occasionally reach up to 50 m above sea level. Time-series field mapping of CTSDs has demonstrated their formation over the historical period and their continued modification during major past storms. This paper seeks to clarify the morphogenetic context of CTSDs, model the wave conditions and forces encountered at the cliff-face and cliff-top platform and propose mechanisms to link wave processes to cliff-face quarrying and landwards cliff-top <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> quarried <b>blocks</b> to deposition zones {{at the rear of the}} cliff-top platform. We report on wave-tank experiments using scaled cliff and wave conditions from a cliff in the Shetland Islands to focus on three situations: incident waves lower than the cliff edge height; at the same height as the cliff edge height; and higher than the cliff edge height. The modelling suggests that steep waves of 10 m and above impacting on a 15 m high cliff will result in impact pressures sufficient to promote crack propagation, block detachment and lifting <b>of</b> large <b>blocks.</b> Large, but not necessarily steep, waves of the same height as the cliff edge produce sufficient impact pressures and water flow over the cliff edge and platform to entrain blocks, transport and deposit them on the cliff-top. Where cliff-top height is below wave crest elevation “green water” bore flow occurs, sufficient to force rotation or lifting <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> out <b>of</b> cliff-top and cliff-top platform ‘sockets’. High flow velocities rapidly accelerate and transport blocks inland until the flow attenuation results in deposition <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> at the limit of run-up. The model results provide a good explanatory framework to account for the quarrying of the upper part of the cliff-face and cliff-top platform under storm wave conditions and provide an insight into the exceptional velocities experienced over the cliff-top platform under bore flow conditions. The modelling results show that extreme storm waves are capable <b>of</b> quarrying, <b>transporting</b> and depositing large blocks at altitude and significant distances inland and so present serious questions about the use of such deposits as diagnostic of palaeo-tsunami...|$|R

30|$|As {{the mode}} {{switching}} between single stream and dual streams is {{done at the}} user side based on maximizing SE, one may argue that the chosen mode {{may not be the}} most energy efficient one. Interestingly, as the total power consumption is the same for the two mode according to the power model given by (4), the choice made at the user side can lead to the most energy efficient mode, which can be explained as follows. Comparing (11) with (19), we can know that the denominators of the expressions on the right side are the same, so the value of estimated EE is determined by the numerators. Thus if the sum <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> <b>block</b> size <b>of</b> the preferred MCS levels for dual stream mode is greater than that for single stream mode, dual stream mode is selected by the user, and vice versa. So the energy efficient criterion for mode selection between single stream and dual streams is the same as maximizing SE criterion.|$|R
