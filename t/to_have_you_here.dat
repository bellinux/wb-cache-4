6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} you are going, Mr. Gilmore," [...] she said, {{looking at me}} kindly. [...] "It is like the happy old times <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> Margharita," [...] she said. [...] "Do {{you know}} that your {{likeness}} to your mother--and her family--has startled me. It is wonderful." ...|$|E

60|$|DEARTH. Oh, you. He made {{no bones}} about it; said there was {{something}} about you that made him want uncommonly <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> down <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Hola, Jock!" [...] he cried. [...] "I didn't thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> and yet I {{might have}} known it, too, when I saw friend Jim." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{came to him}} and yielded {{herself to}} his embrace. [...] "My queenly, {{beautiful}} girl! It is sweet <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> in my arms; but I must say good-bye--good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} good idee <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> to post us on {{what happens}} while we're away. Keep your eyes peeled, an' if {{anything}} pertic'lar turns up come over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I think it is," [...] said Ethel. [...] "How nice {{it would be}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here!</b> I am so glad {{you are willing to}} give it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} this way, Mr. Morton?" [...] he said. [...] "Count de Cartienne is sorry <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> {{but we are}} busy--very busy, and he <b>had</b> no time <b>to</b> {{get back to the}} hotel. The {{carriage}} will wait to take you back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack, I forgot," [...] she wailed. [...] "It was so new, so strange, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> up <b>here.</b> It {{was like}} a kind of dream. And after--after you kissed me I--I found out--" ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH. That's about it. What a life! But I oughtn't <b>to</b> <b>have</b> brought <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> Best <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{the sheet}} over {{you when the}} moon is about; {{moonlight}} is bad for little daughters.|$|R
6000|$|She {{advanced}} with a courtesy, at {{the same}} time affectionately taking the thin white hand stretched out to her. [...] "I hope you are better, ma'am. It is something like old times <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The reason I {{mention it}} is this, {{that we should}} be so very glad if you could be here. We all love you so much, and I should so like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> on that day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> again," [...] replied Curtis. [...] "And {{now that you}} are here, we must get your {{belongings}} together and get away. We are to camp to-night at the Sandstone Spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... - [...] "I {{am sorry}} last night <b>to</b> <b>have</b> failed <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> [...] And now I have {{travelled}} all day; And it's long rowing {{back to the}} West-Hoe Pier, [...] So brief must be my stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll 'splain ever'thing {{as soon as}} we get to your rooms," [...] promised Dorothy. [...] "You're {{in great}} luck, Uncle Henry and Aunt Em; an' so am I! And oh! I'm so happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> got <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> at last!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He obeyed my orders," [...] Fenella replied. [...] "I {{meant it}} for a little {{surprise}} for you. I {{thought that it would}} be pleasant after your drive <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> call <b>here</b> and rest for a short time. You must present me to your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you must, my dear. It {{would only}} {{add to the}} pain and {{confusion}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> now. They may like to have you to-morrow. Remember, he is not here. Take her, Jock. Take care of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this is SO nice <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> We'll {{have some}} good parties--dances and everything. You'll have to join the Jolly Seventeen. We play bridge {{and we have a}} supper once a month. You play, of course?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{that will}} make such a difference. Let me see. That will only be three months. And <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> on Christmas Day! I would sooner have you then than on any other day in the year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} like it, for we mean <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> come <b>here</b> a great deal. I sit to papa very often, and get so tired; {{and you can}} talk to me, and then you can see me draw and model in clay, and then we'll go in the garden, and Nanna will show you how to make baskets, and then we'll play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Miss Walters, I don't think I ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> brought <b>you</b> out <b>here,</b> and I {{am quite}} sure I {{ought not to}} stay any longer. Do return. Your Aunt will be annoyed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not {{suffered}} {{too much}} from the cold, Lady Blakeney," [...] resumed Chauvelin politely; [...] "we ought not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> kept <b>you</b> waiting <b>here</b> for so long, but delay at departure is sometimes inevitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one else," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "would {{come to you}} because of Mr. Fentolin. He does not wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> They love him {{so much in the}} village that he had only to breathe the word. It was enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do my best," [...] he agreed. [...] "If {{it sounds}} like rubbish, you can still believe that I {{appreciate}} everything you've told me. You are pretty, and I am lucky <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> Now I'll try to make you believe that I think so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} so good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> again," [...] said Maud, cuddling Polly's cold hand, {{as she sat}} at her feet, when she was fairly {{established}} between Fanny and Mr. Shaw, while Tom leaned {{on the back of}} his mother's chair, and enjoyed the prospect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{food into}} your mouth, <b>you</b> know. One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>here.</b> <b>You</b> will soon learn. If you don't, you get thin and miserable, and suffer a great deal--pain, you know--and finally you die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} {{satisfied}} {{with you as}} you are," [...] she replied, [...] "and I call it a downright shame. I thought, anyhow, I was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> both <b>here</b> until some great war broke out, and <b>here</b> <b>you</b> are running away for your amusement. It is all very well for you to contend that you think it may do you good, {{but it is just}} for change and excitement that you want to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All in good time," [...] {{the porter}} said; [...] "don't you hurry yourself. As long as <b>you</b> can stay <b>here</b> you'll be heartily welcome. Just look what a comfort it is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> sitting <b>here</b> sociable and comfortable. You don't suppose I could have sat here {{alone in this}} room if <b>you</b> hadn't been <b>here?</b> I {{should have been in}} a public house making a beast of myself, and {{spending}} as much money as would keep the pair of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wasn't {{going to}} say that at all. What a pig you are sometimes, Nutty. As if I wasn't only too glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> What I was {{going to say}} was that you ought to be very thankful that you have got to draw water and hew wood--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then stay, Wulf, I {{shall be}} glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> I have but {{little time to}} myself now, {{but it is a}} relief to put aside grave matters sometimes. I will appoint a room for you near my own chamber. You have heard no news of her, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, Agnes, now {{you will}} get warm again. Do {{you know you are}} looking very well after your journey, and are {{certainly}} even prettier than when I saw you last. I begin to think I was very foolish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> at all: you will quite eclipse poor little me." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{acknowledgment}} {{of which is}} a fair occasion offered me, to retire from the consideration of your lordship to that of myself. I <b>here</b> present <b>you,</b> my lord, with that in print, which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the goodness not to dislike upon the stage; and account it happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you</b> <b>here</b> in England; it being, at best, like small wines, to be drunk out upon the place, and has not body enough to endure the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Thorne," [...] said he, pulling {{himself up}} at the gate, [...] "if I had known that I was to be so {{extremely}} happy as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> I would <b>have</b> brought <b>you</b> down the most beautiful creature, an Arab. She belongs to my friend Jenkins; but I wouldn't have stood at any price in getting her for you. By Jove! {{if you were on}} that mare, I'd back you, for style and appearance, against anything in Hyde Park." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Why call on your mother? She {{can be no}} mother <b>to</b> <b>have</b> left <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> If a bird is {{dropped out}} of the nest, it belongs to the man who picks it up. If a jewel is cast by the wayside, it is his who dare win it and wear it, as I will win you and will wear you. I know now why Pallas Athené sent me hither. She sent me to gain a prize worth all my toil and more.’ ...|$|R
