40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research {{is on the}} examination of notification systems that harness different presentation formats for notification delivery, the preferences that individuals express for these various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and how these preferences are affected by contextual information surrounding notification delivery. My research is unique from other work in the literature in two primary ways. First, {{while the majority of}} prior work addressing notification delivery, both in terms of format and timing, has focused on the effects of a notification on an individual’s performance on a given task or set of tasks, my focus is the individual’s perception of notifications, and particularly on that individual’s preferences for different notification formats delivered within different contextual scenarios. An interest in this question is motivated by prior studies that have shown that annoyance with computer-human interactions is a primary reason behind user abandonment of interactive software systems. Second, my preliminary findings suggest that different people prefer different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in different contexts, which motivates a change of focus in the development of such systems toward customizing notifications not only to the features of an individual’s context but also to the individual him- or herself. An additional element of novelty in my work is that my final study was conducted in a purely naturalistic office environment, in which the notifications evaluated were precisely those notifications being delivered to study participants throughout their workday. The primary contribution of this dissertation is twofold: a detailed analysis of the methodology for the design, data collection, and analysis of a study of notification preferences in a naturalistic setting {{with a great deal of}} inherent complexity; and a set of results, based on the analysis of preference data acquired in various settings, about how an individual’s contextual environment, and the content of a given notification, can affect that individual’s preferences for notification delivery...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Pervasive {{computing}} systems {{involve a}} number of different embedded, mobile and sensory devices. To provide their intended service or application, these devices will collect unprecedented levels of data about users as they go about their daily lives. Users are anticipated to seamlessly, and frequently, physically move between numerous monitoring systems on a regular basis. As a result, it may become difficult for users to comprehend and keep track of the systems that monitor them, how their data is used, and to give informed consent. One solution is to use smart phones to selectively notify users to changes in the monitoring systems around them. However, there is often a problem in identifying and designing for the opportune moment to send a notification.

In order to expedite the maturity in this area, a proper and supportive portal where all researchers could gather and cooperate in conducting their research need to be established. One of the features in a portal that can assist Bioinformatics researchers in performing their work is the ability of the portal to notify. Notification system is a combination of software and hardware to provide a method of distributing message(s) to a set <b>of</b> recipients. The <b>notification</b> messages could assist the recipients in many ways, from time saving and cost saving till life saving. Notification system can be developed with numerous functions depending on the needs and o ne of the most beneficial functions in research area is notification on the next most relevant knowledge to be read. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> could lessen the researchers’ time in finding the correct thus enhancing their research efficiency. Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> that could assist researchers is the events reminder.

40|$|Placed {{within the}} realms of Human Computer Interaction, this thesis {{contributes}} towards the goals of Ubiquitous Computing, where mobile devices can provide anywhere, anytime support to people’s everyday activities. With interconnected computing devices distributed in our habitat, services relevant to any situation may be always available to address our needs. However, despite the enhanced capabilities of mobile phones, users had been reluctant to adopt any services other than calls and messaging. This has been changing more recently, especially since {{the launch of the}} iPhone, with users getting access to hundreds of services. The original question motivating the research presented in this thesis “How can we improve mobile service usage?” {{is in the interest of}} enthusiasts of mobile services as well as slow adopters. We propose the concept of ‘mobile service awareness’ and operationalise it through the more focused research question: “How can we design for non-intrusive yet informative auditory mobile service notifications?” We design and conduct a series of surveys, laboratory experiments and longitudinal field studies to address this question. Our results, also informed by literature on context-aware computing, awareness, notification systems and auditory interface design, produce two distinct major contributions. First, we provide a set of conclusions on the relative efficiency of auditory icons and earcons as auditory notifications. Second, we produce a set of design guidelines for the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> based on the critical evaluation of the methodologies we develop and adapt from the literature. Although these contributions were made with mobile service notification in mind, they are arguably useful for designers of any auditory interfaces conveying complex concepts (such as mobile services) and are used in attention demanding contexts.

40|$|Operators {{working in}} complex data-rich environments, such as air traffic control, need {{to cope with}} considerable, often competing, attentional demands. They {{experience}} data overload in vision and audition, are required to timeshare tasks, and need to manage unexpected changes and events. Current technologies fail to support them in handling these challenges. This has led to breakdowns in performance and, in some cases, accidents. The goal of the present research is to develop novel informative <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> that minimize unnecessary attention switching and better assist operators in attention management. They inform operators {{about the presence of}} an interruption as well as its urgency and location, thereby helping operators avoid performance costs associated with attention switching. Based on the assertion that information can be better processed in parallel if distributed across modalities, these notifications employ and combine two under-utilized modalities: touch and peripheral vision. They are graded, i. e., their salience varies over time, to reflect changes in the importance of attending to an interruption. Gradation was implemented either intra- or crossmodally (i. e., within or across peripheral vision and touch). The proposed designs were expected to improve the detection of unexpected events and the decision making about attention switching without significantly affecting performance on ongoing primary tasks. A series of studies were conducted to a) identify effective tactile notification designs, b) compare the effectiveness of peripheral visual and tactile notifications, and c) evaluate 5 notification schemes that employ peripheral vision and touch as well as gradation. The findings from this research show significantly improved interruption management and overall task performance for all cued over uncued conditions, {{especially in the case of}} crossmodally graded notifications. They contribute to the knowledge base in multimodal information processing and display design as well as attention/ interruption management. This work goes beyond earlier studies by comparing the robustness of peripheral visual and tactile notifications under high workload and by exploring not only intra- but also crossmodal gradation in interruption cueing. At an applied level, it suggests ways in which future ATC operations can be supported more effectively to ensure the continued safety of the air transportation system...|$|E

40|$|Today popular {{centralized}} Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook or Twitter process {{massive amounts}} of information associated with user content in their platforms. Their approach creates several threats for the privacy of users. Firstly, user data can leak to authorized (e. g., advertising) or unauthorized third parties (external entities). Secondly, centralized OSN are prone to censorship. On the other hand, future decentralized OSN (DOSN) remove the central authority for data management and so effectively such threats. However, they require careful routing to be resilient to failures, access control and data storage at the peer level. This thesis investigates privacy-preserving protocols that aid in detecting and discouraging abusive behavior in future DOSN. In such settings, less metadata is available to participants for analysis. However, to detect abuse {{we may need to}} make use of metadata that represents neighborhood knowledge, namely a social graph or network size/structure. Thus we need to provide privacy-preserving protocols that protect such metadata and are compatible with decentralized settings. We first analyze abusive behavior in Twitter, an existing centralized, subscription based OSN platform. The data model of Twitter is a publish-subscribe messaging infrastructure that allows participants publishing and subscribing to various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> (e. g., news, sports). At the individual level, we conjecture that attackers {{may be more likely to}} abuse potential victims if they can address them via the OSN interface with tools as mentions (e. g., tagging) in Twitter. To verify abuse at the individual level, we start collecting messages directed to potential victims using a data mining framework we build and that programmatically crawls Twitter APIs. We managed to retrieve in the order or hundreds of thousands of tweets and metadata of millions of social relationships from Twitter. Then, we extract a number of features, namely individual measurable properties related to the dataset. To obtain abuse ground truth, we develop a light-weight web platform that provides effective and customizable crowdsourcing of label annotation for a sample of our dataset. The sample contains messages directed towards potential victims of abuse and we ask humans to label the nature of messages following a set of abuse guidelines that provide a non-binary classification choice (undecided, abusive, acceptable). Initially, we consider the problem of abuse classification in a centralized OSN (Twitter). Next, we abstract from the Twitter model and consider DOSN where locally, users only have access to a partial view of the metadata available in the network to perform abuse detection. In turn, we analyze the impact of enforcing privacy into features involving neighborhood knowledge, which requires collection and computation of social graph metadata that is not available to the user locally. In order to use these features in DOSN, we design a signed Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol that protects participant metadata collected and computed by the PSI. In addition, we analyze the resistance of our protocol against adversaries trying to tamper with the value of the PSI features. Finally, we perform data minimization by approximating PSI features and testing supervised learning algorithms for abuse detection. Our results show that approximation of the neighborhood fingerprint that PSI features use for abuse detection is still useful and compatible with DOSN. Le principal objectif de cette thèse est d'évaluer les protocoles qui prennent en considération la protection de la vie privée et qui nécessitent seulement des métadonnées locales pour détecter les comportements malveillants sur les réseaux sociaux décentralisés.

De plus, nous prévoyons d'élaborer une série de recommandations pour construire de futurs réseaux sociaux décentralisés qui découragent ce type des comportements abusifs...|$|E

50|$|Between 5 February and 5 March 1979, {{plans for}} the (northern) section 3 were {{developed}} in the Mannheim town hall. A citizens' initiative against the project had formed. It demanded, among other things, the relocation of the existing and the new railway facilities, the adjacent federal highway and the tram tunnel; the associated costs were calculated by Deutsche Bundesbahn as around DM one billion. The lowering of the railway tracks and a later lowering of the federal highway, which was also demanded, would have improved the poor conditions in {{the centre of the}} Waldhof district. DB found that an underground route would be technically feasible but financially unacceptable.

Despite maintaining the above ground route, improvements could be achieved.
