The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians {{at the spot where}} they were originally discovered and assault the pillbox there, {{while the rest of the}} forces would try a <b>turning</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} factors {{leading to the}} first {{escapement}} clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E

Priority T-junction with road hump on one major arm was investigated for kinematic waves. Automatic traffic counters were installed at each lane of the T-junction for six weeks. Traffic volume, headway, vehicle type and travel speed data were collated and analysed. Results show that right <b>turn</b> <b>movement</b> from the minor will trigger positive traffic shockwave of about 20 km/h, whereas the other <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> are merely subjected to rarefaction waves.

5|$|He {{initially}} alienated many of {{his officers}} and men by publicly denigrating their record in comparison to his Western command. He launched an offensive against the Confederate army of General Robert E. Lee, in which he fell prey to a strategic <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> into his rear areas by Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson. At Second Bull Run, he concentrated his attention on attacking Jackson while the other Confederate corps attacked his flank and routed his army. Following Manassas, Pope was banished far from the Eastern Theater to the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, where he commanded U.S. Forces in the Dakota War of 1862. He was appointed to command the Department of the Missouri in 1865 and was a prominent and activist commander during Reconstruction in Atlanta. For {{the rest of his}} military career, he fought in the Indian Wars, particularly against the Apache and Sioux.|$|E
25|$|From Savannah, after a month-long delay for rest, Sherman marched {{north in}} the spring through the Carolinas, {{intending}} to complete his <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> and combine his armies with Grant's against Robert E.

40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveThe {{greatest}} forces {{experienced by}} bones result from muscular contractions—muscles produce most force in high-velocity eccentric contractions. Bouncing movements, e. g., sprinting or hopping—where such contractions occur—are {{highly beneficial for}} lower limb bones. However, {{there is a growing}} body of evidence that torsional stresses are highly osteogenic. Sports in which frequent quick turning occurs—hence large torsional stresses can be expected—e. g., tennis, may also improve bone strength {{even in the absence of}} large ground reaction and muscle forces. MethodsTo investigate the relative effects of bouncing and <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> on bones, we recruited 47 older men (mean age 62. 4  ±  12. 9 years). They were competitive sprinters (representing exposure to bouncing movement), competitive tennis players (<b>turning</b> <b>movements),</b> and inactive controls. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of tibial diaphysis at 66 % distal–proximal length were taken; muscle sizes from peripheral quantitative computed tomography and countermovement jump performance were also examined. ResultsBone strength of tennis players was clearly greater than that of controls (23 % greater bone mass; p    0. 5). Material eccentricity analysis suggests that torsional stresses may be a significant adaptive stimulus to tibial bone. ConclusionResults suggest that sports with quick <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> are highly osteogenic, even in the absence of greater muscular output. This may be related to the large torsional stresses produced during <b>turning</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Peninsula Campaign (also {{known as}} the Peninsular Campaign) of the American Civil War was a major Union {{operation}} launched in southeastern Virginia from March through July 1862, the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater. The operation, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, was an amphibious <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> against the Confederate States Army in Northern Virginia, intended to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. McClellan was initially successful against the equally cautious General Joseph E. Johnston, but {{the emergence of the}} more aggressive General Robert E. Lee turned the subsequent Seven Days Battles into a humiliating Union defeat.|$|E
25|$|The attack, {{which began}} in the early {{afternoon}} of 13 January—postponed from the morning because of a persistent mist and a slow advance by artillery across the river—quickly lost the intended element of surprise, as the outnumbered British forces on both sides of enemy lines struggled to assert themselves against a robust Ottoman defense. Kemball made a frontal advance, while Younghusband, with the bulk of the British force, attempted a wide <b>turning</b> <b>movement.</b> The delay seriously affected the chances of success, as small-arms and artillery fire from the alerted Ottoman forces began to halt the British infantry movements.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Campo Tenese (10 March 1806) saw two {{divisions}} of the Imperial French Army of Naples led by Jean Reynier attack the left wing of the Royal Neapolitan Army under Roger de Damas. Though the defenders were protected by field fortifications, a French frontal attack combined with a <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> rapidly overran the position and routed the Neapolitans with heavy losses. The action occurred at Campotenese, a little mountain village in the municipality of Morano Calabro {{in the north of}} Calabria. The battle was fought during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
40|$|For most signalized intersections, left-turn {{movements}} are {{considered as a}} primary contributor to intersection delay. The concept of eliminating left-turn movements is now feasible {{with the rise of}} GPS-based routing which will allow the active routing of vehicles in networks with reduced left turns. This research seeks to estimate the impact of left turn reductions on overall travel time and left turn delay at intersections. The research objective is to evaluate the effect of left <b>turn</b> <b>movement</b> elimination in sample networks. The type of intersections considered is restricted to a grid network but is defined by the roadway hierarchy. A sample network was selected based on a real world network and reflecting observed volumes, travel times, and delays. The analysis approach is to eliminate left <b>turn</b> <b>movements</b> in three types of intersections by applying turn prohibitions and adjusting cycle lengths and turn penalties on other movements. Network performance is then assessed based on delay reduction, total travel time, and fuel consumption. It was concluded that selective reduction of left <b>turn</b> <b>movements</b> can improve network performance...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, some intersections have a three-lens signal without arrows with an {{adjoining}} three-lens signal (with arrows) governing exclusive left- or right-turns. Signals with circular lenses generally control all movements. At such intersections, the exclusive turn signals {{indicate that there}} are no permissive <b>turn</b> <b>movements</b> at that intersection, and that only exclusive <b>turn</b> <b>movements</b> are allowed. At those intersections, the signals with circular lenses govern movements in all directions except those in the direction which the turn signal controls. This means {{that if there is a}} left-turn signal and a circular-lens signal at an intersection, the latter signal controls right <b>turns</b> and straight <b>movements,</b> but not left turns. If the former signal is showing a red arrow, and the latter signal is showing a green ball, then motorists cannot turn left even though the latter light is showing a green ball.|$|R
40|$|Ageing drivers {{experience}} {{a higher risk}} of intersection crashes because of their decrease in driving efficiency, including the decline in cognitive ability, head and neck flexibility, and visual acuity. Although several studies have been conducted to examine the factors associated with ageing driver crashes at intersections, little research has been conducted to examine the differences in the factors related to ageing drivers&# 039; turning paths and intersection geometric features. This study aims to improve the safety of ageing drivers at intersections by identifying the maneuvers that are risky for them and tracking their <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> at selected intersections. We find that ageing drivers experience more crashes at intersections than younger drivers, especially crashes involving <b>turning</b> <b>movements.</b> Furthermore, ageing drivers experience more crashes at unchannelized intersections compared to channelized intersections. In addition, this study finds that ageing drivers exhibit greater and more inconsistent offsets during <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> compared to those of younger drivers at both channelized and unchannelized intersections. Ageing drivers also tend to make relatively sharper or tighter turns than younger drivers. Hence, transportation engineers and road safety professionals should consider appropriate countermeasures to reduce the risks of crashes involving ageing drivers at intersections...|$|R

25|$|On August 2021, Pope withdrew to {{the line}} of the Rappahannock River. He was aware of Lee's plan because a Union cavalry raid {{captured}} a copy of the written order. Stuart was almost captured during this raid; his cloak and plumed hat did not escape, however, and Stuart retaliated on August 22 with a raid on Pope's headquarters at Catlett's Station, capturing the Union commander's dress coat. Stuart's raid demonstrated that the Union right flank was vulnerable to a <b>turning</b> <b>movement,</b> although river flooding brought on by heavy rains would make this difficult. It also revealed the plans for reinforcing Pope's army, which would eventually bring it to the strength of 130,000 men, more than twice the size of the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|E

40|$|The {{real-time}} {{traffic signal}} control for intersection requires dynamic <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> {{as the basic}} input data. It is impossible to detect dynamic <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> directly through current traffic surveillance systems, but dynamic origin-destination (O-D) estimation can obtain it. However, the combined models of dynamic O-D estimation and real-time traffic signal control are rare in the literature. A framework for the multiobjective traffic signal control model for intersection based on dynamic O-D estimation (MSC-DODE) is presented. A state-space model using Kalman filtering is first formulated to estimate the dynamic turning movements; then a revised sequential Kalman filtering algorithm is designed to solve the model, and the {{root mean square error}} and mean percentage error are used to evaluate the accuracy of estimated dynamic turning proportions. Furthermore, a multiobjective traffic signal control model is put forward to achieve real-time signal control parameters and evaluation indices. Finally, based on practical survey data, the evaluation indices from MSC-DODE are compared with those from Webster method. The actual and estimated <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> are further input into MSC-DODE, respectively, and results are also compared. Case studies show that results of MSC-DODE are better than those of Webster method and are very close to unavailable actual values...|$|R

He was unsuccessful in persuading them and deployed most of his force on the Peninsula. Following lengthy siege preparations by McClellan at Yorktown, Johnston withdrew and fought a sharp defensive fight at Williamsburg (May 5) and turned back an attempt at an amphibious <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> at Eltham's Landing (May 7).
