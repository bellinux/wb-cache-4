5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual conformational change, which disrupts {{the structure of}} the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The conformational change involves the RCL moving to <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E

5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard from the {{entrance to the}} Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E
5|$|I-195 was {{constructed}} in three sections. The first section was a connection between MD 295 and the airport. This segment was built as Maryland Route 46 and completed in 1951 shortly after {{the opening of the}} airport, which was originally named Friendship International Airport. The second segment was completed at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway in the mid-1970s, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and I-95 with MD 166 and UMBC. The first two segments were connected when the portion between MD 295 and US 1 {{was constructed}} in the late 1980s. The whole length of the highway was completed and was marked as I-195 in 1990. In 2015, the eastern terminus was cut back from the airport to MD 170, with the former section between those two points becoming MD 995A.|$|E

5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 1997, {{an empty}} train {{collided}} with another train waiting to depart Union Station with over 800 passengers on board. The empty train's locomotive engineer was at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train, and the conductor at the leading end failed in {{his attempts to}} relay the situation to the engineer or apply the emergency brake. The two trains then collided at a speed of , causing a partial derailment and minor injuries to fifty-four passengers and two crew members. The subsequent Transportation Safety Board report made recommendations, including making emergency brakes more accessible and that the locomotive engineer must always control the train from the leading end in the Union Station Rail Corridor.|$|E
5|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} (also {{known as}} the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is composed of separate sacs called cisternae. Its shape {{is similar to a}} stack of pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The Golgi apparatus is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the Golgi apparatus that receives the vesicles from the ER is {{known as the}} cis face, and is usually near the ER. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golgi apparatus is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. The trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the Golgi apparatus modifies are sent.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Time was {{intended}} to be matched by a sister fountain, Fountain of Creation, on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Midway. Work was begun but was never completed. The finished portions of Fountain of Creation, depicting figures from the Greek legend of the repopulation of earth after the great flood, are considered Taft's final work, and were given to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, his alma mater. The four surviving elements are figures ranging in height from , and are collectively named Sons and Daughters of Ducalion and Pyrrha. Two of these elements stand outside the entrance to the university's Main Library, and two others are located at the south side of Foellinger Auditorium.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks {{rolled through}} the barbed-wire barrier {{in front of}} Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North Vietnamese tank crews {{destroyed}} several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, {{an adviser to the}} Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North Vietnamese overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North Vietnamese tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North Vietnamese had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The Chimes {{shopping}} centre was built beside Uxbridge station in 2001, incorporating {{many of the}} existing buildings into the new structure. The centre was originally to be named St George's Centre in plans {{dating back to the}} early 1990s, though this name was eventually taken by another {{shopping centre}} in Harrow on the Hill. Instead, The Chimes was said to refer {{to the sound of the}} bells from the nearby market house on the High Street. An Odeon cinema opened as a major part of the centre, with the smaller cinema at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Street closing. Some houses on Chippendale Way and the St George's car park were demolished to allow for the construction of the new shopping centre car park. The offices of the local building company Fassnidge were also included in the new development; built in the 19th century, they now house a Pizza Express restaurant. Preserved timber from earlier demolished buildings in Uxbridge was used in the construction of a new building beside the former offices of Fassnidge, designed to resemble a much older structure.|$|E
