5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Baltic was probably unimportant {{at the time the}} ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E

5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|Weingartner, {{a former}} activist, wrote the film {{based on his}} {{experiences}} and chose to use nonviolent characters.

First shown at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2004 and released in its home countries later that year, The Edukators was praised by critics and audiences. It grossed more than $8million worldwide and received a number of awards and nominations. It did, however, receive criticism mainly for its political statements and also for its long running time.|$|E
5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock has {{distinctive}} territorial markings. Males {{usually take}} dominance {{of an area}} on the ground, although they sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a “court”. Quality of courts {{are known to have}} some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center of activity in the lek. The reason for <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center of activity in the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas. Guianan courts are commonly found in the Guianan Shield, a forested region in northeastern South America.|$|E
