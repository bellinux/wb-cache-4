The {{study of}} low frequency, small size <b>transducer</b> was an {{important}} aspect {{for the development of}} the underwater acoustic <b>transducer.</b> The Class flextensional <b>transducer</b> was a typical low frequency, high-power and small size <b>transducer.</b> For decreasing its resonant frequency in the case of small size, a flextensional <b>transducer</b> with slotted shell was analyzed using finite element software ANSYS.
