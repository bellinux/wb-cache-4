The impacts on consumers have been receiving little attention in earlier tourism research. This study contains an empirical research with a focus on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of travellers during the refugee crisis of 2015. <b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> are seen as interesting for this study since they can affect the traveller before, during and after the trip. In this work <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> further are divided into four different sub-categories, which were detected to be important in order to describe how <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of travellers can be affected from a crisis. The performed study shows that <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> can be affected from a crisis in different ways. It also shows that the refugee crisis of 2015 had impacts on travellers, that might vary from person to person and that they might not be aware of themselves...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to examine}} the influence of a clinical practice on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of diploma nursing students toward the elderly. A pretest-posttest approach, using Kogan's Old People Scale, provided data on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of nursing students upon entry to the diploma nursing program, and the effect of a clinical practice on those attitudes. A comparison was made of the effect of a clinical practice in special care homes and in acute care institutions on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly. Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of nursing students toward the elderly and the demographic characteristics was made. The demographic characteristics examined were age, level of education, previous social contact with the elderly, previous work or volunteer experience with the elderly, religiosity and location of residence. <b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> of <b>the</b> nursing students upon entry to the nursing program were found to be positive. Of the 181 respondents to the pretest, 98. 3 % had positive <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>the</b> elderly according to the Kogan's Old People Scale. No significant change in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly was found following the clinical practice. There was no significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of <b>the</b> students who had a clinical practice in a special care home and those who had a clinical practice in an acute care institution. A significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly was found according to age of the student and the previous social contact the student had had with the elderly. As the age and the amount of social contact with the elderly increased <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of nursing students toward the elderly became more positive. However, students who had lived with an elderly person were less positive in their <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>the</b> elderly. Recommendations for further research were made based on the findings of the study and the research methodology used in this study. These recommendations have significance for persons involved in the education of health care workers, particularly nursing students...|$|R

Even when attitudes are measured, usually, <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> {{of just one}} household member are measured even though household energy consumption {{is the result of}} actions of all household members. This research explored first whether attitudes could help explain heating usage and second whether <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of a couple could explain more of the variability in heating behaviour than <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of one partner. <b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards home heating energy use (i. e. attitudes towards thermal comfort, economical with energy, industry and technology's role and individual's role) of 128 English couples were used in this study. Together with building and socio-demographics, attitudes were examined to explain heating temperatures and durations, which were derived from temperature sensors placed in the homes in 2007 – 2008. The results showed that attitudes helped explain heating temperatures and durations, even when building and socio-demographic variables were controlled. Economical with energy was the most highly identified influence on heating behaviours, with thermal comfort a close second. In households that included a couple, combined attitudes of both partners explained heating usage behaviours more accurately than <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of either male or female only...|$|R
