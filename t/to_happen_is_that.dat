But that's as far as it was allowed to go. The only times the roads were closed was in criteriums, and that was because they were on circuits of just two or three kilometres and it wouldn't be safe to have traffic on them. But that also meant you couldn't have many riders either, so they'd be invitation only. They'd get two or three good riders to attract the crowd, then all the local boys they could get and if there were any places left over you could get one as a foreigner. But essentially they were just by invitation.|$|E

5000|$|Issues {{of local}} control. The planned {{variation}} aspect of Follow Through {{was thought to}} be beneficial—perhaps superior—to other forms of experimentation (e.g., selection of sites based on randomized assignment) because it would give local communities and schools an element of ownership integral to the successful implementation of the models. Despite the planned variation design, local communities in many sites were nevertheless deeply critical of the program. In some ways, criticism of Follow Through had preceded directly from Head Start. Ostensibly, the social service purpose and goals of the Head Start program were clearer than those of the Follow Through evaluation. Nevertheless, community leaders had felt that Head Start did not give enough decision-making responsibility to parents and community members. Local interests wanted to make curricular decisions, including the changing of facets of some program models Evans cautioned that [...] "educational communities and contexts vary", which can have a direct effect on the implementation of a model. More problematic, however, is Elmores and Hills assertions that the Follow Through models interfered with local teaching methods and practices. As Elmore writes, [...] "for Follow Through, the problem was how to implement program variations in a system where most day-to-day decisions about program content are made at the school or classroom level". Rhine et al. suggest {{that it is difficult to}} get teachers to modify their behavior. And if the objective of changing behavior is achieved, teachers feel little ownership on the model—a decidedly dubious investment. What inevitably seems <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> teachers reject programs outright, while others [...] "surrender to the program".|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that under T-duality the sigma model dilaton (which is {{normally}} thought {{to be related to the}} string coupling constant through the simple formula κ = exp ), undergoes an additive shift. On the other hand, Kugo and Zwiebach, using a simplified form of string field theory, claim that the string coupling constant does not change under the T-duality. Obviously, what seems <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> two different coupling constants, associated to different dilatons, are used. In this contribution we shall try to clarify this, and related issues. ...|$|E

During the thesis,said method was built and an experiment was executed with four uniquedesign manipulations that were developed by combining two factors, compactness andvendor credibility.

40|$|Under what {{conditions}} can robots become companions {{and what are}} the ethical issues that might arise in human-robot companionship relations?

For the purpose of these arguments, I make a distinction between empathy-as-cognition and empathy-as-feeling, connecting the latter to the moral sentiment tradition and its concept of “fellow feeling. ” Furthermore, I sympathise with the intuition that vulnerability mirroring raises the ethical issue of deception. However, given the importance of appearance in social relations, problems with the concept of deception, and contemporary technologies that question the artificial-natural distinction, we cannot easily justify the underlying assumptions of the deception objection.
