The song's first televised performance was during the 2014 American Music Awards, where both closed out the show, with Lopez also previewing a new song entitled [...] "Throw Your Hair Back." [...] The performance started out with Lopez in a black and white leotard [...] "that showed off her famous assets", as cited by Allison Takeda from Us Magazine. Takeda continued the description, adding that [...] "later, she was joined onstage by Azalea, who rocked a glittery metallic leotard. As they danced, patterened lights flashed across the stage, covering them in polka dots, stripes, and diamonds. During the performance, Lopez stopped singing <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> ringing cell phone, which she dismissed with the offhand observation, [...] "Just a booty call." [...] Daniel D'Addario of Time named that the performance [...] "was the most dynamic of the night," [...] while Joe Lynch of Billboard called it [...] "a perfect showstopper." [...] Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Music pointed out that it [...] "demonstrated why she deserved the headlining spot of what was otherwise a rather uneventful telecast." [...] Carey Ganz of Rolling Stone selected it as one of the best, praising Lopez for showing that it was her performance, although Azalea was also featured. Ganz noted that [...] "she got to hit all the contortionist high spots, and was the beneficiary of the best production moments. When she and Azalea did share the stage, it was still clear who was in charge. Then, just to further cement her status, Lopez closed the show solo, strutting and shaking her way across the stage before backing it up to Pitbull to send the show home." [...] Lopez has {{performed the}} track regularly since its release as a part of her live shows set list, including on her Mawazine headlining show on May 29, 2015, and on her Las Vegas residency show [...]|$|E
