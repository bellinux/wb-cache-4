5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the chance <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. This is also why they wore highly {{identifiable}} wolfskin headdresses.|$|E
5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} {{that he had to}} prove himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled Don Shula by saying, “I think pro coaches should have <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, Ko {{becomes a}} second-year student and Aoba enters Seishu High School. Yūhei, who stays at Seishu despite having {{been on the}} former first-string team, moves in with Ko's family after the first-stringers' {{dormitory}} is closed. The reformed Seishu team goes on <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> by defeating Sannō High School {{in the first round}} of the summer prefectural qualifying tournament. However, they lose to their second-round opponents, Ryuō, in overtime, ending Seishu's hopes of Koshien for the year. Ryuō subsequently reaches Koshien, advances up to the semifinals where they are narrowly beaten. However, Ryuō then goes on to win the spring invitational Koshien tournament later that same year.|$|E
50|$|Those plays {{pushed the}} {{participants}} even beyond their limit. They were able <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> {{that when you}} put your heart to something and you inspire your mind to do it, no task is insurmountable. Those plays are added feathers to EMITS cap.|$|R
50|$|Scantegrity is a {{security}} enhancement for optical scan voting systems, providing such systems with end-to-end (E2E) verifiability of election results. It uses confirmation codes {{to allow a}} voter <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that their ballot is included unmodified in the final tally. The codes are privacy-preserving and offer no proof of which candidate a voter voted for. Receipts can be safely shown without compromising ballot secrecy.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the twenty}} first century {{there are more}} and more female police officers. However, it is still {{extremely}} difficult for them. They have <b>to</b> constantly <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> over and over, and they are not taken seriously. This reflects two different models, the self-defense model and the women's role in society model.|$|R
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves.</b> Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol was {{conceived}} {{in the late}} 1930s by aviation advocate Gill Robb Wilson, who foresaw general aviation's potential to supplement America's military operations. With the help of New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, {{in his capacity as}} then-Director of the Office of Civilian Defense, CAP was created with , signed by LaGuardia on 1 December 1941 and published 8 December 1941. The Civil Air Patrol had 90 days <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> to Congress. Major General John F. Curry was appointed as the first national commander. Texas oilman David Harold Byrd was a co-founder of CAP.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
50|$|Optimalists accept {{failures}} and also learn from them, which encourages further pursuit of achievement. Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar believes that Optimalists and Perfectionists show distinct different motives. Optimalists {{tend to have}} more intrinsic, inward desires, with a motivation to learn, while perfectionists are highly motivated by a need <b>to</b> consistently <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> worthy.|$|R
50|$|Charles Felix {{was rarely}} present at Turin as king {{and did not}} {{participate}} in the social life of the capital, since he had never sought the throne and had no particular affection for the Turinese, whom he considered <b>to</b> have <b>proven</b> <b>themselves</b> traitors <b>to</b> the dynasty through their support for Napoleon and the constitutional protests.|$|R
50|$|Now {{adequately}} experienced, Penrod enlists Sam {{and the two}} Negro {{boys who}} live across the alley, Herman and Verman, as assistants. Needing a scoundrel to shadow, Penrod overhears his parents jocularly referring to the polished manners of Penrod's young-adult sister Margaret's boyfriend, Mr. Herbert Hamilton Dade, as being appropriate to a horse thief. The rest of the book concerns the increasingly desperate but futile efforts of Penrod and his gang <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that Mr. Dade really does steal horses.|$|R
5|$|Partly due {{to these}} events, and {{partly due to}} the major losses in {{manpower}} Gallia suffers {{towards the end of the}} war with the Empire, the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force. This is short-lived, however, as following Maximilian's defeat, Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire, kept secret by their benefactor. Without the support of Maximilian or the chance <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in the war with Gallia, it is Dahau's last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation. As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations' cease-fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace, Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless, asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed-in-action. Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves, the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon. Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The team's general {{philosophy}} {{at the time}} was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive. Players on the Giants' offense became frustrated over this decision and wanted more chances <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Officers {{were trained}} at the School of Infantry. Freshly {{graduated}} Second Lieutenants had <b>to</b> first <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> in action before being given the responsibility of becoming a stick leader. When these nascent officers joined a Commando, they were normally assigned an experienced NCO as mentor and performed {{the role of a}} rifleman in a stop; in this way new officers learned lessons concerning war not taught in training.|$|R
5000|$|Essentially, {{it is the}} act {{of telling}} one's self (or a group telling themselves) {{something}} that {{they consider to be}} true, or to convince themselves, with the unfortunate repercussion of their having no doubts. Because of what they do to themselves, they will go over every aspect of their side of the [...] "argument" [...] <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that they are right, and will refuse to look at any alternatives. Self-propaganda is a form of self-deception. It functions at individual and social levels: political, economic, and religious. It hides behind partial truths and ignores questions of critical thought.|$|R
50|$|They {{continually}} try <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that they're {{free and}} can make any choice they want. But {{no matter what they}} try (e.g., deliberately flubbing their lines in scenes from their TV show, pointing out to other characters that they're really just actors making a movie, complaining to producers Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson who are on the set but not part of the film, smashing through the painted paper walls, walking off the set and into the street, physically attacking other actors for no reason, and making everyone they encounter mad at them) they discover that their every word and deed was predetermined to the finest detail by the script of the movie they're in and the director directing it.|$|R
25|$|Exhausted by {{the game}} versus France, the Lithuanians still had <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> {{in the final}} against Spain. And while the first quarter was played equally (20–19), {{afterwards}} the Lithuanians dominated and never gave the Spanish any chance. Lithuania won their third European title 93–84 after a 64-year hiatus. Šarūnas Jasikevičius was named MVP, and was included along with Saulius Štombergas in the All-Tournament Team.|$|E
25|$|That season, Smith {{broke his}} ankle in training, {{and missed the}} {{majority}} of the season. However, by the time he made his return to first team action, manager Jim Magilton had left the club and been replaced by Roy Keane. Smith featured heavily in Keane's early games as Ipswich manager, with the former Manchester United midfielder opting to give some of the club's younger talent – such as Connor Wickham and Smith – a chance <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Saga of the Jomsvikings relates {{that the}} Jomsvikings were highly {{selective}} in deciding whom {{to admit to}} their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with {{the exception of a}} boy named Vagn Åkesson, who defeated Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson in single combat at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual duel, or holmgang, with a Jomsviking.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{creator of the}} bitcoin client has described their approach to the software's authorship as it being written first <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> {{that the concept of}} purely peer-to-peer electronic cash was valid and that a paper with solutions could be written. While the majority of peers on the network may use Bitcoin Core, the developers' influence on bitcoin is limited by the choice of which implementation people voluntarily decide to use. The lead developer is Wladimir J. van der Laan, who took over the role on 8 April 2014. Gavin Andresen was the former lead maintainer for the software client. Andresen left the role of lead developer for bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. He left because he didn't want to get involved with trivial decision-making.|$|R
50|$|Always wanting <b>to</b> {{challenge}} and <b>prove</b> <b>themselves,</b> Celtic applied for and were {{admitted to the}} Northern Ireland Intermediate league for the following season, with the first game at this level being played at Regan’s field against Donegal Celtic. The team performed {{with a great deal}} of credibility that season finishing fourth in the league, higher than Institute who now ply their trade in the Irish Premier league.|$|R
40|$|Administrators of {{distance}} learning {{are faced with}} the challenge of encouraging reluctant faculty to consider online teaching. Is it possible that supporting faculty to conduct modest research studies is such an avenue? Currently, many research studies compare student grades or scores from an online course to a more traditional one, ignoring confounding variables, such as individual differences, and the impact of instructional design. Yet despite criticism of the comparison study, it continues to be used. Are faculty using these studies to produce replicable results or are they using this design as a way to explore web-based learning and <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that it is an acceptable innovation? If so, these studies can be seen as more properly the province of qualitative research that chronicles a personal journey focusing on what the researcher has learned rather than producing valid and replicable research results...|$|R
25|$|For {{its fifth}} game, Michigan {{traveled}} to Columbus to play Ohio State. The game presented {{an opportunity for}} Michigan to lay claim to the Big Ten Conference championship. Illinois had previously beaten Ohio State by a 13–0 margin, and Michigan supporters hoped that a greater margin of victory would allow the Wolverines <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> superior to the Illini. Michigan did not achieve the large margin it had hoped for, but won the game 14–0, scoring one point more than Illinois.|$|E
25|$|The Tanduay Rhum Masters {{made its}} PBA {{return in the}} 1999 season, after a 12-year hiatus. This time, the team had a new {{ownership}} in Asia Brewery of Lucio Tan's son, Bong (The Tanduay team in the 1970s and 80s was owned by the Elizalde family). After a runner-up finish in the 1999 All-Filipino Conference, the Rhum Masters failed to advanced in the finals since. To add insult, the deportation of alleged fil-sham Sonny Alvarado and the indefinite suspensions of Eric Menk and Rudy Hatfield (due to lack of documents <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> as a legitimate Fil-American), the management became frustrated.|$|E
25|$|Oakley {{urged that}} women serve in war, though President McKinley {{rejected}} her offer of woman sharpshooters for {{service in the}} Spanish–American War. Beyond this offer to the president, Oakley believed that women should learn to use a gun for the empowering image that it gave. Laura Browder discusses how Oakley's stardom gave hope to women and youth in Her Best Shot: Women and Guns In America. Oakley pressed for women to be independent and educated. She was a key influence {{in the creation of}} the image of the American cowgirl. Through this image, she provided substantial evidence that women are as capable as men when offered the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5000|$|They were lovers for 25 days. Rishaba {{was afraid}} that time changes people affections. Surya tried to appease him but in vain. They decided to put their love to an {{endurance}} test <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that the romance {{was much more than}} infatuation. The endurance test would last until the next valentine. Surya became less and less concentrated with what he did. Pichamuthu, after hearing a sad story of a man, phoned Rishaba to tell her that Surya had been admitted at the hospital in a serious condition. She went at the hospital upset and she didn't find him. She phoned Surya, he answered, and she hung up without talking. Surya knew the matter and slapped his friend. He said to not compare his love to others and Pichamuthu apologized. The lovers suffered the pain of separation.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not enough}} that Max and Sofie and Johanna Holländer {{supplied}} work to Heidesheim craftsmen in economically hard times; they had <b>to</b> further <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> worthy, and this they did lavishly: Max Holländer - if not wholly selflessly - had the Grabenstraße (road) paved at his own expense, on which his chauffeur drove him to Wiesbaden each morning and back in the evening. And at Christmastime, Mrs. Hollander went with a basket on her arm down the Grabenstraße, to give gifts out to the children. Older fellow citizens remember today: “a good-hearted woman!” The impositions against the couple as Jews that had been happening since 1933 grew even worse: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{main idea}} behind {{anonymous}} digital credentials is that users are given cryptographic tokens which allow them <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> statements about <b>themselves</b> and {{their relationships with}} public and private organizations anonymously. This {{is seen as a}} more privacy-friendly alternative to keeping and using large centralized and linkable user records. Anonymous digital credentials are thus related to privacy and anonymity.|$|R
25|$|Each team is {{provided}} with two vehicles to use to get around during a task and can only split into two sub-teams for each task, though for some {{they may also be}} provided with additional items for them to use, an example being a shop space they can sell in; in one particular kind of task used regularly on the show, teams are given a dossier that dictates what items they need to find with specifications that they must adhere to. Although the teams are expected to work together, the competitive nature of the show means that candidates will often focus on their individual roles and needs rather than the greater good of the team, primarily <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>themselves</b> worthy of winning the process and increasing their chances of making it into the Final of the series. During the execution of their task, each team is followed by one of Lord Sugar's aides, who notes down their opinions, observations and thoughts for later reference in the boardroom, mostly on any noteworthy matters, such as performance, mistakes, and issues, minor or serious; while it is rare for them to intervene, they may do so if an issue arises in the team's actions that needs their attention.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{starts the}} process of {{identifying}} personal characteristics that make it more or less likely that an individual will engage with new technology. This initial stage used a postal questionnaire to discover what motivated people to enrol in Community Computing programmes and how it affected their life. Key findings were that some people had a specific need, such as communication with family overseas or helping children with school work, while others needed <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that they could overcome the perceived barrier presented by computers. The majority said the experience had increased their enjoyment of using computers and many described how the increase in confidence had enabled them to do new things. The {{findings of this study}} will be explored in greater depth when some respondents are interviewed. In turn, these results will help formulate questions for people who cannot use computers and who have not come forward to receive training. Finally, it is hoped to offer some solutions as to how these people can be encouraged and supported {{to become part of the}} digital age. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{and experience of}} mature students at the National University of Ireland Maynooth were examined in a study in which {{data were collected from}} the following: detailed questionnaire mailed to all 298 mature students registered at NU 1 Maynooth and returned by 164 (55 %) of them; semistructured interviews with a sample of 20 individuals selected from the 164 respondents based on certain demographic characteristics; and 4 focus groups. Policy regarding national and international changes in higher education (HE) was reviewed along with the literature on financial issues affecting mature students in HE, mature students' relationships and external commitments, and the learning process. The typical mature student was young, single, and childless. Although finance was not the most crucial issue for the respondents, it always lay close to the surface. The main motivations cited for entering the university were to obtain a qualification that would jump-start their careers and <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> that they could get a degree. Those who entered the university with vocational ambitions were most likely to be successful. Twenty-two policy proposals were formulated...|$|R
