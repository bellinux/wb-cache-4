[...] The 103 by 71 ft, three-story structure follows a rectangular plan. There is a single-storylecture hall-auditorium that {{is attached to the}} west side of the building on the basement level.

Both the north and south elevations are divided into seven bays and the east and west elevations are divided into three bays. The most dominate feature is the building's third floor that cantilevers around the entire perimeter of the structure. It is supported by square, pre-cast concrete columns. The building reflects the influence of the Miesian and New Formalism architectural styles. [...] The widows on the first and second floor are panels of tinted glass, with vertical window pairs on the third floor. Matching entrances are located in the center bay on the north and south elevations.

[...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2003 This is a {{study of}} the new skills {{required}} by Telstra staff and the <b>television</b> Network Master <b>Control</b> <b>Room</b> (MCR) staff, to operate and maintain the Digital Video Network (DVN) efficiently, and the training program presented to assist in attaining those skills. The author was the training consultant contracted by Philips Broadcast Television Systems (now Thomson) to refine and deliver the training programs for the Telstra DVN, one of the two foci of this study. The other focus was the change or changes in work processes of staff working with the DVN for Telstra and the TV Networks. The study explored the appropriateness of the training program in transferring these required skills and the learning outcomes of training programs used. The study also evaluates the new skills that are required by Telstra and the television network MCR staff to control and operate the DVN. Telstra DVN employees and all the main television networks MCR staff were invited {{to take part in the}} study. The data collected from the study were analysed and the conclusions resulting from the analysis produced a series of recommendations that, if implemented, should improve the effectiveness of these two groups studied by increasing the learning outcome of future training programs and improving the skill levels.

40|$|A <b>control</b> <b>room</b> {{is defined}} as a {{functional}} entity with an associated physical structure, where the operators carry out the centralized control, monitoring and administrative responsibilities. Emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> acts as an alternative <b>control</b> <b>room</b> for the purpose of shutting down or maintaining the facility in a safe shutdown state when the main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is uninhabitable. The mission of emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is to provide the resources to bring the plant to a safe shutdown condition after an evacuation of the main <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> An evacuation of the main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is assumed when there is no possibility to accomplish tasks involved in the shutdown except reactor trip.
