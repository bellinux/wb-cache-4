"At birth {{they were}} exactly alike, except {{that one was}} born with a bad varicose affection, the effect of which had been to prevent any violent exercise, such as dancing or running, and, as she has grown older, to make her more serious and thoughtful.

Up he comes to me, and as he came I looked at him, and said to myself, 'You are a drunkard you are, and a rogue, it's written on your face, and, what's more, I know your face.'

60|$|Mr. Cargill gazed on {{the young}} nobleman as he {{pronounced}} these words, with the easy indifference of one who apologizes to an inferior {{in order to maintain}} his own character for politeness, but with perfect indifference whether his excuses are or are not held satisfactory. And as the clergyman gazed, the belief which had so strongly clung to him that the Earl of Etherington and young Valentine Bulmer were the same individual person, melted away like frostwork before the morning sun, and that so completely, that he marvelled at himself for having ever entertained it. Some strong resemblance of features there must have been to have led him into such a delusion; but the person, the tone, the manner of expression, were absolutely different; and his attention being now especially directed towards these particulars, Mr. Cargill was inclined to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> personages almost totally dissimilar.|$|E

500|$|Kutzer <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sequels {{not up to}} Potter's usual {{narrative}} standards {{because both}} sprang from a public demand for more [...] "bunny books" [...] rather than from any desire on Potter's part to continue the rabbit stories. Neither of the tales spoke to Potter emotionally {{in the manner of}} Peter Rabbit, she points out, and speculates that Potter associated rabbits with the less than happy life she passed in her parents' London home. Kutzer believes that once Potter gained a life of her own and freed herself from domineering parents, she was reluctant to return to material which evoked unpleasant memories.|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR SIR,--I was {{not aware}} that old Sir Thomas had {{anticipated}} that story, and I am much obliged to you for furnishing me the paragraph. It is curious that the same idea should leave entered two heads so unlike {{as the head of}} that wise old philosopher and that of Captain Ned Wakeman, a splendidly uncultured old sailor, but in his own opinion a thinker by divine right. He was an old friend of mine of many years' standing; I made two or three voyages with him, and found him a darling in many ways. The petroleum story was not told to me; he told it to Joe Twichell, who ran across him by accident on a sea voyage where I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> were the only passengers. A delicious pair, and admirably mated, they took to each other at once and became as thick as thieves. Joe was passing under a fictitious name, and old Wakeman didn't suspect that he was a parson; so he gave his profanity full swing, and he was a master of that great art. You probably know Twichell, and will know that that is a kind of refreshment which he is very capable of enjoying.|$|E
6000|$|... 65. Hold, then, {{steadily}} {{the first}} tradition about this Arnolfo. That his real father was called [...] "Cambio" [...] matters to you not a straw. That he never called himself Cambio's Arnolfo--that nobody else ever called him so, down to Vasari's time, is an infinitely significant fact to you. In my twenty-second letter in Fors Clavigera {{you will find}} some account of the noble habit of the Italian artists to call themselves by their masters' names, considering their master as their true father. If not {{the name of the}} master, they take that of their native place, as having owed the character of their life to that. They rarely take their own family name: sometimes it is not even known,--when best known, it is unfamiliar to us. The great Pisan artists, for instance, never bear any other name than 'the Pisan;' among the other five-and-twenty names in my list, not above six, I <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> German, with four Italian, are family names. Perugino, (Peter of Perugia,) Luini, (Bernard of Luino,) Quercia, (James of Quercia,) Correggio, (Anthony of Correggio,) are named from their native places. Nobody would have understood me if I had called Giotto, 'Ambrose Bondone;' or Tintoret, Robusti; or even Raphael, Sanzio. Botticelli is named from his master; Ghiberti from his father-in-law; and Ghirlandajo from his work. Orcagna, who did, for a wonder, name himself from his father, Andrea Cione, of Florence, has been always called 'Angel' by everybody else; while Arnolfo, who never named himself from his father, is now like to be fathered against his will.|$|E
