A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E

2500|$|No one {{was really}} safe from {{scrutiny}} or <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> <b>block,</b> ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although {{the vast majority}} of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis [...] "'La Généreuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802", Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat [...] "disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes". [...] Also, captains and sailors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} earn a little on the side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with nothing. Yet still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace.|$|E

50|$|In {{gridiron}} football, a <b>chop</b> <b>block</b> is {{an attempt}} by an offensive player to cut block (block at the thigh level or lower) a defensive player while the defender is already engaged by another offensive player. <b>The</b> <b>chop</b> <b>block</b> is usually considered illegal and penalized by a loss of 15-yards due to the injury risk it presents to the defender.|$|R

5000|$|Before the 2016 NFL owners meeting, <b>chop</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were legal}} under certain circumstances.

50|$|Ma {{is arguably}} the best two-winged looper in table tennis history. His serves appear to be {{traditional}} pendulum serves, but {{are some of the}} most visually deceptive in the world. Ma's playing style is that of the modern strategy of close-range third ball play. At the beginning of his career, his play strategy was primarily forehand-oriented, dominating play with powerful forehand loops, only using his backhand for controlled returns and to set up the forehand. He still plays a forehand-oriented style, but his backhand has become more consistent and stable as his career has progressed. Ma uses his backhand mainly to aggressively block incoming loops, but will occasionally loop himself. Opponents are usually caught off guard when he suddenly loops with his backhand, which he can do near the table or away from it. Compared to when he was younger, he is much more confident using his backhand to attack and defend. He is also the most prominent employer of <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> <b>block</b> on <b>the</b> Chinese National Team, which he uses to cross up his opponents when he is out of position or to counter slow loops with heavy side spin.|$|R

However, an ambitious plan to move Richmond's home games to the neighbouring Melbourne Cricket Ground, overhaul the administration and spend big money on a recruiting campaign, really got underway in 1964.
