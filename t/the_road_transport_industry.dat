Because <b>the</b> rural <b>road</b> goods <b>transport</b> <b>industry</b> provides an unscheduled service, rate setting by Government is not clearly consistent with economic efficiency. The forces of price competition are not acting to reduce prices. Rather, farmers are paying for the luxury of service competition with rates being fixed by a third party, within a narrow range and on a cost plus criterion. It is suggested that minimum rate controls should be removed, that rates charged should more closely reflect cost differences and that controls over entry to the industry should be relaxed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the deregulation of <b>the</b> international <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industry</b> in Western Europe has affected 1 - the total quantity of cross-border <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in <b>the</b> region; 2 - {{the degree to}} which shippers outsource rather than integrate vertically their cross-border transport needs; and 3 - the extent to which different countries participate in international <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> in Western Europe. Not surprisingly, we find that deregulation has had a large positive effect on the amount of international <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> net of <b>the</b> effect of the trade ties that grew over time among European Union countries. Moreover, consistent {{with the fact that the}} regulation disproportionately affected for-hire trucking, we find that deregulation has led shippers to shift toward more for-hire transport as opposed to own-account or private haulage. However, despite concerns voiced by member countries, we find no evidence that deregulation has disproportionately favored carriers of countries that were initially more (or less) intensively involved in international haulage...|$|R

The higher fatality rates on Australian roads compared to Great Britain and the United States maybe largely explained by the lower proportion of truck travel on divided and limited access roads in Australia, and possibly truck speed limits. Areas that have the potential to improve the safety performance of the heavy vehicle industry include road standards, targeted low cost road safety treatments, single vehicle crashes, day and night time driving, measures to improve the safety of truck occupants, front and rear underrun protection, appropriate speed limits, and data collection...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates whether factors within {{transaction}} cost economics such as information asymmetry influence inter-firm relationships. The research proposes that when {{factors such as}} high levels of information sharing is present, firms {{are more likely to}} engage in more complex relationships such as collaboration and alliances than more complex and short-term oriented relationships such as arm’s length. This study uses data from <b>the</b> Australian <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>industry</b> mail survey and interviews. The preliminary results demonstrate that due to the price driven and commoditised nature of the freight <b>transport</b> <b>industry,</b> transactions costs via strategic information sharing, decrease as relationship becomes complex.

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a measure that links the causes and {{consequences}} of disruptions in freight transport operations. Such a measure is needed to quantify the scale of impact and identify the root causes of disruptions. Design/methodology/approach– In order to develop this measure, an inductive approach was adopted, using four primary case studies to test the measure in an industrial environment. The case studies are from the fast moving consumer goods sector with primary and secondary distribution networks included. The “Extra Distance” measure has been evaluated against established generic criteria that define the quality of any performance measure. Findings– The research indicates good compliance with the criteria used to evaluate the “Extra Distance” measure. The measure is also found to be useful for practitioners who are able to directly relate the measure to their distribution network operations. Research limitations/implications– Further research should see the “Extra Distance” measure further tested in other freight transport operations and industrial sectors. Practical implications– The measure is directly related to a number of causes of uncertainty which helps freight transport managers to quickly identify potential solutions. The “Extra Distance” measure can be used to quantify the effects of disruptions which can occur in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> networks generate unnecessary cost within distribution networks, potentially eroding profit margins which are known to be very low in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>industry.</b> Originality/value– This paper presents a novel approach to the assessment of the impact caused by uncertainty within freight transport operations...|$|R
40|$|Research {{shows that}} climate changes we face {{today is a}} {{consequence}} of the increasing amounts of greenhouse gases that circulate in our atmosphere due to increased human industrial activity. Many firms and industries are therefore increasingly implementing environmental management strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions towards a more sustainable environment. These environmental management efforts can be broadly classified under two umbrellas which are sustainable production and sustainable consumption and these two parts need to work together in order to contribute effectively towards a more sustainable environment. The environmental management literature however reveals a gap between sustainable production and sustainable use of vehicles in the automotive industry showing that while the major global environmental impact - greenhouse gas emissions - occurs when vehicles are put to use, the environmental management efforts in the industry are skewed to the production of vehicles. An emerging trend to breach this gap is that vehicle manufacturers are providing extending services to help vehicle users minimize their greenhouse gas emissions. This study analyses the extended service packages of the global truck manufacturer, Scania, against the environmental objectives and initiatives of five <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> companies in Sweden. An exploratory case study approach was used from the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> companies to find out if extended services present suitable opportunities to extend environmental management from manufacturers to users in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> study found that the extended services provide solutions that help road freighttransport companies to achieve lower fuel consumption and lower emissions from theirvehicles. <b>Road</b> freight <b>transport</b> companies traditionally invest in environmental initiatives to gain marketing advantages but the extended services present a rare opportunity to the companies to compete on profit margins by investing in the extended services.
