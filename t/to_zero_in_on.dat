Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter.

To make matters worse, the complex firing mechanism was vulnerable to damage at the hands of inexperienced crews.

40|$|ABSTRACT—The United States is {{becoming}} increasingly diverse, yet interracial contact continues to be awkward, if not stressful, for many. Indeed, recent research suggests that individuals often exit interracial interactions feeling drained both cognitively and emotionally. This article re-views research examining how interracial encounters give rise <b>to</b> these outcomes, <b>zeroing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the mediating role of self-regulation and the moderating influence of prejudice concerns. Given that interracial contact {{may be the most}} promising avenue to prejudice reduction, it is important to examine factors that undermine positive interracial contact experiences, as well as those that facilitate them. KEYWORDS—interracial interactions; self-regulation; pre-judice As the United States becomes increasingly diverse, contact with individuals of different ethnicities, races, and cultures will no longer be rare. Although increased contact may have positive effects over time (see Pettigrew&Tropp, 2006), {{there is reason to believe}} that increased interracial contact may initially result in a host of negative side effects. Research has found, for instance, that interracial interactions induce a relatively malignant form of cardiovascular reactivity in most White individuals (Blasco...|$|R

40|$|A {{long-term}} campaign {{devoted to}} the measurement of fluxes of nitrogen oxides and ozone at {{the surface of a}} temperate deciduous forest was carried out from 1 st September 2012 to 31 st December 2013, using automated dynamic chambers. Soil temperature and water content profiles were recorded near the chambers in order to clarify the short-term response of the fluxes to these two variables. Bulk soil resistances against NO, NO 2 and O 3 emission or deposition were also estimated in order to understand their daily and seasonal variations. Nitric oxide was almost exclusively emitted and the annual average soil emission of 27. 4 g N m− 2 h− 1 was higher than those for other deciduous European forests. The maximum daily peaks of NO emission exceeded 100 g N m− 2 h− 1 during summertime and were close <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> winter time. <b>On</b> annual basis the N balance of the ecosystem as NOx showed a net emission towards the atmosphere of 1. 1 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1.

NO emission fluxes depended exponentially on soil temperature and decreased at high levels of soil water content during summertime, suggesting that the main contribution was due to aerobic nitrification processes. Soil deposition fluxes of NO 2 and O 3 were mainly governed by atmospheric processes related to the atmosphere / soil concentration differences.
