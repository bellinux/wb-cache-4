500|$|Curtis P. Iaukea {{was celebrated}} as a Hawaiian {{who survived the}} monarchy and lived to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was also {{regarded}} as representing all that was apparently good about becoming American, even though {{until the end of}} his life the photos of my great-great-grandfather show him proudly wearing the uniforms and medals that accompanied his trips to faraway places as a diplomat for the Hawaiian Kingdom. He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its own existence in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and used my great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its [...] "evidence of inheritance." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter 42, Sleipnir's origins are described. Gangleri (described {{earlier in}} the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and what there is to <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> High expresses {{surprise}} in Gangleri's {{lack of knowledge about}} Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set [...] "right {{at the beginning of the}} gods' settlement, when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall" [...] about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.|$|E
