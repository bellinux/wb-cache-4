40|$|Two {{sensitive}} voltammetric techniques (adsorptive and catalytic cathodic stripping) {{are described}} for {{the determination of}} <b>timonacic,</b> {{in the presence of}} copper or nickel ions, respectively. The measured peaks which correspond to the reduction or copper (I) or nickel - <b>timonacic</b> complexes are measured at - 773 and - 782 mV, respectively. The different experimental parameters have been carefully studied. The methods have been fully validated. The detection limits were 1. 5 and 13. 6 ng mL- 1, respectively. The methods have been applied for the determination of <b>timonacic</b> in pharmaceutical tablets. The obtained results have been compared statistically with those obtained from a published method...|$|E
