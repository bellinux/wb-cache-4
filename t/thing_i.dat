5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because I wrote the whole <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|First <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> {{saw these}} guys as scientifically {{accomplished}} but ethically, morons. They {{never had any}} reasons before to have ethical questions. So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The first thing they do is make money with it. They're {{not talking about the}} ethics of altering your former self.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA. Believe it! Why, that's myself---myself all over. I know what's {{right and}} dignified {{and strong and}} noble, {{just as well as}} she does; but oh, the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> do! the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> do! the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> let other people do!! ...|$|R

5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
25|$|Emin's two self-portraits taken {{inside her}} beach hut, The Last <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here I (2000) and The Last <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here II (2000) are a diptych {{although}} they are often exhibited and sold separately.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the album, and its title track, is a {{reference}} to Robert Louis Stevenson novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. According to Hartman, it [...] "is an intriguing look at the internal battle between right and wrong. It's about the fighting that goes on inside of us. It's like when Paul said, 'The <b>things</b> <b>I</b> want to do are the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> don't do, and the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> don't want to do are the <b>things</b> that <b>I</b> do.'" ...|$|R

6000|$|In all seriousness--without {{meaning to}} be frivolous--without meaning to be irreverent, {{and more than}} all, without meaning to be blasphemous,--I state as my simple {{deduction}} from the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have seen and the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have heard, that the Holy Personages rank thus in Rome: ...|$|R

25|$|It {{was at a}} meeting, {{just before}} the Six Day War. It was a meeting in New York, and I {{had to make a}} speech. Before that, the Holocaust had never been {{essential}} to my ideology. However, when the chairman said, 'You've got to face it,' I had to face it. I said the most important <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ever said.|$|E
25|$|All I ask {{of you is}} one <b>thing...</b> <b>I</b> {{ask this}} {{particularly}} {{of the young people}} who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism.

60|$|What a queer blunder that was, {{about the}} baronet. I can't quite see how I ever made it. There was an opulent {{abundance}} of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> didn't know; and consequently {{no need to}} trench upon the vest-pocketful of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> did know, to get material for a blunder.|$|R
60|$|What can {{you mean}} about your ignorance--or my astonishment at it? Indeed {{you are a}} naughty little Susie to think such <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> never come to the Thwaite but you and your sister tell me all kinds of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> didn't know, and am so glad to know.|$|R
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people in}} town still assert that the Camp is a haven of bliss. I was at the camp to-day, and just in one little corner {{this is the sort}} of <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> found – The nurse, underfed and overworked, just sinking on to her bed, hardly able to hold herself up, after coping with some thirty typhoid and other patients, with only the untrained help of two Boer girls–cooking as well as nursing to do herself.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> have my reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it's a failure, I'll probably leave this country and never come back. And I mean it.|$|E
