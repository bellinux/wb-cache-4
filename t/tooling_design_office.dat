50|$|An {{important}} part of the 4CV's success was due to the new methodologies used in its manufacture, pioneered by Pierre Bézier. Bézier had begun his 42-year tenure at Renault as a tool setter, moving up to tool designer and then becoming head of the <b>Tool</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Office.</b> As Director of Production Engineering in 1949, he designed the transfer lines (or transfer machines) producing most of the mechanical parts for the 4CV.

40|$|For a <b>design</b> of an <b>office</b> chair, the {{pressure}} distribution of human body {{load on the}} chair seat has to be known. This information is the key characteristic of an office chair. This thesis concerns a mechanical model, its implementation and simulation of a human body sitting on an office chair’s wooden seat cushion. Firstly, Autodesk Inventor is used for modelling the human body, and the seat cushion. Secondly, we use the finite element method to mesh the models. Thirdly, fixed support and gravity load for the models are applied. Finally, {{the pressure}} distribution on the contact area is simulated in Autodesk Inventor. The peak pressure comes out in the contact area between ischium and seat cushion, what matches results from former reports, based on {{the measure of the}} pressure distribution of the contact region between human body and seat cushion using many sensors. Furthermore one can see different sitting postures for different seating positions. Besides, the peak deformation of the seat cushion occurs at almost the same place as peak pressure does. The simulation anatomical based model may be a good and efficient <b>tool</b> to <b>design</b> an <b>office</b> chair seat cushion. The anatomical based design can reduce musculoskeletal disorders caused by office work. This thesis provides a solution of the pressure distribution of different sitting postures on different people’s buttock when they are sitting on a chair. Solidworks and Autodesk Inventor are used to simulate this pressure distribution according to finite element method...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis work done at SAAB Bofors Dynamics AB between September 2005 and January 2006. The purpose of the work was to design a {{balanced}} low-noise amplifier covering the X-band (8. 12 GHz) using the GMIC (Glass Microwave Integrated Circuit) process provided by M/A-COM, Tyco Electronics UK Limited. This thesis work has resulted in an approved and functional balanced low-noise amplifier design. The manufacturer, M/A-COM, reviewed the design for manufacturability only and takes no responsibility for the electrical performance. The amplifier has been designed to have a flat frequency response and low reflections on the input and output. Of course, the noise performance has also been taken into consideration during the design process. This thesis report covers the whole design flow in a chronological order. The layout work and most of the simulations were accomplished by using the <b>design</b> <b>tool</b> Microwave <b>Office</b> from Applied Wave Research. For complex structures such as Lange couplers and spiral inductors, more accurate simulation models were obtained by using HFSS (High Frequency Structure Simulator) from Ansoft...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) {{has become an}} {{important}} issue – albeit often scarcely applied – {{in the design of}} commercial buildings. To encourage the adoption of sustainable strategies in the practice of design and to address the environmental problems caused by these developments, governments and organisations of various countries have proposed the adoption of scorecard rating tools to inform designers of the impact of their decisions and to present a way of establishing project goals and objectives early in the design process. In Australia, the recent introduction of the Green Star Rating <b>Tool</b> (<b>Office</b> <b>Design)</b> is believed to provide the architects with a ‘whole-of-building’ assessment of the environmental impact of their design by creating a checklist against which to benchmark performance. This paper follows the design of a commercial building, evaluating the impact of Green Star in the overall process. The results of the study suggest the need to include the use of scorecard rating tools in a more integrated model, where ESD is considered at every stage of design and construction rather than being a separate component applied only to promote the ‘greenness’ of a building. Rating tools can be an asset to the design team, provided sustainable requirements are reinforced throughout the entire process. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Master’s thesis was to find an {{integration}} {{framework and}} process between Cargotec Tampere’s main <b>design</b> <b>office</b> and locally situated <b>design</b> <b>offices.</b> The problem had been {{that there was no}} defined process to integrate the local small offices with the main global office at Tampere. Without a defined process and tools it is difficult to achieve good efficiency from the start. The thesis was made with qualitative constructive research methods. The three main research processes were literature review, interviews and two case studies inside Cargotec. For the literature review, three research areas were studied: global engineering networks, virtual teams and supplier integration. From those three areas a synthesis was developed, called the combined theoretical model for <b>design</b> <b>office</b> integration. The interviews covered approximately 15 different people. From the interviews the current situation of integration and the requirements for the practical framework were synthesized. The two case studies on Cargotec’s <b>design</b> <b>office</b> in China and a daughter company, MacGregor, are based on interviews with managers, whose job it was to manage and develop offshored <b>design</b> <b>offices.</b> They are presented as individual evidence on the difficulties and lessons learned. When researching and interviewing employees, it became clear that there were many problems with achieving good integration at Cargotec. First, {{there had to be a}} clear sense of what kind of capabilities the new office had. Second, what materials and training should Cargotec give to the new office to match the main office’s capabilities? To improve the situation, an integration framework and three tools were created. The framework and tools are derived from the combined theoretical model. The framework consists of three phases: Survey, Sharing and Verification. The survey phase defines the needs for a new <b>design</b> <b>office,</b> maps and evaluates the capabilities of the prospective <b>design</b> <b>office,</b> and evaluates the offshoring risks. For this, the phase two tools, called current state analysis and risk assessment, were developed. The sharing phase defines and shares all the materials and other resources that the host <b>design</b> <b>office</b> would need to get to the same level with the main <b>design</b> <b>office</b> regarding software, network, skills, material and product knowledge. For this phase, an Excel-tool called the integration package was developed. The last phase, verification, is meant to verify the results of the sharing phase by giving the new <b>design</b> <b>office</b> a pilot task, which tests the new office’s systems, knowledge and communication. The testing of the framework and its tools showed that they were mature enough to be used at Cargotec. /Kir 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To {{develop a}} {{practical}} <b>design</b> <b>tool</b> employing a general purpose electromagnetic finite element (FE) software package to perform automated simulation and performance analysis of induction motors in a design and optimisation process. Design/methodology/approach – Recent publications identified a suitable approach in applying 2 D finite-element analysis to 3 D problems. This, {{together with other}} similar work carried out on brushless DC motors, set out a framework for program development. Performance {{of the program was}} validated against practical test data. Findings – Finite-element analysis-based <b>design</b> <b>tools</b> can be realistically employed within a <b>design</b> <b>office</b> environment and are capable of providing solutions within acceptable time scales. Such tools no longer require user expertise in the underlying FE modelling method. The multiple slice technique was employed to model skew in three-phase induction motors and it was established that a four-slice model provides a good balance between accuracy and speed of computation. Research limitations/implications – Program development was based on one commercial FE software package and comparison with practical test data was not exhaustive. However, the approach outlined confirms the practical application. Future work could consider alternative approaches to optimisation. Practical implications – Computing hardware and commercially available 2 D FE software have developed sufficiently to enable multi-slice techniques and optimisation to be employed in the analysis and design of machines. Originality/value – This paper provides a practical illustration of how commercial electromagnetic software can be employed as a <b>design</b> <b>tool,</b> demonstrating to industry that such tools no longer need to be bespoke and can realistically be used within a <b>design</b> <b>office...</b>|$|R
