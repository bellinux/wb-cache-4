500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that although it is [...] "inevitable" [...] that Homer's car will be a disaster, the [...] "joy of this episode is anticipating exactly what sort of disaster." [...] A member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review that [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{is one of the}} [...] "real winners {{to be found in the}} second season." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the most memorable line of the episode was Homer's idea of the perfect car, [...] "You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car! And some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> snazzy they never go out of style — like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!" ...|$|E
500|$|After xx was released, the xx toured Europe and North America {{through the}} end of 2009. Their first show in August was at Hoxton Hall in London, which Sim {{recalled}} was attended by only 112 people. When Pitchforks positive review of the album elicited greater interest among American listeners, the xx were booked as the supporting act for the Friendly Fires's tour of larger club venues in the US. The difficulties of touring early on exacerbated the growing tensions between Qureshi {{and the rest of the}} group, which culminated in her dismissal after a difficult stay at an October music festival in New York. It was reported that she had become fatigued and left the group after they cancelled several concerts. Sim disputed those reports and said her departure had been the band's decision: [...] "We've grown up to be very different people. It wasn't working any more musically or as a friendship." [...] Croft told NME in November, [...] "I guess 'personal differences' would be the standard way to say it. I guess it's just the intensity of being on tour, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> much heightened." ...|$|E
500|$|Srimanthudu {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Srimanthudu a [...] "star-driven film {{with a strong}} plot that's worth a watch". Dundoo further stated, [...] "This isn't Ashutosh Gowariker Swades, where Shah Rukh Khan finds his true calling {{in a much more}} realistic manner. The social consciousness comes coated with commercially viable ingredients and still, makes for an engaging watch". Sify called Srimanthudu a [...] "right mix of Mahesh's emotional and class performance, Shruthi's charisma, fine storyline and all materials that are needed for a good entertainer". The reviewer appreciated Siva for not writing a separate comedy track to distract from the story. Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "You could say this movie is Mahesh Babu's Swades (the 2004 SRK film) albeit a little dumbed down. Or a Mirchi (the Prabhas film) rehashed. Yet there can be no denying that Srimanthudu achieves more than any big ticket Tollywood potboiler has in more in that last decade , {{for the simple reason that}} it is a drama made like one." [...] Sethumadhavan N of the Bangalore Mirror rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Make no mistake, Srimanthudu is certainly a big commercial entertainer and has most of the elements needed for the same. But to deliver a total commercial which doesn't have a great plot and yet remaining engaging all the way isn't easy at all. That is where the writing by Siva emerges triumphant." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Though there are a few hiccups, Srimanthudu is a good emotional drama with excellent performance by Mahesh Babu, supported by good content with neat dialogues". Hemanth Kumar C.R. of Outlook India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, [...] "In an industry where weaving a story to suit the image of an A-list star is common, Mahesh Babu's latest, Srimanthudu, takes a different course. The film might lack a big-starrer firepower, but by letting go of such conventions, what we get in the end is a sensible film full of heart and humanity." [...] IndiaGlitz rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and called Srimanthudu a [...] "family entertainer with mass appeal, thanks to Mahesh's understated acting" [...] and added, [...] "Koratala Shiva doesn't really unleash a Mirchi-fied Mahesh Babu even in the second half. All throughout, the billionaire Srimanthudu maintains his composure even when he has to turn into a 'hanthakudu'. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> understated that the fight-to-finish itself looks half-done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh yes; I {{will hear}} you certainly, only {{this kind of}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> painful to all parties, and I don't see the use of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] I said, colouring, [...] "if {{he were to}} ask {{her again}} she might accept him. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> {{different}} here in England, {{and he is a}} famous man now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> bad as that," [...] said Rowland, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that you ought to find nothing easier than to {{dispatch}} the Cavaliere to bring the guilty couple back." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} a little gesture. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm almost bewildered. The <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> simple. Why didn't Merril think of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my love, the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> seriously matter-of-fact, that it {{is better}} to look at it in a matter-of-fact way. I don't want your father to die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> hot jest {{now that}} it won't pay to take any more risks than are {{absolutely}} necessary. What we want is {{to get out of}} this portion of the country as soon as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, those <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> {{different}} in Spain that it's {{almost impossible to}} make an Englishman understand them. One learns to know all this sort of people by being {{with them in the}} country, but one can't explain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} the soil is unproductive," [...] said Mohi, [...] "that these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so.</b> It is {{extremely}} fertile; but the inhabitants say that {{it would be wrong to}} make a Bread-fruit orchard of the holy island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>so.</b> You saw Harry Mulford, {{living and}} well, {{and ready to}} hunt you to the gallows. Beware of him, then; and beware of his {{handsome}} wife!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that you would take care of me?" [...] she said softly. [...] "I am afraid I am a very ignorant little person. I do not know much about England or English ways, and every one says that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> {{different}} here." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR JOE,--Apparently {{we are not}} {{proposing to}} set the Filipinos free and give their islands to them; and {{apparently}} we are not proposing to hang the priests and confiscate their property. If these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>so,</b> the war out there has no interest for me.|$|E
