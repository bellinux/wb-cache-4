Aiming at the credibility of multimedia, we present a semi-fragile watermark based on the image permutation. Watermarking detection is performed without resorting to the host image {{and it is only}} controlled by secrete keys, thus the whole scheme does not have certain security gaps. The simulation experiments show that it can survive the JPEG compression and effectively specify the region of the image that has been modified maliciously. key words: watermark, <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing,</b> permutation, transform, semifragile 1...|$|R

In this paper, we discuss the implementation of digital watermarking in the digital camera environment using a fragile watermark embedded in the discrete wavelet domain of the images. We propose an architecture to implement the scheme under the constraints of the digital camera environment, such as with a limited computation power. We also evaluate the versatility of the scheme to detect and characterize signal modifications from a number of distortions, such as substitution of data, filtering, and lossy compression, through software simulation.

We specifically {{address the problem of}} fragile digital watermarking for the <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> of still images. Applications of our problem include authentication for courtroom evidence, insurance claims, and journalistic photography. We present a novel fragile watermarking approach which embeds a watermark in the discrete wavelet domain of the image by quantizing the corresponding coefficients. Tamper detection is possible in localized spatial and frequency regions. Unlike previously proposed techniques, this novel approach provides information on specific frequencies of the image that have been modified. This allows the user to make application-dependent decisions concerning whether an image, which is JPEG compressed for instance, still has credibility. Analysis is provided to evaluate the performance of the technique to varying system parameters. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed method to existing fragile watermarking techniques to demonstrate the success and potential of the method for practical multimedia <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> and authentication...|$|R

Several application scenarios {{in the security}} of digital watermarking have been pointed out, each of them with different requirements.

While robust watermarks, which survive to any change or alteration of the protected documents, are typically used for copyright protection, <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> and authentication generally require fragile or semi-fragile watermarks in order to detect modified or faked documents. Further, most of robust watermarking schemes are vulnerable to the so-called copy attack, where a watermark can be copied from one document to another by any unauthorized person, making these schemes inefficient in all authentication applications.

The OCM will not allow the oil concentration of the exiting water to be above the Marpol standard of 15 ppm. This standard was first adopted in 1977 with Resolution A.393(X) which was published by IMO. These standards were updated various but the most current resolution is MEPC 107(49). The oil content meter will sound an alarm if the liquid leaving the system has an unsatisfactory amount {{of oil in the}} mixture. If it is still above that standard, then the bilge water will be reentered into the system until it meets the required criteria. The OCM uses light beams to determine how oily the water in the system is. The system will then gauge the oil concentration based on a light intensity meter. Modern oil content meters also have a data logging system that can store oil concentration measurements for more than 18 months.If the OCM determines that there is far too much of a type of oil, the OCM may be fouled and needs to be flushed out. Running clean water through the OCM sensor cell is one way it can be cleaned. Also scrubbing the sensor area with a bottle brush is another effective method. The new MEPC 107(49) regulations have set out stringent actions that require the OCM to be <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> and also the OCM needs to have an alarm that sounds whenever the OCM is being cleaned.

5000|$|The split tally was a {{technique}} which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, {{in order to}} record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received {{one half of the}} marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually <b>tamper</b> <b>proof.</b> One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called stock and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called foil and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the Napoleonic Code (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333. [...] Along the Danube and in Switzerland the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.|$|E
