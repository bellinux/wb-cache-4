25|$|The memoirs {{suggest that}} Kim Il-sung was {{influenced}} by communism, Christianity, Confucianism, Cheondoism and wide range of other traditions. Kim Il-sung {{was born in a}} Presbyterian Christian family, even though he downplays their devotion in his memoirs. The anti-foreign pro-independence Donghak Movement, founded by a Korean scholar Choe Je-u and influenced by Catholic missionaries, is one of the fascinations of his youth that Kim Il-sung treats at length in the memoirs. The Donghak rebellion served as a model for other contemporary Korean movements combining religion with nationalism. Kim Il-sung describes being intrigued by the native Korean Cheondoism movement that evolved from the Donghak rebellion. Cheondoism believes in the idea <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> equal and bear the spirit of heaven in themselves.|$|E
25|$|Historian Bernard Bailyn {{argues that}} the evangelicalism of the era {{challenged}} traditional notions of natural hierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> equal, so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class. Kidd argues that religious disestablishment, belief in a God {{as the source of}} human rights, and shared convictions about sin, virtue, and divine providence worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that religion played such a critical role. Alan Heimert argues that New Light antiauthoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial American society and {{set the stage for a}} confrontation with British monarchical and aristocratic rule.|$|E

50|$|English {{hypothetical}} universalism {{was developed}} by John Preston, John Davenant, and James Ussher. This scheme teaches that God ineffectually decrees <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>be</b> saved, but because God knows that some men will not have faith he makes an effectual decree to save those whom he predestines to salvation.|$|R
50|$|The Stoics taught <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> {{manifestations of}} the same {{universal}} spirit, and thus by nature equal. Stoicism also held that external circumstances (such as being enslaved) did not truly impede a person from practicing the Stoic ideal of inner self-mastery: It {{has been said that}} one of the more important Roman stoics, Epictetus, spent his youth as a slave.|$|R
25|$|In {{practical}} terms, Louis X effectively abolished slavery {{within the}} Kingdom of France in 1315. Louis continued to require revenues, however, and alighted on a reform of French serfdom {{as a way}} of achieving this. Arguing <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> born free, Louis declared in 1315 that French serfs would therefore be freed, although each serf would have to purchase his freedom. A body of commissioners was established to undertake the reform, establishing the peculium, or value, of each serf. For serfs owned directly by the King, all of the peculium would be received by the Crown – for serfs owned by subjects of the King, the amount would be divided between the Crown and the owner. In the event, not all serfs were prepared to pay in this fashion and in due course Louis declared that the goods of these serfs would be seized anyway, with the proceeds going to pay for the war in Flanders.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> created equal.|$|E
500|$|Like Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln {{argued that}} the Declaration of Independence was a {{founding}} document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified {{more than a decade}} after the Declaration. The Constitution did not use the word [...] "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that [...] "all men are created equal" [...] remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: [...] "Four score and seven years ago [...] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> created equal." ...|$|E

It seemed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> become his friends, and eager to disclaim any share in the mob's action. He put their proffered hands aside and hurried back to Ladue's, which he found close-barred and dark.|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} an {{establishment}} of religion did not necessarily imply <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> free to hold office. Most colonies had a Test Act, and several states retained them for a short time. This stood {{in contrast to the}} Federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for Federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the States.|$|R
5000|$|Whipple {{was known}} for his beliefs <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> created equal, and is quoted as writing [...] "A {{recommendation}} is gone thither for raising some regiments of Blacks. This, I suppose will lay a foundation for the emancipation of those wretches in that country. I hope it will be the means of dispensing the blessings of Freedom to all the human race in America.".|$|R
500|$|In 272 words, {{and three}} minutes, Lincoln {{asserted}} {{the nation was}} born not in 1789, but in 1776, [...] "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was {{now part of the}} national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end {{as a result of the}} losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that [...] "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.|$|E
500|$|The Senate {{campaign}} {{featured the}} seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, {{the most famous}} political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that [...] "The Slave Power" [...] was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting {{the values of the}} Founding Fathers <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> created equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby {{was past}} his prime. Among the reasons, [...] "making {{spokesman}} commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He {{has evolved into}} a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been". [...] "The Noble Cos," [...] a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, [...] "So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man...

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E

60|$|The {{notion that}} every husbandman {{is to be}} a freeholder, is as Utopian in practice, as it would <b>be</b> to expect <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> {{to be on the same}} level in fortune, condition, {{education}} and habits. As such a state of things as the last never yet did exist, it was probably never designed by divine wisdom that it should exist.

50|$|Winstanley took as {{his basic}} texts the Biblical sacred history, with its {{affirmation}} <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> descended {{from a common}} stock, and with its scepticism about the rulership of kings, voiced in the Books of Samuel; and the New Testament's affirmations that God was no respecter of persons, {{that there were no}} masters or slaves under the New Covenant.

2500|$|Aquinas {{explicitly}} {{rejected the}} notion that slavery is justified by natural law, since he held <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> equal by nature.

Hence he found no natural basis for the enslavement of one person rather than another, [...] "thus removing any possible justification for slavery based on race or religion." [...] Right reason, not coercion, is the moral basis of authority, for [...] "one man is not by nature ordained to another as an end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jefferson Davis defined {{equality}} {{in terms of}} the equal rights of states, and opposed the declaration <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> created equal. Jefferson Davis stated that a [...] "disparaging discrimination" [...] and a fight for [...] "liberty" [...] against [...] "the tyranny of an unbridled majority" [...] gave the Confederate states a right to secede. In 1860, Congressman Laurence M. Keitt of South Carolina said, [...] "The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy.
