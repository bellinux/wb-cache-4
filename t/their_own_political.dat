5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|During presidential elections, {{candidates}} may advertise on the Internet {{except on}} the eve of polling day and polling day itself. However, on those days, it remains legal for people to convey <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> views on a non-commercial basis to others by telephonic or electronic transmission, and election advertising may remain unaltered on the Internet if it was lawfully published before the eve of polling day.|$|E
5|$|In Spain from 1808 to 1814 the Spanish War of Independence {{took place}} amidst a multi-cultural Spain. Spain, at the time, {{was under the}} control of King Joseph, who was Napoleon I of France's brother. Because the nation was {{under the control of}} French rule, the Spanish formed coalitions of ethnic groups to reclaim <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>{{political}}</b> representation, instead of the current French political system in power.|$|E

5|$|In Tamil Nadu, {{partisan}} television channels {{associated with}} the ruling AIADMK and the opposing DMK political parties were criticised for using the disaster for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> purposes. Also, several claimed that the political parties obstructed the flood relief efforts of the volunteers for their own gains. National media outlets were widely criticised on social media for failing to adequately report on the flood crisis. On 2 December, the government Press Information Bureau (PIB) released an edited photo showing the Prime Minister looking down from an aircraft window which was removed after criticism.|$|E

The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused {{to participate in the}} Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E

At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who {{finished}} first and third in the 200metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned her head down {{and to the right}} of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.|$|E

25|$|Some authors, such as Heather Streets, {{argue that}} the {{military}} authorities puffed up {{the images of the}} martial soldiers by writing regimental histories, and by extolling the kilted Scots, kukri-wielding Gurkhas and turbaned Sikhs in numerous paintings. Richard Schultz, an American author, has claimed the martial race concept as a supposedly clever British effort to divide and rule the people of India for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> ends.|$|E

Linguistic effects on Spanish and Portuguese are also marked, such as in terms like pampa, taco, tamale, cacique.|$|E

Canadian federalists, however, accused the government of Quebec of trying to advance <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> agenda.|$|E
25|$|The Vice President {{is elected}} {{in the same}} manner as, but {{separately}} from, the President.

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{heightened}} exposure and popularity of the philosophical schools (haereseis) of Greco-Roman society and education, Synods and Councils were forced to engage such schools that sought to co-opt the language and pretext of the Christian faith {{in order to gain}} power and popularity for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> and cultural expansion. As a result, ecumenical councils were held to attempt to rebuild solidarity by using the strength of distant orthodox witnesses to dampen the intense local effects of particular philosophical schools within a given area.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, romantic {{writers like}} novelist Sir Walter Scott created heroic {{images of the}} crusaders.

When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the New Zealand Government made its own decision to enter the war.|$|E
25|$|In principle, some theorists {{proposed}} Shōwa Restoration, {{the plan}} of giving direct dictatorial powers to the Emperor (due to his divine attributes) for leading the future overseas actions in mainland Asia. This was the purpose behind the February 26 Incident and other similar uprisings in Japan. Later, however, these previously mentioned thinkers decided to organize <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> clique based on previous radical, militaristic movements in the 1930s; this was {{the origin of the}} Kodoha party and their political desire to take direct control of all the political power in the country from the moderate and democratic political voices.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{was careful}} and {{cautious}} in his behaviour. Whenever policy changes were announced, if {{he played a}} role in lobbying for those changes, he would keep quiet about his involvement. Xun Liang (荀良), one of his younger relatives, advised him to let others know the good deeds he did so that he would gain greater respect. Wu Tong (武統), his son-in-law, also urged him to attract people to support him. However, Xun Xu refused to listen to them and he warned his sons against forming <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>political</b> clouts and forgetting their place as subjects of the emperor. Later, Emperor Wu promoted Xun Xu to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|E
