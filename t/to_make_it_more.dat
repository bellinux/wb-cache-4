The interface of the autopilot used on airliners was redesigned <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> ergonomic.

5|$|At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers {{agreed to}} create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations.

5|$|In 1992, the Albert Bridge was rewired {{and painted}} {{in an unusual}} colour scheme {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> conspicuous in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships.

5|$|President Reagan {{announced}} on September 16, 1983, that the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{would be made}} available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in the future.

5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> energy-efficient.|$|E

5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> suitable as a family film. By {{the time it was}} completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> accessible and attractive to the masses. The Church hierarchy {{went along with the}} notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} shot through special lenses <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> {{reminiscent}} of the decade. At Peter's funeral, actress Blair Brown wanted her character Nina Sharp to wear sunglasses, because she thought Nina would not share her emotions at the funeral. Unlike Noble, Brown wore a wig. The scenes at Reiden Lake were actually shot on a parking lot, and the crew placed a covering over it to simulate the cracks normally on a lake.|$|E

5|$|The main {{building}} was begun in 1772, {{as a free}} hospital for the poor, but funding ran out two years later, and it was completed as a private residence. In the early 19th century, it was bought {{by a group of}} Franciscan nuns, who moved from an unsatisfactory site in Winchester. The nuns carried out a number of additions and extensions to the building <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> suitable for their needs. They moved out of Taunton in 1950 and sold the convent to the Sisters of St. Joseph, who continued to run a school on the site for the next twenty-six years.|$|E
5|$|The series won several {{international}} advertising {{awards for}} BBH. The brand's creaminess was emphasised through {{items such as}} face cream, ice cream, sun cream and whipped cream. Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: We were thinking how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into something more stylish, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> appealing again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream.

5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E
