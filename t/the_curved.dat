5|$|After flowering, <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards {{on wooden}} stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
50|$|Determine the {{symmetry}} of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> If <b>the</b> exponent of x is always {{even in the}} equation of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> then <b>the</b> y-axis is an axis of symmetry for <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Similarly, if <b>the</b> exponent of y is always even in the equation of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> then <b>the</b> x-axis is an axis of symmetry for <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> If <b>the</b> sum of the degrees of x and y in each term is always even or always odd, then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is symmetric about the origin and the origin is called a center of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|R

50|$|Given b<a+c, {{the shape}} of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is {{determined}} by the relative magnitude of b and d. If d is imaginary, that is if a2+b2 <c2 then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has <b>the</b> form of a figure eight. If d is 0 then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is a figure eight with two branches of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> having a common horizontal tangent at the origin. If 0<d<b then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has two additional double points at ±d and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> crosses itself at these points. The overall shape of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is pretzel-like in this case. If d=b then a=c and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> decomposes into a circle of radius b and a lemniscate of Booth, a figure eight shaped curve. A special case of this is a=c, b=√2c which produces the lemniscate of Bernoulli. Finally, if d>b then the points ±d are still solutions to the Cartesian equation of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> does not cross these points and they are acnodes. <b>The</b> <b>curve</b> again has a figure eight shape though the shape is distorted if d is close to b.|$|R
5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor.

5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurus is {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} herbivorous dinosaur. In 1974, Thulborn proposed that the tusks of the dinosaur played no important role in feeding; rather, {{that they would have}} been used in combat with conspecifics, for display, as a visual threat, or for active defence. Similar functions are seen in the enlarged tusks of modern muntjacs and chevrotains, but <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> tusks of warthogs (used for digging) are dissimilar.|$|E

50|$|For smooth or {{polygonal}} <b>curves,</b> <b>the</b> Jordan <b>curve</b> theorem can {{be proved}} in a straightforward way. Indeed <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has a tubular neighbourhood, {{defined in the}} smooth case by the field of unit normal vectors to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> or in <b>the</b> polygonal case by points {{at a distance of}} less than ε from the curve.In a neighbourhood of a differentiable point on <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> there is a coordinate change in which <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> becomes <b>the</b> diameter of an open disk. Taking a point not on <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> a straight line aimed at <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> starting at <b>the</b> point will eventually meet the tubular neighborhood; the path can be continued next to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> until it meets the disk. It will meet it on one side or the other. This proves that the complement of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has at most two connected components. On the other hand using the Cauchy integral formula for the winding number, {{it can be seen that}} the winding number is constant on connected components of the complement of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> is zero near infinity and increases by 1 when crossing <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Hence <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has exactly two components, its interior and the unbounded component. The same argument works for a piecewise differentiable Jordan curve.|$|R
5|$|Located to {{the east}} of the Nanzan Campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel (1962). This is a {{building}} that exploits the plastic capacity of concrete, with two intersecting shells forming a bell tower.

5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is ribbed and riveted {{in the shape of}} sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} is to show that a dense set of points on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> are {{accessible}} from the inside of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> i.e. they are {{at the end of a}} line segment lying entirely in the interior of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> In fact, a given point on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is arbitrarily close to some point in the interior and there is a smallest closed disk about that point which intersects <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> only on it boundary; those boundary points are close to the original point on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> and by construction are accessible.|$|R

5|$|The {{zoning plan}} for the station was passed in 1998 and demands for {{accessibility}} were laid down in 2003, causing a contrast between these goals and <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> platforms. This would particularly be a challenge for the Class 70 trains, which would have a wide gap. Part of the dispute centered on the Vollsveien Bridge, {{whether or not it}} had a heritage status and whether or not its demolition would allow for a straight station. Minister of Transport and Communication Torild Skogsholm stated that she laid the blame on director of the National Rail Administration, Steinar Killi. Her successor, Liv Signe Navarsete, announced in July 2006 that the construction would continue following <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> design, though minor functional changes would be made.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> platform and featured a gable.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in {{the lower half of}} the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> horizon.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, {{the center}} of {{curvature}} of a curve is found at a point that is {{at a distance from}} <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> equal to <b>the</b> radius of curvature lying on the normal vector. It is the point at infinity if the curvature is zero. The osculating circle to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is centered at the centre of curvature. Cauchy defined {{the center of}} curvature C as the intersection point of two infinitely close normal lines to <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> <b>The</b> locus of centers of curvature for each point on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> comprise <b>the</b> evolute of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{can be seen}} in {{the figure}} to the right: <b>the</b> blue <b>curve</b> is <b>the</b> evolute of all <b>the</b> other <b>curves.</b> <b>The</b> cusp in <b>the</b> blue <b>curve</b> {{corresponds}} to a vertex in <b>the</b> other <b>curves.</b> <b>The</b> cusps in <b>the</b> green <b>curve</b> are on <b>the</b> evolute. <b>Curves</b> with <b>the</b> same evolute are parallel.|$|R
5000|$|In geometry, an {{intrinsic}} equation of a curve is an equation that defines <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> using a relation between <b>the</b> <b>curve's</b> intrinsic properties, that is, properties {{that do not}} depend on the location and possibly the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Therefore {{an intrinsic}} equation defines the shape of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> without specifying its position relative to an arbitrarily defined coordinate system.|$|R
5|$|Both {{the north}} tower and the south tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a {{resemblance}} to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a building of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the South Tower facing southeast, northeast, and northwest have a linear glass curtainwall. The North Tower has a similar design, except it is shorter and <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> aluminum and glass side faces northeast. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E

5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E
