5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} Olympic {{skeleton}} event was won by American sledder Jennison Heaton, who also won {{a silver medal}} in the bobsleigh's five-man event. His younger brother, John Heaton, was runner-up, spending an additional second to complete all <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> (the fourth was cancelled). He repeated this result 20 years later, placing behind Nino Bibbia of Italy, who won his country's first Winter Olympic gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored <b>three</b> <b>runs,</b> had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E
5|$|After <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> {{over the}} city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
50|$|On April 26, Stanton hit a <b>three</b> <b>run</b> {{home run}} off of Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. It {{was the first}} <b>three</b> <b>run</b> homer Kershaw had allowed in 844 innings. From July 5-6, Stanton hit four home runs in four {{consecutive}} at-bats at Citi Field.|$|R

5|$|Colorado {{departed}} Tokyo Bay on 20 September 1945 for San Francisco. She {{arrived there}} on 15 October, and then sailed for Seattle for Navy Day (27 October). She {{was part of}} the Operation Magic Carpet force, making <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> to Pearl Harbor to transport 6357 soldiers home, before returning to Bremerton Navy Yard for her deactivation. She was placed out of reserve commission on 7 January 1947 and was sold for scrap on 23 July 1959.|$|E
5|$|Doug made a {{start in}} Game 4 of the 2013 ALDS against the Oakland Athletics, with the Tigers facing elimination. He gave up <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> and seven hits in six innings of work. The Tigers {{won the game}} with a late rally, so Fister did not factor in the decision. In Game 4 of the 2013 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, Fister gave up just one run on eight hits, {{striking}} out seven over six innings and earning the win in a 7-3 Tigers victory.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.|$|E

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on {{for five minutes}} on the final morning, adding <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller. This would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia’s batsmen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, the Dodgers scored <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> off Maglie. Reese and Snider hit {{back-to-back}} singles, and Maglie threw a wild pitch, allowing Reese to score. After Robinson was walked, Andy Pafko hit {{a single}} to score Snider. Cox added another single to score Robinson before the inning ended, making the score 4–1 in favor of the Dodgers. Newcombe got the Giants out in order {{in the bottom of the}} eighth, and Larry Jansen did the same in relief of Maglie in {{the top of the}} ninth.|$|E

5|$|On 16 December 2006, {{during the}} Third Ashes Test at the WACA, Gilchrist scored a century in 57 balls, {{including}} twelve fours and four sixes, the second fastest recorded Test century. At 97 runs from 54 balls, Gilchrist needed <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> {{from the next}} delivery to better Viv Richards' record set in 1986. The ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard was wide and Gilchrist was unable to score from it.|$|E
5|$|She then {{played in}} the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams, {{and was the first}} match to be shown live on free-to-air {{television}} in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler Ellyse Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first ball of the match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it. Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar's off spin. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 {{at the end of the}} 19th over and had scored <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final ball of the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was chosen}} to pitch for Puerto Rico in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He made two starts in the Classic. He won the first one on March 11 by {{pitching}} four scoreless innings in a 5–0 victory over the Netherlands. Although he only pitched 2 innings and gave up <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> in his next start against the United States, he was {{in line for the}} win going into the ninth inning. However, J. C. Romero and Fernando Cabrera blew the lead, and the United States knocked Puerto Rico out of the Classic with a 6–5 victory.|$|E

In 28 at-bats during the Series, Smith scored <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> and had two RBIs. Smith finished second in MVP balloting to Andre Dawson, who had played on the last-place Chicago Cubs, largely because Smith and teammate Jack Clark split the first-place vote. Following the 1987 season, Smith was awarded the largest contract in the National League at $2,340,000.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out {{with two outs}} in the ninth was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being thrown. The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would rally to score <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> and win on a Mattingly single.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Americans {{played the}} Pittsburgh Pirates {{in the first}} modern World Series in 1903. Young, who started Game One against the visiting Pirates, thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history. The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning, and Young lost the game. Young {{performed}} better in subsequent games, winning his next two starts. He also drove in <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> in Game Five. Young finished the series with a 21 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals scored one run in {{both the}} second and third innings on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mike Matheny to score Jim Edmonds and a home run to right field by Walker, respectively. However, {{in the bottom of the}} third, the Red Sox scored <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> after seven consecutive batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren came in from the Cardinals' bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with two four-game home series, against the Marlins and Braves. In their first {{game against the}} Marlins, a 4–0 loss, they had six hits.

In the third game, Domonic Brown failed to catch a fly ball to left field; <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> scored in a 3–2 loss. The Phillies won the series' final game, 5–3, with a 14th-inning walk-off home run by Chase Utley. After the game, Carlos Ruiz {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with to a concussion sustained in the 11th inning. After the Phillies swept the Braves earlier in the month, the Braves returned the favor in the month's final series for both teams. In game one Kendrick returned to his old ways, allowing <b>three</b> <b>runs</b> in the first inning of a 4–2 loss. The next day, June 28, featured a day-night doubleheader. Hernandez started the afternoon game; two errors and six runs allowed by the bullpen led to a 10–3 loss. In the night game, the Phillies called up Sean O'Sullivan for his season debut and lost 5–1. After this game (the 81st of the 162-game season), the Phillies had a 36–45 record before losing the series' final game 3–2.|$|E
