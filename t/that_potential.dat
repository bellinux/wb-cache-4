40|$|It {{is shown}} <b>that</b> {{electromagnetic}} <b>potentials</b> convey physical information beyond that supplied by electric and magnetic fields alone, {{and are thus}} more fundamental. Observable physical properties can impose conditions on the selection of electromagnetic gauge (i. e. sets of <b>potentials)</b> <b>that</b> are explicit and restrictive. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. The implication that the choice of gauge carries physical information is confirmed by exhibiting a set of <b>potentials</b> <b>that</b> describes fields correctly, but that violates physical constraints. The basic conclusions are that physical requirements place limits on acceptable gauges; and <b>that</b> <b>potentials</b> are more fundamental than fields in both classical and quantum physics, representing a major generalization of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect. These important properties are obscured if the dipole approximation is employed. The properties demonstrated here relate directly to conditions that exist in strong-field laser applications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTooth {{development}} in urodele amphibians occurs from a restricted region of anterior cranial neural crest. Anin vitroculture system {{was used to}} test the odontogenic potential of more caudal regions of neural crest, including an “intermediate region” of neural folds which has never previously been tested for either fate or potential. Explants of different axial levels of neural crest with stomodaeal ectoderm and endoderm demonstrated <b>that</b> odontogenic <b>potential</b> extends not only further caudally than the axial level fated to produce teeth, but also beyond <b>that</b> with <b>potential</b> to produce cartilage. Our results show <b>that</b> chondrogenic <b>potential</b> is found only within the most rostral portion of the intermediate region, but <b>that</b> odontogenic <b>potential</b> extends to its most caudal limit. This separation of skeletogenic cell lineages in the neural crest necessitates a reevaluation of the designations of “cranial” and “trunk” and a reconsideration of the evolutionary implications of developmentally distinct crest-derived mesenchyme populations. The proposal <b>that</b> odontogenic <b>potential</b> extends into the trunk neural crest may be explained as conserved from a phylogenetically older, more extensive skeletogenic ability which produced the exoskeleton of more basal vertebrates...|$|R
