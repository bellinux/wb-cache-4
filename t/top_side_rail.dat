40|$|Railway rails work {{in contact}} with railway vehicle wheels. During this contact high surface contact {{stresses}} anddifferent sliding speeds occur between wheel-rail pair. Stress values that occur on <b>top</b> and <b>side</b> of <b>rail</b> geometryare different. This situation causes wear and damage onrail material in time. In this study primarily the rail material that is used in ourcountry was characterized. Wear experiments areconducted in dry and wet conditions, different contactstresses and sliding speeds in order to sample rail-wheelcontact. All wear tests were performed according to DIN 50324 standard with WC ball as counter object in a ball ondisc geometry. Wear surfaces were characterized byoptically, SEM microstructure analysis and EDS analysis,friction coefficients and wear rates were calculated forevery test condition. As a result damage that occurs on railmaterial during working conditions were tried to bedetermined...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} use of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> {{within the context of}} {{physical}} restraint in gerontological practice. It is debated that <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> can be considered as a form of physical restraint if the individual cannot voluntarily remove/lower the device if he/she wishes to do so. The value of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> as a protective medium is debated with regard to their association with injuries sustained as a result. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> should be used with caution and within a risk management context. Frailty should not be an indicator for {{the use of}} <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> an individualized approach to determine patient's suitability to <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> is advocated...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of an {{advanced}} practice nurse (APN) intervention on restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> usage in four nursing homes and with a sample of 251 residents. A secondary question explored the association between restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> reduction and bed-related falls. DESIGN : Pre- and posttest design. SETTING : Four urban nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS : All nursing home residents present in the nursing home at three time points (n= 710, 719, and 707) and a subset of residents (n= 251) with restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use at baseline. INTERVENTION : APN consultation with individual residents and facility-wide education and consultation. MEASUREMENTS : Direct observation of <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> status, resident and nurse interview for functional status, mobility, cognition, behavioral symptoms, medical record review for demographics and treatment information, and incident reports for fall data. RESULTS : At the institutional level, one of the four nursing homes significantly reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use (P =. 01). At the individual participant level, 51. 4 % (n= 130) reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use. For the group that reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> there was a significantly (P <. 001) reduced fall rate (− 0. 053; 95 % confidence interval (CI) =− 0. 083 to − 0. 024), whereas the group that continued restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> did not demonstrate a significantly (P =. 17) reduced fall rate (− 0. 013; 95 % CI=− 0. 056 – 0. 030). CONCLUSION : An APN consultation model can safely reduce <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use. Restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> reduction does not lead to an increase in bed-related falls. Although <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> serve many purposes, routine use of these devices to restrict voluntary movement and prevent falls is not supported...|$|R

40|$|To {{explore the}} safety of the {{standard}} and the low hospital bed, we report on a microanalysis of 15 patients’ ability to ingress, move about the bed, and egress. The 15 participants were purposefully selected with various disabilities. Bed conditions were randomized with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> up or down and one low bed with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> down. We explored the patients’ use of the <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> bed height, ability to lift their legs onto the mattress, and ability to turn, egress, and walk back to the chair. The standard bed was too high for some participants, both for ingress and egress. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> were used by most participants when entering, turning in bed, and exiting. We recommend that <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> be reconsidered as a means to facilitate in-bed movement, ingress, and egress. Furthermore, single deck height settings for all patients are not optimal.

40|$|Background: The use of {{hospital}} bed <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> for increased mobility and safety for elderly and high fall risk patients {{has become a}} controversial topic. The suggested removal of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> to prevent entrapment, as recommended by Consumer Federation of America, increases the risk that a patient may {{fall out of the}} bed. Additionally, without <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> patients may require additional assistance from nurses to reposition patients in bed, which increases the risk of back injuries among nurses (Jang et al. 2007). Objective: To examine the biomechanics associated with a patient’s ability to move freely in bed with and without <b>side</b> <b>rails.</b> Methods: Biomechanical data for in bed movements from fifty-two older adults with a history of falls (Morse Fall Scale value> 45) (mean age= 68 years, SD= 11. 4) was analyzed. An 18 -camera motion tracking system (NaturalPoint, Corvallis, OR) was used to track body biomechanics. Participants were instructed to lie down on an instrumented hospital bed. They were then instructed to turn onto their right side, then onto their left side. This was performed three times with three different <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> configurations; rail 1, rail 2 and no rails.
