5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> route.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, {{silver dollar}} {{production}} was temporarily restarted to supply a diplomatic mission to Asia {{with a special}} set of proof coins. Officials mistakenly believed that dollars had last been minted with the date 1804, prompting them <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> date rather than the date in which the coins were actually struck. A limited number of 1804 dollars were struck by the Mint in later years, and they remain rare and valuable.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And so we wanted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon {{spent a couple of}} hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

5|$|With the {{construction}} of a new bridge across the Saginaw River in 1941 to connect Lafayette and Salzburg avenues, US23 was rerouted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> new bridge. The former routing of the mainline highway through downtown was redesignated Bus. US23 at that time. Twenty years later, with the opening of the new freeway for Interstate 75 (I-75) near Bay City, US23 was rerouted to follow I-75. The route of Bus. US23 was redesignated as a part of Business Loop I-75 at this time.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} to Cam Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would go down {{as one of the}} greatest failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not expect them <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> road due to its poor condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

25|$|The {{change of}} command in the Army of Tennessee {{did not go}} unnoticed by Sherman. His subordinates, James B. McPherson and John M.

25|$|St Luke's Park was {{the home}} ground of the Western Suburbs club in 1910 and 1911. They started playing their matches at Pratten Park in Ashfield in 1912, but after {{pressure}} from local residents there the council refused the club permission <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> ground, forcing them to return to St. Luke's Oval from 1915 to 1919.|$|E
25|$|Backmasking {{has been}} used as a {{recording}} technique since the 1960s. In the era of magnetic tape sound recording, backmasking required that the source reel-to-reel tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). Digital audio recording has greatly simplified the process.|$|E

The brigade {{was composed of}} Regular battalions from Southern England that had formed part of the garrison of Malta all through the siege of 1940–42.

Now they were <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> experience to spearhead the assault landings on D-Day.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} of a language that talks about those things that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E
25|$|The manager could, if he wished, {{attempt to}} start a rival bank, {{but he could not}} legally claim {{to be part of the}} Medici Bank, since a right <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> trademarked name came with the partnership. This measure would turn out to be {{effective}} against ambitious dissident juniors like Tommaso Portinari. However, even before the shares' profits were paid out, any sums invested in the branch outside of an ownership of shares were repaid at a set interest rate, sometimes leading to one branch paying another for the latter's investment in the former.|$|E
