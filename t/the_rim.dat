5|$|Atmospheric instability, hot temperatures, and {{a severe}} drought fueled the fire, making it {{difficult}} to suppress. On Thursday, October 24, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire was 100% contained.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. <b>The</b> <b>rim</b> is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|Front flat tire. Braking a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause the tire to come off <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of}} a front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|E
5000|$|The crater Walther is {{attached}} to the remnant of <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim,</b> and Ball intrudes into <b>the</b> southwestern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> crater remnant Lexell has broken across <b>the</b> southeastern <b>rim,</b> forming a [...] "harbor" [...] in the crater floor due to the wide gap in its northern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> irregular crater Regiomontanus {{is attached}} to <b>the</b> northeast <b>rim</b> of Deslandres. <b>The</b> crater Hell lies entirely within <b>the</b> western <b>rim.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{ceramic coating}} for <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> is {{available}} which may reduce wear {{and can also}} improve both wet and dry braking. It may also slightly reduce heat transfer {{to the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> because it is a thermal insulator.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{surviving}} <b>rim</b> of Perrine is {{worn and}} eroded, with the overlapping pair Perrine E and Perrine G intruding slightly into <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim.</b> A smaller crater has disrupted the southwest end of <b>the</b> outer <b>rim,</b> {{and a pair}} of small craters are attached to <b>the</b> northern <b>rim.</b>|$|R
5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} inside <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the bell, squeeze {{water out}} of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|Most notable was {{the closure}} of the Monitor Ridge trail, which {{previously}} let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers. In February 2010, a climber died after falling from <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> into the crater.|$|E
5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. <b>The</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor of}} this crater {{has been completely}} resurfaced by lava that has entered through a break in <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> surviving <b>rim</b> forms a shallow, arcing ridge about the interior. A small flooded crater lies across <b>the</b> southeast <b>rim,</b> and <b>the</b> remains of a small crater form an incision along <b>the</b> northeastern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> interior floor has the same low albedo as the lunar mare to the east, and is marked only by a few small craterlets.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the crater}} {{is a small}} central mountain. Touching <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>rim</b> are two smaller craters, one in the southwest and a smaller one to the south another one is in <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim.</b> Near <b>the</b> southern <b>rim</b> has a hilly terrain. Touching <b>the</b> northeastern <b>rim</b> predominantly is Oceanidum Fossa east of that is Doanus Vallis.|$|R
50|$|Oak Creek Canyon {{is about}} 12 mi long, ranging in width from 0.8 to 2.5 mi. The {{depth of the}} canyon ranges from 800 to 2000 ft. However, due to the {{faulting}} that {{played a major role}} in its formation, <b>the</b> west <b>rim</b> of <b>the</b> canyon is 700 ft higher than <b>the</b> east <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> average elevation of <b>the</b> west <b>rim</b> is 7200 ft while <b>the</b> east <b>rim</b> elevation is 6500 ft.|$|R
5|$|The RA {{does not}} extend from below the {{backboard}} to the baseline. Therefore, if a player drives the baseline and is not attempting to go directly to <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> the RA does not apply.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary {{noted that}} no other firm had complained, that the Hobbs {{mechanism}} had not been widely sold, and that the changes demanded—a clear space around <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> and the flattening of the Indian's cheekbone—would affect the artistic merit of the piece.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{eruption}} was in March 1944. It destroyed {{the villages of}} San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, Massa di Somma, Ottaviano, and part of San Giorgio a Cremano. From March 18 to 23, 1944, lava flows appeared within <b>the</b> <b>rim.</b> There were outflows. Small explosions then occurred until the major explosion took place on March 18, 1944.|$|E
50|$|The crater Boyle {{is nearly}} {{attached}} to <b>the</b> northeastern <b>rim</b> of Hess, and Abbe lies to the south. To {{the west is}} the large walled plain Poincaré, and Hess {{is located at the}} eastern edge of the crater's deeply eroded outer <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> satellite crater Hess Z is partly overlaid by <b>the</b> northern <b>rim</b> of Hess. <b>The</b> small crater Hess M joins <b>the</b> south-southwest <b>rim</b> of Hess to <b>the</b> northwest <b>rim</b> of Abbe.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> outer <b>rim</b> of Jules Verne is {{worn and}} eroded, with several craters lying across the edge. Along {{the eastern edge}} lies Jules Verne G, while Jules Verne C penetrates <b>the</b> northeastern <b>rim</b> and Jules Verne Z cuts across <b>the</b> {{northern}} <b>rim.</b> A small crater also lies across <b>the</b> southern <b>rim,</b> while Jules Verne P {{is attached to the}} exterior along the south-southwest.|$|R
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. <b>The</b> <b>rim</b> is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> and it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E
5|$|Throne of Fire is {{an action}} {{strategy}} video game. It {{was designed by}} Mike Singleton, developed by Consult Computer Systems, and published by Melbourne House. The game was released for the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1987. Throne of Fire {{is set in the}} Burning Citadel, located around <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of a volcano.|$|E
5|$|Various {{forms of}} oval short-track racing, {{including}} F1 and F2 stock cars, {{have taken place}} at Mendips Raceway since 1969. The track is located on Warrens Hill Road, on <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Batts Combe quarry between Shipham and Charterhouse.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a crater}} {{that has been}} nearly obliterated by a history of impacts, leaving only a {{disintegrated}} remnant of <b>the</b> original <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> surviving outer <b>rim</b> is not especially circular, having been reshaped into a somewhat pentagonal outline. There are deep gouges from cratering along <b>the</b> northeastern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> interior floor is not in much better shape, being rough and irregular.|$|R
50|$|This crater is of {{the type}} {{traditionally}} termed a walled plain. It has a heavily eroded outer rim that is overlain by several smaller craters. Among these are Wilhelm A and Wilhelm K across <b>the</b> southwest <b>rim,</b> and Wilhelm B just to the northwest along <b>the</b> western <b>rim.</b> Wilhelm C intrudes into <b>the</b> north-northeast <b>rim,</b> and Wilhelm D is attached to <b>the</b> northeast outer <b>rim.</b> There is an outward protrusion in <b>the</b> southern <b>rim</b> that extends to contact Montanari.|$|R
50|$|When {{placed in}} <b>the</b> mouth, wax <b>rims</b> allow <b>the</b> dentist {{to record a}} {{measured}} vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) because the patient {{will be unable to}} close further than the wax will allow. The wax is built up or removed until the appropriate VDO has been established. <b>The</b> <b>rims</b> are then notched in order to allow an index of the relationship of <b>the</b> maxillary <b>rim</b> to <b>the</b> mandibular <b>rim</b> with an impressionable medium, such as Alluwax or Regisal.|$|R
5|$|As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value. However, some date and mint mark varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known {{variety of the}} 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> commands a higher price than the regular issue.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Mount Pleasant Road {{existed between}} St. Clair Avenue and Blythwood Road, ending at <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the Blythwood Ravine. Despite this, the road on the {{opposite}} rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920. Following {{the construction of the}} Vale of Avoca {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> South <b>Rim</b> is more {{accessible}} than the North Rim; most {{visitors to the}} park come to <b>the</b> South <b>Rim,</b> arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance. Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and <b>the</b> North <b>Rim</b> to <b>the</b> South <b>Rim.</b> Overall, some 30 miles of <b>the</b> South <b>Rim</b> are accessible by road.|$|R
50|$|This feature {{has been}} heavily damaged by {{overlapping}} impacts, leaving it scarcely distinguishable from the irregular lunar terrain. The satellite crater Koval'skiy P lies across <b>the</b> southwestern <b>rim,</b> and Koval'skiy B intrudes into <b>the</b> northeastern <b>rim.</b> A small crater also lies across <b>the</b> northwestern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> interior is irregular and marked by several small craterlets.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rims</b> of <b>the</b> ears {{sometimes}} {{need special}} attention {{as they can}} become dry and cracked.|$|R
5|$|Forest fires {{seasonally}} {{clear the}} park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income generated by tourism. The Summer of Fire saw more resources {{dedicated to the}} subject of wildfire than ever before or since in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of the park to tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{returned}} to the United States via Diego Garcia, Australia, and Hawaii in early 1988. Several months later, Missouris crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> of the Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included Vancouver and Victoria in Canada, San Diego, Seattle, and Bremerton.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has named}} <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E
