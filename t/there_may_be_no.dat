5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the {{well with the}} south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are particularly evident {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> roads at all. One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|E

25|$|The energy {{states of}} any {{quantized}} field {{are defined by}} the Hamiltonian, based on local conditions, including the time coordinate.

25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of helminthiasis depend on a number of factors including: the site of the infestation within the body; the type of worm involved; the number of worms and their volume; the type of damage the infesting worms cause; and, the immunological response of the body. Where the burden of parasites in the body is light, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed {{number of}} {{responses}} have been emitted since the previous reinforcement.

25|$|Most {{denominations}} make {{no effort}} {{at all to}} maintain a national membership database and must rely on local churches or surveys of the general population. Local church membership rolls are often maintained poorly because <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> need for an official membership list (Bahá'ís at least must maintain accurate voting lists) and local congregations sometimes do not provide their denomination's membership data even when asked.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's thyroiditis, {{also known}} as chronic {{lymphocytic}} thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goiter. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma.|$|E
