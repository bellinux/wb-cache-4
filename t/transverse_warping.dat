40|$|We put the 25 April 2015 {{earthquake}} of Nepal (Mw 7. 9) {{into its}} structural geological context {{in order to}} specify {{the role of the}} segmentation of the Himalayan megathrust. The rupture is mainly located NW of Kathmandu, at a depth of 13 - 15 km on a flat portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) that dips towards the N-NE by 7 - 10 degrees. The northern bound of the main rupture corresponds to the transition towards a steeper crustal ramp. This ramp, which is partly coupled during the interseismic period, is only locally affected by the earthquake. The southern bound of the rupture was near {{the leading edge of the}} Lesser Himalaya antiformal duplex and near the frontal footwall ramp of the upper Nawakot duplex. The rupture has been affected by transversal structures: on the western side, the Judi lineament separates the main rupture zone from the nucleation area; on the eastern side, the Gaurishankar lineament separates the 25 April 2015 rupture from the 12 May 2015 (Mw 7. 2) rupture. The origin of these lineaments is very complex: they are probably linked to pre-Himalayan faults that extend into the Indian shield beneath the MHT. These inheritedtaults induce <b>transverse</b> <b>warping</b> of the upper lithosphere beneath the MHT, control the location of lateral ramps of the thrust system and concentrate the hanging wall deformation at the lateral edge of the ruptures. The MHT is therefore segmented by stable barriers that define at least five patches in Central Nepal. These barriers influence the extent of the earthquake ruptures. For the last two centuries: the 1833 (Mw 7. 6) earthquake was rather similar in extent to the 2015 event but its rupture propagated south-westwards from an epicentre located NE of Kathmandu; the patch south of Kathmandu was probably affected by at least three earthquakes of Mw 7 that followed the 1833 event a few days later or 33 years (1866 event, Mw 7. 2) later; the 1934 earthquake (Mw 8. 4) had an epicentre similar to 170 km east of Kathmandu, may have propagated as far as Kathmandu and jumped the Gaurishankar lineament. This combined structural approach and earthquake study allows us to propose that the MHT in the central/eastern Himalaya is segmented by stable barriers that define barrier-type earthquake families. However for each individual earthquake within a family, the rupture histories could be different. Furthermore, the greatest earthquakes could have broken the barriers and affected the patches of several families. The concept of a regular recurrence of characteristic earthquakes is therefore misleading to describe the succession of Himalayan earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|A {{multilayered}} plate theory {{which uses}} <b>transverse</b> shear <b>warping</b> functions issued from three-dimensional elasticity is presented. Two methods to obtain these <b>transverse</b> shear <b>warping</b> functions are detailed. The warping functions are issued from the variations of transverse shear stresses computed at special location points for a simply supported bending problem. The first method considers an exact 3 D {{solution of the}} problem. The second method uses the solution provided by the model itself: the transverse shear stresses are computed by the integration of equilibrium equations. Hence, an iterative process is applied, the model being updated with the new warping functions, and so on. These two models are compared to other models and to analytical solutions for the bending of simply supported plates. Four different laminates and a sandwich are considered, length-to-thickness values varying from 2 to 100. An additional analytical solution that simulates the behavior of laminates under the plane stress hypothesis - which is retained by all presented models - shows that the iterative model almost gives the exact solution for all laminates and all length-to-thickness ratio values...|$|R

The local warping degrees of freedom are computed along with the global beam degrees of freedom by satisfying the structure equilibrium. In the case of pure torsion, {{the evolution of the}} warping shape only depends on the concrete damage state. The comparison of numerical and experimental torque-twist curves ascertains the importance of including torsional warping in the formulation.

The structural model incorporates {{a number of}} non-classical effects, such as <b>transverse</b> shear, <b>warping</b> inhibition, non-uniform torsional model, and rotary inertia. The results obtained in this article seek to clarify the effect of flapâ€“twist coupling, taper ratio, slenderness ratio, angular velocity, fibre orientation, and hub ratio on natural frequencies and mode shapes of the rotating thin-walled composite beams. The results are expected to offer better predictions of the vibrational behaviour {{of these kinds of}} structures in general, and in the design of rotor blades of turbo machinery, in particular...|$|R

The main object {{of this study is to}} show the applicability of the concept of the initial stresses to the stability problems of the beams. By using exact initial stresses, including the <b>transverse</b> and <b>warping</b> shearing stresses, it is possible to derived mathematically the general stability {{differential equations}} and the correspoding boundary conditions.

40|$|A closed-form {{solution}} for the thermoaeroelastic response of an aircraft swept wing made of advanced composite materials and exposed to a thermal impact generated by a laser beam is presented. For the aircraft wing, an advanced one-dimensional structural model that includes a number of nonclassical effects, such as <b>transverse</b> shear, <b>warping</b> inhibition, and thermoelastic anisotropy of constituent materials, is developed. It is supposed that the wing is immersed in an incompressible flowfield whose speed is below the flutter critical speed of the system. The solution of {{the problem has been}} obtained analytically in the space-time Laplace transform domain. Within this approach, the problem is reduced to the solution of an algebraic equation system in the transformed kinematical unknowns that is afterward inverted in the physical space. Although confined to the dynamic aeroelastic response, the approach of the dynamic response can provide important information on the conditions yielding the occurrence of the flutter instability...|$|R

In this paper, two simplified unit cells for in-plane impregnation in multi-layer woven fabrics (MWFs) have been suggested.

The flow fronts and void formation in these two cells were also numerically simulated using control-volume method.

40|$|The Virtual National Laboratory for Heavy-Ion Fusion Science is {{developing}} a physics design for NDCX-II, an experiment to study warm dense matter heated by ions. Present plans call for using 34 induction cells to accelerate 45 nC of Li+ ions to more than 3 MeV, followed by neutralized drift-compression. To heat targets to the desired temperatures, the beam must be compressed to a millimeter-scale radius and a duration of about 1 ns. A novel NDCX-II acceleration schedule has been developed using an interactive one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation ASP to model the longitudinal physics and axisymmetric WARP simulations to validate the 1 -D model and add <b>transverse</b> focusing. Three-dimensional <b>Warp</b> runs have been used recently to study the sensitivity to misalignments in the focusing solenoids...|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} {{based on}} a variational procedure is presented {{for the assessment of}} the deformation of circular pipes subjected to radial loads along the surface or prescribed distortion along the edge. The transverse section deformation is approached with Fourier expansions, while for each trigonometric term an optimized x-variable function for the ovalization and <b>transverse</b> section <b>warping</b> is defined. To define a reliable and robust formulated solution, an adequate and realistic strain field was considered. This is based on the assumptions of the thin shell theory, where the shell radius is much larger than its thickness, and so allowing the definition of strains at the outer or inner shell surface simply identified by the addition of terms contributing with the thickness parameter, not changing the mean radius. The process of structural optimization is achieved solving a set of differential equations obtained after minimizing the shell strain energy, consequently allowing that the most accurate functions related to the displacement field are obtained. An analytic function is evaluated for the solution problem, including the determination of particular solutions when the system is non-homogeneous when surface loads are included. Examples with a radial load F imposed {{on the surface of the}} pipe or prescribed distortions will be analysed...|$|R
40|$|In {{composite}} plate structures, {{it is common}} to combine different materials with very different Young's moduli and densities. Damping treatments can also be added to prevent high levels of vibration. For discretized problems, the static and dynamic behavior of such heterogeneous structures can be carried out with the 3 D elasticity theory but this often leads to very large systems. Therefore, plate theories and particularly equivalent single layer models are often preferred. Classical plate theories have then been adapted to these particular structures using shear correction factors. Higher order shear deformation theories, and more recently <b>transverse</b> shear <b>warping</b> functions, have been proposed. In this work, a model, in which the shear variations through the thickness are described by means of warping functions, is presented. It can handle warping functions proposed by different authors and also the classical theories (Love-Kirchhoff, Mindlin-Reissner and Reddy). To illustrate the behavior of these theories, two studies are presented: - A sandwich structure with a varying young modulus ratio between the layers is studied using Navier's procedure. Static deflection, shear stress variation through the thickness, and natural frequencies are presented. - A {{composite plate}} covered over 40 % of its surface with a constrained layer damping patch is studied. Mean square velocity is computed and compared over a frequency range. Results are also compared with 3 D finite element computations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the free vibration, dynamic response, and the active control of composite rotating pretwisted blades modeled as nonuniform thin-walled beams, fixed at the hub at a setting angle, and incorporating piezoelectrically induced damping capabilities. In this sense, a distributed piezoelectric actuator system activated {{through the application}} of an out-of-phase electrical current is used to suppress the dynamic response of the rotating beam subjected to a Heaviside pulse. The blade model incorporates nonclassical effects such as <b>transverse</b> shear, secondary <b>warping,</b> and rotary inertias, and includes the centrifugal and Coriolis force fields. A velocity feedback control law relating the piezoelectrically induced bending moment at the beam tip with appropriately selected kinematical response quantities is used, and the beneficial effects of its implementation upon the closed loop eigenvibration and dynamic characteristics of the blade are highlighted. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze {{classical}} flutter and active control of single-cell thin-walled composite wind turbine blade beam based on piezoelectric actuation. Effects of piezoelectric actuation for classical flutter suppression on wind turbine blade beam subjected to combined <b>transverse</b> shear deformation, <b>warping</b> restraint effect, and secondary warping are investigated. The extended Hamiltonâ€™s principle is used to set up the equations of motion, and the Galerkin method is applied to reduce the aeroelastic coupled equations into a state-space form. Active control is developed to enhance the vibrational behavior and dynamic response to classical aerodynamic excitation and stabilize structures that might be damaged in the absence of control. Active optimal control scheme based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is implemented.

40|$|A fully {{nonlinear}} {{theory of}} a three-dimensional thin-walled beam, in arbitrary rectangular coordinates {{with the pole}} of the sectorial area at an arbitrary point and {{the origin of the}} sectorial area at an arbitrary point of the beam section, is developed to incorporate <b>transverse</b> shear, torsion-induced <b>warping,</b> and local-buckling-induced cross-section distortion. Based on a geometrically-exact description of the kinematics of deformation, this theory allows large deformation and large overall motion with a general out-of-plane warping function and a general in-plane distortion function. The present theory can exactly reduce to the classical Vlasov theory for vanishing shearing and cross-section distortion in the case of small deformation. The nonlinear weak form of the governing equations of equilibrium is constructed and the linearization of the weak form is derived. A finite element code is developed to implement this generalized thin-walled beam element. The results given by the post-buckling analysis are compared with numerical and/or experimental results to investigate the local buckling effect on the member behavior...|$|R
40|$|In this work, <b>transverse</b> shear <b>warping</b> {{functions}} for an equivalent single layer plate model are formulated from a variational approach. The {{part of the}} strain energy which involves the shear phenomenon is expressed in function of the warping functions and their derivatives. The variational calculus leads to a differential system of equations which warping functions must verify. Solving this system requires the choice of values for the (global) shear strains and their derivatives. A particular choice, which is justified for cross-ply laminates, leads to excellent results. For single layer isotropic and orthotropic plates, an analytical expression of the warping functions is given. They involve hyperbolic trigonometric functions. They differ from the z âˆ’ 4 / 3 z 3 Reddyâ€™s formula which {{has been found to}} be a limit of present warping {{functions for}} isotropic and moderately thick plates. When the h/L and/or the G 13 /E 1 ratios significantly differ from those of isotropic and moderately thick plates, a difference between present warping functions and Reddyâ€™s formula can be observed, even for the isotropic single layer plate. Finite element simulations agree perfectly with the present warping functions in these cases. For multilayer cross-ply configurations, the warping functions are determined using a semi-analytical proce-dure. They have been compared to results of 3 D finite element simulations. They are in excellent agreement. For angle-ply laminates, the above process gives warping functions that seem to have relevant shapes, even if the choice for global shear values cannot be justified in this case. No finite element comparison has been presented at this time because it is difficult to propose boundary conditions and prescribed load that permit to isolate the shear phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear dynamic {{characteristics}} of a composite aircraft wing structure modeled by a geometrically nonlinear anisotropic thin-walled beam {{in the presence of}} simultaneous 1 : 2 internal and 1 : 1 external resonances are investigated. Some prominent non-classical effects such as of <b>transverse</b> shear strain, <b>warping</b> inhibition, and three-dimensional strain are considered in the beam model. Moreover, circumferentially asymmetric stiffness lay-up configuration is adapted to generate the transverse bending-twisting elastic coupling. The solution methodology is based on the Extended Galerkinâ€™s Method, and the method of multiple scales is applied to the system in order to obtain the equations of amplitude and modulation. Steady-state solutions and their stability are investigated. The peculiarity of the internal resonances and the conditions for saturation and jump phenomenon during the modal interactions are discussed and the commercial code ABAQUS is used to validate the theoretical results we have obtained.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{composite}} {{thin wall}} beam element of arbitrary cross-section with open or closed contour is developed. The formulation incorporates {{the effect of}} elastic coupling, restrained <b>warping,</b> <b>transverse</b> shear deformation associated with thin walled composite structures. A first order shear deformation theory is considered with the beam deformation {{expressed in terms of}} axial, spanwise and chordwise bending, corresponding shears and twist. The formulated locking free element uses higher order interpolating polynomial obtained by solving static part of the coupled governing differential equations. The formulated element has super convergent properties as it gives the exact elemental stiffness matrix. Static and free vibration analyses are performed for various beam configuration and compared with experimental and numerical results available in current literature. Good correlation is observed in all cases with extremely small system size. The formulated element is used to study the wave propagation behavior in box beams subjected to high frequency loading such as impact. Simultaneous existence of various propagating modes are graphically captured. Here the effect of transverse shear on wave propagation characteristics in axial and transverse directions are investigated for different ply layup sequences...|$|R
40|$|Liquid crystal {{elastomers}} {{represent a}} novel class of programmable shape-transforming materials whose shape change trajectory is encoded in the materialâ€™s nematic director field. Using three-dimensional nonlinear finite element elastodynamics simulation, we model {{a variety of}} different actuation geometries and device designs: thin films containing topological defects, patterns that induce formation of folds and twists, and a bas-relief structure. The inclusion of finite bending energy in the simulation model reveals features of actuation trajectory that may be absent when bending energy is neglected. We examine geometries with a director pattern uniform through the film thickness encoding multiple regions of positive Gaussian curvature. Simulations indicate that heating such a system uniformly produces a disordered state with curved regions emerging randomly in both directions due to the filmâ€™s up/down symmetry. By contrast, applying a thermal gradient by heating the material first on one side breaks up/down symmetry and results in a deterministic trajectory producing a more ordered final shape. We demonstrate that a folding zone design containing cut-out areas accommodates <b>transverse</b> displacements without <b>warping</b> or buckling; and demonstrate that bas-relief and more complex bent/twisted structures can be assembled by combining simple design motifs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} spatial wood structures, trace their response on equilibrium paths, identify failure modes, and predict the ultimate load. The finite element models of this study are based on the Crafts Pavilion dome (Triax) in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the Church of the Nazarene dome (Varax) in Corvallis, Oregon.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{have been used}} {{over the past years}} in several different civil structures, acquiring a leading role as structural elements [1 - 4]. In particular, FRP profiles are manufactured by so-called automated process of pultrusion. From a mechanical point of view, they can be considered as linear elastic, homogeneous and transversely isotropic, with the plane of isotropy being normal to the longitudinal axis (i. e. the axis of pultrusion). It is generally asserted that their mechanical behavior is highly affected by warping strains due to their small thickness. In addition, low shear moduli, {{more or less the same}} as those of the polymeric resin, can provoke a non-negligible increase in lateral deflections, thus affecting both the local and global buckling loads. Consequently, FRPs members exhibit significant non classical effects such as <b>transverse</b> shear, <b>warping</b> displacements and non-uniform torsional rigidity that make deformability and stability requirements more relevant than the strength limits in the design process. Recently, experimental studies by Mosallam [5] and Feo et al. [6] showed that the condition of a rigid connection should be replaced by a more appropriate assumption due to the presence of a higher local resin concentration in the connection region between the flange and web. Furthermore, taking into account that pultrusion guarantees very high strength and stiffness along the longitudinal direction of the beam, a deeper investigation of this topic is required. In this paper, which is a continuation of previous ones [7 - 8], a geometrically nonlinear model for studying the lateral global buckling problem of a generic open/closed composite beam is presented. The model is based on a full second-order deformable beam theory and accounts for both the warping effects and possible displacement discontinuities at the web/flange interface. Equilibrium nonlinear equations are derived from the Principle of Virtual Displacements. A displacement-based one-dimensional finite element model is also developed. Numerical results are obtained for thin-walled composite beams with open and closed section under flexural/torsional loads. The main aim is to investigate the lateral buckling behavior taking into account the effects of shear and web/flange junction deformability as well as the initial geometric imperfections. The reliability of the mechanical model is assured by comparisons with other numerical and experimental results available in literature. Preliminary results show that deformability and stability requirements are fundamental in the safety analysis of such members...|$|R
