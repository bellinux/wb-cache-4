50|$|On August 19, 2005, {{a jury in}} Texas voted 10-2 to hold Merck {{liable for}} the death of Robert Ernst, a 59-year-old man who {{allegedly}} died of a rofecoxib-induced heart attack. The plaintiff's lead attorney was Mark Lanier. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The jury awarded Carol Ernst, widow of Robert Ernst, $253.4 million in damages. This award will almost certainly be capped at no more than US$26.1 million because of punitive damages limits under Texas law. As of March 2006, the plaintiff had yet to ask the court <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> on the verdict; Merck has stated that it would appeal.On November 3, 2005, Merck won the second case Humeston v. Merck, a personal injury case, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that {{there was no evidence that}} rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk.|$|E
40|$|Jury {{practice}} {{in the state and}} federal courts evolved dramatically in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Around the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, important legal thinkers praised the civil jury as a bulwark against judicial tyranny. By the advent of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, many commentators regarded the civil jury as an antiquated nuisance. Diminishment of the jury and open exercise of judicial power, encouraged in the Federal Rules by procedures such as summary judgment, {{would not have been possible}} without earlier changes in jury practice. Two major changes were the rise of directed verdict procedure and the related judgment notwithstanding the verdict. These mechanisms allowed a judge to give a binding instruction to a jury, or <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> contrary to the jury’s decision. This Study reveals that railroads revolutionized the law of jury control. Changes in directed verdict were part of a larger program of jury reform beginning in the mid-nineteenth century in England, the states, and the federal government. Because of growing numbers of complicated personal injury suits against railroads, and because of perceived jury bias in those cases, many judges sought to control juries more efficiently. Directed verdicts began to replace new trials. Opposition arose, but the overall trend was toward greater judicial control of juries. The striking changes in jury practice described in this Article suggest difficulties in maintaining a consistent jury trial right by constitutional requirement...|$|E
50|$|Three justices wrote dissenting opinions.

Justice Brennan in his dissent noted that the electric service had been {{in the name of a}} third party, Dobson, rather than the plaintiff Jackson, so there was no live controversy between Jackson and the electric company. Without such a controversy, the Supreme Court would not have a basis for ruling, and should instead have remanded the case with instructions <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> new <b>judgment</b> of dismissal. Justice Marshall in his dissent indicated that certiorari should not have been granted for this case, and he would have found state action in the termination as the electric company was a monopoly regulated by the state and had used state-approved procedures in the tariff used in the termination.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, {{the state}} of Tennessee revoked the driver’s {{licenses}} of 1,372 people who collectively owed more than $13 million in child support. In Texas non-custodial parents behind {{more than three months}} in child-support payments can have court-ordered payments deducted from their wages, can have federal income tax refund checks, lottery winnings, or other money that may be due from state or federal sources intercepted by child support enforcement agencies, can have licenses (including hunting and fishing licenses) suspended, and a judge may sentence a nonpaying parent <b>to</b> jail and <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> for past due child support. Some have taken the view that such penalties are unconstitutional. On September 4, 1998, the Supreme Court of Alaska upheld a law allowing state agencies to revoke driver's licenses of parents seriously delinquent in child support obligations. And in the case of United States of America v. Sage, U.S. Court of Appeals (2nd Cir., 1996), the court upheld the constitutionality of a law allowing federal fines and up to two years imprisonment for a person willfully failing to pay more than $5,000 in child support over a year or more when said child resides in a different state from that of the non-custodial parent.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{persons in}} arrears for child support {{payments}} are potentially subject to incarceration. Other penalties for child-support non-payment also exist. Many U.S. states suspend an individual's licenses (i.e. driver's license, business license, contractor license) if that individual has significant arrearage in support payments {{or does not}} consistently pay support. This authority does not extend to professionals who receive licensure through non-governmental agencies. In 2000, the state of Tennessee revoked the driver’s licenses of 1,372 people who collectively owed more than $13 million USD in child support.

40|$|This Note will {{propose the}} {{constitutional}} framework courts should implement when suits are brought against individual foreign officials post-Samantar, specifically {{arguing that the}} constitutional allocation of foreign affairs powers requires U. S. courts to broadly insulate foreign officials from suit absent authorization from a political branch. Part I examines the law of nations and its incorporation into the specific foreign relations powers delegated by the Constitution to the political branches, highlighting that the power to affect relations with foreign sovereigns resides in the political branches. Part II explains the Supreme Court’s development of foreign sovereign immunity and the act of state doctrine—which were both informed by the law of nations—leading up to its decision in Samantar. Part III analyzes Samantar after remand, with particular emphasis on the Fourth Circuit’s judicially created abrogation of immunity for foreign officials when plaintiffs allege violations of jus cogens norms of international law. This Part also describes the considerable problems, particularly constitutionally but also pragmatically, with recognition of a judicially created jus cogens exception to immunity. Part IV proposes the constitutional framework under which analysis of a foreign official’s amenability to suit should proceed. Specifically, this Note argues that the Constitution itself requires U. S. courts <b>to</b> abstain from <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> against current and former officials of recognized foreign sovereigns, absent express authorization from a political branch. Therefore, the Fourth Circuit’s judicially created abrogation of immunity for allegations of jus cogens violations runs afoul {{of the separation of}} powers because it usurps the constitutionally delegated powers of the political branches to shape U. S. foreign relations. Courts should first employ two separate immunity doctrines in suits involving foreign officials: status-based immunity, which bars suits against sitting heads of state and foreign officials, and conduct-based immunity, which bars suits for acts committed by officials in their official capacities. Finally, when suit is brought against an individual who was or is an official of a recognized sovereign for acts committed in his official capacity and within his sovereign territory, U. S. courts should invoke the act of state doctrine to dismiss the suit because it is impermissible for American courts to “sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory,” absent express authorization from a political branch. By refraining from entering judgment in suits against foreign officials, U. S. courts uphold the constitutional allocation of foreign affairs powers to the political branches...|$|R

40|$|These amicus briefs {{are likely}} to {{interest}} legal academics and practitioners who write, research, and practice {{in the areas of}} (1) federal courts, (2) class actions, (3) separation of powers, (4) constitutional law more generally, and (4) federal litigation. In Day v. Persels 2 ̆ 6 Associates, 729 F. 3 d 1309 (11 th Cir. 2013), an absent class member objected to a class-action settlement. The objector argued that the settlement was unfair because, among other reasons, it provided no monetary recovery to the class members. In the district court, prior to class certification and settlement, the defendants and the named plaintiff had consented to authorize a federal magistrate judge <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> final <b>judgment</b> in the action as permitted by 28 U. S. C. 636 (c). When <b>a</b> magistrate judge <b>enters</b> <b>a</b> final <b>judgment</b> under section 636 (c), the judgment is appealable directly to the court of appeals. No Article III district judge has any decision making role. In the lower court in Day, the magistrate judge approved the class-action settlement, and the objector appealed directly to the Eleventh Circuit. At that point, my client—the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA) —entered the picture as an amicus. NACA argued (in order of breadth) that (1) 28 U. S. C. 636 (c) is unconstitutional because consent is an insufficient basis to override the general constitutional requirement that only an Article III judge (and not a non-life-tenured magistrate judge) may <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> final federal-court judgment; (2) even if the parties’ consent to a magistrate judge ordinarily would suffice to make 28 U. S. C. 636 (c) constitutional, the named parties’ consent in a class action is not constitutionally sufficient to bind absent class members because, as the class-action device ordinarily operates, absent class members lack the ability to provide the knowing and voluntary consent necessary to section 636 (c) ’s constitutionality; and (3) at a minimum, if section 636 (c) can be constitutionally employed in a class action, due process demands that the absent class members be notified that the class representatives have decided to give up the absent class members’ constitutional rights to have their case decided by an Article III judge (which the class notice in Day did not do). If the absent class members are notified, they can choose to register their lack of consent to the magistrate judge, in which case the district judge presumably would take over and exercise decision making authority. No party raised these constitutional issues in the district court or in the court of appeals. NACA maintained, however, that because these issues went to the district court’s jurisdiction—that is, the court’s constitutional power to adjudicate—its arguments had to be considered by the Eleventh Circuit. For the same reason, NACA asked for permission both to file an amicus reply brief and to present oral argument—both of which the Eleventh Circuit granted. Though it reversed approval of the settlement on narrow grounds related to the merits of the settlement, the Eleventh Circuit rejected NACA’s jurisdictional arguments by a vote of 2 - 1 in an opinion by Circuit Judge William Pryor. Day, 729 F. 3 d at 1316 - 1326. U. S. District Judge Philip Pro, sitting by designation, dissented in relevant part. Id. at 1328 - 1339. Relying in large part on the reasons provided by NACA, Judge Pro would have ruled on statutory (and not constitutional) grounds that the “parties” eligible to grant consent to a magistrate judge under 28 U. S. C. 636 (c) do not include absent class members. (Interestingly, before he was a district judge, Judge Pro served as a magistrate judge. He has published articles on the role of magistrate judges in the federal judicial system. After Judge Pro became a district judge, Chief Justice Rehnquist appointed him chair of the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System of the Judicial Conference of the United States.) The question whether the magistrate-judge consent provision of 28 U. S. C. 636 (c) is constitutional may take on added importance in light of Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison, No. 12 - 1200 (U. S. argued Jan. 14, 2014), which will be decided this Term by the Supreme Court. Executive Benefits presents a variety of questions about the constitutionality of party consent to adjudication by an Article I bankruptcy judge to decide questions that, in the absent of consent, could only be decided by an Article III judge. A final note: In approving the class-action settlement in Day, the magistrate judge deferred to the settling lawyers’ recommendation that the settlement was a good deal for the class and to what the magistrate judge viewed as the excellent reputations and abilities of the lawyers for class. NACA’s amicus briefs strenuously objected to this holding, which, unfortunately, finds considerable support in class-action case law. NACA argued that the magistrate judge’s deference holding was at odds with the respective roles of lawyers and judges in the adversary system and with judicial independence. NACA argued that deference to lawyers’ reputations and abilities should never play a role in judicial decision making, especially in the class-action context. See Brian Wolfman, Judges! Stop Deferring to Class-Action Lawyers, 2 U. Mich. J. L. Reform (online) 80 A (2013). The Eleventh Circuit in Day did not reach this argument...|$|R
