5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>any</b> attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>any</b> solid conclusions. Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies.|$|E

25|$|More {{than any}} other feature in the test, content {{response}} can be controlled consciously by the subject, and may be elicited by very disparate factors, which {{makes it difficult to}} use content alone <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>any</b> conclusions about the subject's personality; with certain individuals, content responses may potentially be interpreted directly, and some information can at times be obtained by analyzing thematic trends in the whole set of content responses (which is only feasible when several responses are available), but in general content cannot be analyzed outside of the context of the entire test record.|$|E
25|$|The Lombardic {{language}} is extinct (unless Cimbrian and Mocheno represent surviving dialects). The Germanic language declined, {{beginning in the}} 7th century, but {{may have been in}} scattered use until as late as about the year 1000. Only fragments of the language have survived, the main evidence being individual words quoted in Latin texts. In the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>any</b> conclusions about the language's morphology and syntax. The genetic classification of the language depends entirely on phonology. Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the High German consonant shift, it is usually classified as an Elbe Germanic or Upper German dialect.|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{is one of}} the world's largest {{industries}} and {{one of the fastest growing}} economic sectors, responsible for multitude of impacts, both positive and negative, on people's lives and on the environment. Simple indicators or aggregate measures are often used to capture versatile aspects of sustainable tourism. This paper sketches upon several issues related to how composite indicators can summarise multidimensional processes into simplified concepts, and eventually underpin the development of data-based narratives for policy consumption. An attempt is made to summarise the controversy surrounding the use of composite indicators with practical and applied examples from the recent literature. We finally argue in favour of multiple simulations to represent different scenarios in the construction of an index prior <b>to</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>any</b> recommendations for policy-making. JRC.

500|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Procopius of Caesarea, Bessas {{was born in the}} 470s and hailed from a noble Gothic family long established in Thrace, belonging to those Goths who had not followed Theodoric the Great when he left in 488 to invade Italy, then held by Odoacer. Procopius remarks on his fluency in Gothic, but another contemporary writer, Jordanes, claims that he hailed from the settlement of Castra Martis, comprising Sarmatians, Cemandrians, and certain of the Huns (Getica 265). This evidence has been variously interpreted, with most modern commentators leaning towards a Gothic identity. Nevertheless, according to Patrick Amory, it is impossible from the sources at hand <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>any</b> definite conclusion about his ethnicity. Amory maintains that Bessas was a typical example of the [...] "blurry ethnographic identity" [...] evidenced in 6th-century Balkan populations, especially among the military.|$|E
