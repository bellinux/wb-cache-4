5|$|As {{part of the}} Chinese plan {{to capture}} Seoul, the PVA 42nd and the 66th Corps were tasked with {{protecting}} the Chinese left flank by eliminating <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions, while cutting the road between Chuncheon and Seoul. Following instructions, the two Chinese corps struck quickly after midnight on New Year's Eve. The PVA 124th Division first penetrated the flanks of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 2nd Infantry Division, then blocked the division's withdrawal route. The trapped ROK 17th and 32nd Regiments of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 2nd Infantry Division were then forced to retreat in disarray. With the PVA 66th Corps pressuring <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 5th Infantry Division's front, the PVA 124th Division then advanced eastward in the South Korean rear and blocked <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 5th Infantry Division's retreat route as well. The maneuver soon left <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 36th Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 5th Infantry Division surrounded by Chinese, and <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 36th Regiment had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines using mountain trails. By January 1, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> III Corps was in full retreat, while the corps' headquarters had lost contact with the 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions. Responding to the crisis on the central front, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> III Corps sector's defense was handed over the US X Corps.|$|E
5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it {{impossible}} for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> Army transferred that division to the control of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> II Corps on September 7, and attached to it <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 5th Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division penetrated <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to close the gap.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 6th Infantry Division of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> II Corps {{advanced}} westward from Huich'on, and Onjong {{was captured}} {{on the same}} day.

Because the UN Command expected no opposition from the destroyed KPA, the advances were not coordinated between the UN units.

5|$|On {{the central}} front, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> III Corps defended the 38th {{parallel}} north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 2nd, 5th, 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> III Corps placed <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank {{in the hills}} north of Gapyeong, while <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The winter conditions created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition resupply.

5|$|The loss of {{surprise}} {{due to the}} early start of the First Phase Campaign greatly disappointed Mao. Nevertheless, Mao still urged Peng to destroy the South Koreans by baiting them with trapped ROK units. At the same time, Major General Yu Jai Hung, commander of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> II Corps, sent <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 19th Infantry Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 6th Infantry Division (under Colonel Park Kwang Hyuk) and <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 10th Infantry Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 8th Infantry Division (under Colonel Go Geun Hong) to recapture Onjong and to salvage the lost equipment from the battle. <b>The</b> <b>ROK</b> 7th Infantry Regiment, {{under the command of}} Colonel Im Pu Taek, was also ordered to retreat south with <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 6th Infantry Division. Hoping to draw the rest of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> II Corps into the open, Peng ordered the PVA 118th Division to swing north and to trap the retreating ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, while the PVA 119th and the 120th Division of the 40th Corps would wait to ambush any rescue forces passing through Onjong. On October 27, the PVA 118th Division isolated <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 7th Infantry Regiment by cutting the road between Kojang and Onjong, but <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 7th Infantry Regiment did not reach the roadblock {{due to the lack of}} fuel. Upon realizing that <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> II Corps had not fallen for the deception, Peng ordered the 119th and the 120th Divisions to destroy <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 10th and 19th Infantry Regiment. On the night of October 28, the ambush by the two Chinese divisions quickly decimated the advancing ROK regiments at the east of Onjong, and the Chinese roadblocks in the rear areas forced the South Korean soldiers to abandon all vehicles and artillery in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Acting on Ridgway's prediction, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> Army Headquarters {{ordered all}} units to full alert at dusk on December 31, {{but many of}} its {{soldiers}} were either drunk from the New Year celebration or had abandoned their posts in order to escape the cold. The Chinese artillery units began to shell the South Korean defenses at 16:30 on December 31. The first blow fell on <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 12th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division, due to the unit's positioning as both the boundary between <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 1st and 6th Infantry Divisions and the boundary between US I and IX Corps. Because the river banks on ROK 12th Regiment's flanks were composed of high cliffs difficult for the attackers to scale, most of the regiment's strength were used to defend its center. Upon noticing this development, the PVA 39th Corps decided to use ROK 12th Regiment's flanks as the main points of attack {{in order to achieve}} maximum surprise. Following a feint attack on <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 12th Regiment's center, the PVA 116th and the 117th Divisions of the 38th Corps struck both flanks of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 12th Regiment. <b>The</b> <b>ROK</b> 12th Regiment was caught off guard and offered little resistance, and within hours the regiment was cut to pieces with a battery of the US 9th Field Artillery Battalion seized by the Chinese. Under the cover of the fleeing Korean soldiers, the attacking Chinese forces then penetrated <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 15th Regiment's defense without firing a shot. Desperate to contain the Chinese breakthrough, Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 1st Infantry Division used the division's rear service personnel to form an assault battalion, but the battalion was unable to stop the Chinese advance. With only <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 11th Regiment remaining intact by the morning of January 1, <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 1st Infantry Division was forced to withdraw on January 2.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of functional parameters {{for evaluating the}} severity of low back pain is gaining clinical recognition, with evidence suggesting that the angular velocity of lordosis is critical for identification of musculoskeletal deficits. However, {{there is a lack}} of data regarding the range of functional kinematics (RoKs), particularly which include the changing shape and curvature of the spine. We address this deficit by characterising the angular velocity of lordosis throughout the thoracolumbar spine according to age and gender. The velocity of lumbar back shape changes was measured using Epionics SPINE during maximum flexion and extension activities in 429 asymptomatic volunteers. The difference between maximum positive and negative velocities represented <b>the</b> <b>RoKs.</b> <b>The</b> mean <b>RoKs</b> for flexion decreased with age; 114 °/s (20 - 35 years), 100 °/s (36 - 50 years) and 83 °/s (51 - 75 years). For extension, <b>the</b> corresponding mean <b>RoKs</b> were 73 °/s, 57 °/s and 47 °/s. ANCOVA analyses revealed that age and gender had the largest influence on <b>the</b> <b>RoKs</b> (p< 0. 05). The Epionics SPINE system allows the rapid assessment of functional kinematics in the lumbar spine.

After two hours of fighting, the 1st Battalion of <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 17th Regiment recaptured two-thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment. The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14, but <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to blunt the attack.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Onjong, the Chinese recognized <b>the</b> <b>ROK</b> II Corps as the most vulnerable unit of the Eighth Army.
