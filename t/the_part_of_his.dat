25|$|Based on {{his initial}} {{confession}}, Riley, {{who was an}} adult over 18 (aged 20) {{at the time of}} the crime, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for killing Jim and Naomi Olive and faced the death penalty. Under hypnosis, Riley later recanted <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> initial confession about beating Naomi Olive with the hammer, saying that when he entered the house, he found Naomi Olive lying in bed, bleeding from head wounds and near death, with the hammer embedded in her head. Riley thus implied that Marlene Olive (who had been using the hammer that morning to repair a platform shoe) had fatally beaten her mother with the hammer before leaving the house. Riley contended that he had stabbed and suffocated Naomi Olive because she was suffering and near death from the hammer attack, and he was trying to end her misery. He said that he initially confessed to killing Naomi Olive in order to protect Marlene Olive by taking the blame for her actions. Riley admitted shooting Jim Olive, but said he acted out of fear and self-defense as Jim had threatened to kill him.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{he finds}} out that Harry and his friends are hunting and {{destroying}} his Horcruxes. After offering the occupants of Hogwarts mercy if they give up Harry, he assembles a large army and launches an invasion of the castle, where Harry is searching for Ravenclaw's Lost Diadem, one of the Horcruxes. Voldemort orders his pet snake Nagini to execute Snape, believing it would make him the true master of the Elder Wand, since Snape killed Dumbledore. He then calls an hour's armistice, in exchange for Harry. When Harry willingly walks into Voldemort's camp in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort strikes him down with the Elder Wand. However, the use of Harry's blood to resurrect Voldemort's body proves {{to be a major}} setback: while Harry's blood runs in Voldemort's veins, Harry cannot be killed as his mother's protection lives on now in Voldemort too. Instead, Voldemort destroys <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own soul that resides in Harry’s body. Voldemort forces Rubeus Hagrid to carry Harry's apparently lifeless body back to the castle as a trophy, sparking another battle during which Nagini, his last Horcrux, is destroyed by Neville Longbottom. The battle then moves into the Great Hall, where Voldemort fights Minerva McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Horace Slughorn simultaneously. Harry then reveals himself and explains to Voldemort that Draco became the true master of the Elder Wand when he disarmed Dumbledore; Harry, in turn, won the wand's allegiance when he took Draco's wand. Refusing to believe this, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse with the Elder Wand while Harry uses a Disarming Charm with Draco's, but the Elder Wand refuses to kill its master and the spell rebounds on Voldemort who, with all of his Horcruxes destroyed, finally dies. His body is laid in a different chamber from all the others who died battling him.|$|E

These include [...] "Religion and Art" [...] (1880) and [...] "Heroism and Christianity" [...] (1881), which were printed in the journal Bayreuther Blätter, published by his supporter Hans von Wolzogen. Wagner's sudden interest in Christianity at this period, which infuses Parsifal, was contemporary with his increasing alignment with German nationalism, and required on his part, and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> associates, [...] "the rewriting of some recent Wagnerian history", so as to represent, for example, the Ring as a work reflecting Christian ideals.

Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east.

500|$|The {{surviving}} {{translations of}} the fatwa give {{the name of}} the author in various slightly different forms. All of them are thought to be derived from the Arabic name Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani, with some adding the name 'Ubaydallah, which might be a pious formula meaning [...] "the little servant of God". The author's nisba— <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name that indicates place of origin— al-Wahrani ("of Oran") refers to the city of Oran ( [...] ,Wahran) in modern-day Algeria, then part of the Zayyanid kingdom of Tlemcen. Thus, the author {{is often referred to as}} [...] "the Mufti of Oran" [...] and the document is called [...] "the Oran fatwa", even though there appeared to be no indication that the fatwa was issued in Oran or that the author resided or had an official authority in Oran. Devin Stewart, an academic specialist in Islamic studies, identified the author as Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani (b.unknownd.1511 in Fez), a Maliki jurist who had studied in Oran and Tlemcen and probably issued the fatwa in Fez while a professor of Islamic law there.|$|E

Once the sealing is completed, the Reaper would consume the souls of both the user and the sealed, sentencing them to be locked in combat within the Reaper's stomach for all eternity. However, in cases where only part of the target's soul is sealed, the corresponding body part is paralyzed and suffers from extremely painful necrosis. The Fourth and Third Hokage executed the Reaper Death Seal during their respective battles with Kurama and Orochimaru. In both cases, both Hokage were forced to only take a part of their opponents down with them: Minato taking the Yin aspect of Kurama while Hiruzen is forced take the part of Orochimaru's soul within his arms in an attempt to ensure his former pupil would never perform a jutsu again. Later, in the Part II during the events of the Fourth Great Ninja War, Orochimaru uses an Uzumaki clan mask to summon the Reaper in a risky move, and breaks the Reaper Death Seal by cutting the demon's stomach wide open. With the Reaper Death Seal undone, the souls of the previous four Hokage are reanimated while Orochimaru regains <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul he had lost years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Keable's novels won him immense {{international}} {{popularity and}} intense controversy. His novels were equated with Mrs Humphry Ward's Robert Elsmere, a similarly scandalous tale of religious doubt among the clergy published 40 years earlier: H.D.A. Major, {{editor of the}} Modern Churchman magazine, made this comparison with respect to Keable's Peradventure, noting [...] "It is slighter, but it has need to be. The twentieth century novel reader is intellectually and morally lighter than the nineteenth." [...] Reporting his death, the Melbourne Argus attributed the best-selling popularity of Keable's novels to the licentiousness of their contents: [...] "they have no literary value". His former college acquaintance James later wrote that [...] "his friends sought to dissuade him from publication. The transition from the beautiful book on The Loneliness of Christ (1914) – of his Central African period – to Simon Called Peter (1921) came as a great shock to all who had known and loved him in earlier days." [...] Where Rosemary Grimble calls Keable's novels [...] "splendidly erotic", a Birmingham News correspondent in Birmingham, Alabama, accused Keable of [...] "fashioning abnormalities". Other critics called his success [...] "undeserved" [...] and attributed it to prurience on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> readers. Reviewers also suggested that the contrast between Keable's ecclesiastical background and the frank, often sexual, content of his novels attracted curiosity in itself. A Time columnist, [...] "J.F.", expressed the fascination of this disconnect overtly, responding to a piece titled [...] "The censorship of thought" [...] that Keable had contributed to a 1922 volume, Nonsenseorship (sic), after Simon Called Peters publication had made him notorious. [...] "Surely, here is a modern personality worth {{the study of the}} psychologists," [...] J.F. wrote, noting the romance of Keable's unusual circumstances: [...] "From a quiet English clergyman to the author of a sensational best-seller who has taken up his permanent residence in the South Seas seems a long jump." [...] In person, he said, Keable was the antithesis of his novels' striking directness: He does not impress one as a radical gentleman. There is nothing to suggest the resigned clergyman, author of books marked by their sex frankness and melodrama. In fact, his scholarly bearing and gentleness mark him rather as the country curate, who should be acting as a character in a novel by May Sinclair and passing out crumpets to maiden ladies in a decorous drawing-room instead of writing of Tahitian damsels as he has done in his new novel, Numerous Treasure.|$|E

Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like symbiotic entity known as [...] to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history so one among them can manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he created the entity's host body , who like his assumed clone brothers was actually a human who mutated as a result of being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya's Infinite Tsukuyomi ages ago. Though he and White Zetsu are effective in their symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location or separate himself from <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body holding Black Zetsu and uses spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches. This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those that the organization does not want found. Another of the White Zetsu that Black Zetsu brought out of the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as [...] due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, is later named [...] and served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth was getting used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu went into hiding until it later merges itself onto Obito to force the human into resurrecting Madara. But ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan ran its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit. Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha while helping Kaguya deal with Naruto and Sasuke, eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severed Kaguya's arm. Seeing Kaguya being sealed away again, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator. Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style before ejecting him once Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukiyomi, is last seen crumbling after the jutsu is canceled with his former captive the only witness to his death.|$|E
