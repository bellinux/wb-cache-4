5|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See,</b> another Catholic see has {{the right}} to bear the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon.

While the coat of arms of <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff.|$|E

5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain the support of <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stephen Báthory {{had decided}} to secure the Bishopric of Kraków for his nephew, but <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> did not appoint Andrew coadjutor bishop of the Kraków See, because he was still too young. The king wanted to invade Russia and sent Andrew to Rome to {{convince}} Pope Sixtus V to support his plan. Andrew left Poland on 22 March 1586. Samuel Zborowski's brothers (he had been executed on Stephen Báthory's orders), wanted to capture and murder Andrew, but their plan failed because of a flood. Andrew came to Rome on 24 July. He informed the pope about Stephen Báthory's plan, asking financial support from <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> against Russia.|$|E

Thereafter, Andrew urged <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> to send Franciscan friars to Transylvania {{instead of the}} Jesuits (who were supported by Sigismund Báthory). He also suggested that the pope should make a Franciscan friar bishop of Transylvania, with a see in Csíksomlyó (now Șumuleu Ciuc in Romania). He settled Catholic priests in four villages on his estates. <b>The</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> authorized him to set up deaneries in Transylvania, making him the actual head of the Catholic Church in the principality.|$|E

5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry.

Blanche of Navarre soon approached <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her sister) was not questioned.|$|E

The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia.
