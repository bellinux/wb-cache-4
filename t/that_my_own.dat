In October 2013, Ink stated in interviews that the album would be released in December 2013. It was his intent to release the album {{before the end of}} 2013.

500|$|Tan {{completed}} her A-levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School, a residential special {{school for the}} deaf, where she was a prefect. [...] She also won an Elizabeth Dyson Prize for progress and achievement and a prize for business studies. From the age of 18, she stopped horse riding for eight years to pursue an honours degree in hospitality management and tourism at Oxford Brookes University, and for {{a job as a}} mental health worker. However, she missed the sport and took it up again in 2005. Tan said, [...] "For me, riding a horse gives me the freedom, movement and energy <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> legs cannot do." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 14, {{she studied}} at North Division High School and worked part-time. Her mother {{wanted her to}} leave school and marry, but she demurred. She bought a train ticket to Denver, Colorado, and {{went to live with}} her married sister, Sheyna Korngold. The Korngolds held {{intellectual}} evenings at their home, where Meir was exposed to debates on Zionism, literature, women's suffrage, trade unionism, and more. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "To the extent <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> future convictions were shaped and given form... those talk-filled nights in Denver played a considerable role." [...] In Denver, she also met Morris Meyerson (also [...] "Myerson"; December 17, 1893 – May 25, 1951), a sign painter, whom she later married on December 24, 1917.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Hudson's {{press release}} {{disclosing}} his infection, William M. Hoffman, {{the author of}} As Is, a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: [...] "If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It's just a disease, not a moral affliction." [...] At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: [...] "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS {{to the attention of}} the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage." [...] Morgan Fairchild said that [...] "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face." [...] In a telegram Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend in person, Hudson said: [...] "I am not happy that I am sick. I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> misfortune has had some positive worth." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later Bakiyev commented from his {{hometown}} of Osh {{that he would not}} resign and called for the UN to send troops to the country to restore order. A rally in his hometown was followed by another bigger rally giving him support in his quest to return to the seat of government. In response the interim Interior Minister said an arrest warrant would be issued for him while his immunity was removed. On 13 April, Bakiyev said he would resign should his security and that of his family and entourage be guaranteed. He said [...] "In what case would I resign? First of all, they should guarantee that in Kyrgyzstan there are no more people walking around with weapons, and no seizures or redistribution of property. Also, I need to know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> security and the security of members of my family and those close to me will be assured." [...] The interim government said it could only guarantee his security should he resign and leave the country. Tension mounted in the country when the interim government threatened to hunt down Bakiyev while simultaneously offering an olive branch should he go to into exile. In response Bakiyev said [...] "Let them try to seize me. Let them try to kill me. I believe this will lead to such a great deal of bloodshed which no one will be able to justify." [...] During a nuclear summit in Washington the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev suggested Kyrgyzstan was {{in the throes of a}} civil war and that it could turn into a [...] "second Afghanistan" [...] if the political deadlock was not resolved. He said that [...] "The risk of Kyrgyzstan breaking apart – into the south and the north – really exist." [...] On 14 April 2010, interim leader Roza Otunbayeva announced that President Bakiyev, his defense minister, as well as relatives in government and political allies would face trial over the deaths of protesters. A Kyrgyz court issued an arrest warrant for Bakiyev's brother Janybek Bakiyev, eldest son Marat Bakiyev and former Prime Minister Daniar Usenov.|$|E
