The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E

5|$|The siting of noxious industries, such as <b>tanning</b> and fulling {{downwind}} {{outside the}} boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was downwind {{from the rest of the}} city), meaning that most odors from their businesses would not go into the city but outside, and thereby reduced complaints.|$|E
5|$|The tan lines {{created by}} the wearing of a bikini while <b>tanning</b> are known as a bikini tan.

5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his <b>tanning</b> business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence.

The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
