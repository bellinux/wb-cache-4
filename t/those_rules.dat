On 19 August, associations of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) met with the Secretary of Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) S K Sarkar and demanded that the central government should modify the rules related to suspension of bureaucrats by state governments, as <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> were widely abused. The three associations want the central government instead of various state governments to {{have the authority to}} suspend any All India Services officer.|$|E
5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} is {{found by the}} umpire to have {{delivered}} the ball contrary to <b>those</b> <b>rules,</b> the umpire will call a no ball and {{he is said to}} have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.|$|E
25|$|Between 1075 and the 15th century, the cathedrals of England {{were almost}} evenly divided between <b>those</b> <b>ruled</b> by secular canons {{headed by a}} dean and <b>those</b> <b>ruled</b> by monastic orders headed by a prior, {{all of which were}} Benedictine except Carlisle. Two cathedrals, Bath and Coventry, shared their sees with Wells and Lichfield, respectively.|$|R

He also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example between monarchy and tyranny.|$|R
25|$|Over-{{claiming}} for {{council tax}} on second home: MPs {{were able to}} round up actual amounts due, claiming for 12 monthly instalments where only 10 were due or by claiming up to £250.00 per month with no receipt required until <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> were changed. Over 50 MPs were alleged to have over-claimed council tax.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} reduce the time of games sought by <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> was successful, {{reducing}} the average college football page from 3:21 hours in 2005 to 3:07 hours in 2006. However, the reduced game time also reduced {{the average number of}} plays in a game by 13, 66 fewer offensive yards per game and average points per game by 5.|$|E
25|$|A turret deck ship {{is a type}} of {{merchant}} ship with an unusual hull, designed and built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The hulls of turret deck vessels were rounded and stepped inward above their waterlines. This gave some advantages in strength and allowed them to pay lower canal tolls under tonnage measurement rules then in effect. The type ceased to be built after <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> changed.|$|E

30|$|With the {{exception}} of a partial payroll tax holiday in 2011 and 2012, few American taxpayers saw a significant change in the personal income or payroll tax rules during the years 2007 – 13. But several safety net benefit rules were changed after 2007 in ways that created new implicit taxes on earnings and employment. Most of <b>those</b> <b>rule</b> changes related to unemployment insurance and SNAP.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not known}} when the rules were changed to outlaw {{striking}} for the ball a second time or when the offence of obstructing the field was introduced, but both <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> were clearly stated in the 1744 codification of the Laws of Cricket, which were drawn up by the London Cricket Club and {{are believed to be}} based on a much earlier code that has been lost.|$|E
25|$|Sleep also {{influences}} language development. To test this, researchers taught infants a faux {{language and}} observed their {{recollection of the}} rules for that language. Infants who slept within four hours of learning the language could remember the language rules better, while infants who stayed awake longer did not recall <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> as well. There is also a relationship between infants' vocabulary and sleeping: infants who sleep longer at night at 12 months have better vocabularies at 26 months.|$|E
25|$|From the {{observation}} of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building {{as a whole and}} all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> of proportion are. Brunelleschi gained the support of a number of wealthy Florentine patrons, including the Silk Guild and Cosimo de' Medici.|$|E

50|$|By the 8th century, the Islamic empire {{extended}} from Iberia {{in the west}} to the Indus river in the east. Polities such as <b>those</b> <b>ruled</b> by the Umayyads (in the Middle East and later in Iberia), Abbasids, Fatimids, and Mamluks were among the most influential powers in the world. The Islamic civilization gave rise to many centers of culture and science and produced notable astronomers, mathematicians, doctors and philosophers during the Golden Age of Islam.|$|R
25|$|A {{variant of}} bandy, rink bandy, is played {{to the same}} rules but on a field {{the size of an}} ice hockey rink, with ice hockey goal cages and with six players on each team, or five in USA Rink Bandy League. Traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy are {{recognised}} by the International Olympic Committee. More informal varieties also exist, like seven-a-side bandy with normally sized goal cages but without corner strokes. <b>Those</b> <b>rules</b> were applied at Davos Cup in 2016.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} fewer notable English {{players who have}} played in Scotland. Joe Baker was {{the first player to}} play for England without having played in the Football League, but his was an {{isolated}} example because he played at a time when a player was only allowed to play for the country of his birth. <b>Those</b> <b>rules</b> have subsequently been relaxed and the sons or even grandsons of Scots are now allowed to play for Scotland. This means that some English-born players have played in and for Scotland, including Andy Goram and Stuart McCall.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 an {{interview}} within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, {{a change in}} attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture {{in order to be}} able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce <b>those</b> <b>rules.</b> This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.|$|E

25|$|The Leadville strike had winnowed out miners {{who were}} {{antagonistic}} toward, or not fully {{supportive of the}} union's goals. The members who were left agreed that they {{were engaged in a}} class-based struggle that called for a more militant and confrontational disposition. Employers themselves had dictated the old rules for the struggle, but after Leadville the union no longer believed <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> applied. Many of the WFM members were moving beyond reformist sentiments, to a realization that if they were to obtain the just solution that they sought, the system needed to be overturned. In a document called the November 1897 proclamation, the union miners and their allies vowed to launch a new federation which would reflect their growing class consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Together {{these studies}} suggest that infants are able to extract a {{substantial}} amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language. Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or {{in the middle of the}} sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying <b>those</b> <b>rules</b> to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay.|$|E
25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit protected mode if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to <b>those</b> <b>rules,</b> protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E
