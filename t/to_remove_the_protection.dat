Comparative study of the deprotection using a PGA, trisarylsulfonium antimonyhexafluoride (SSb), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was {{performed}} on glass microscope slides. The results showed that PGA can replace TFA in the deprotection step of oligopeptide synthesis with comparable efficiencies.

The accuracy of the amino acid sequence of the synthesized oligopeptide and the location of the synthesis was illustrated by the specific recognition binding of two different models: lead(II) ion-peptide biosensor for lead(II) and human protein p 53 (residue 20 - 25) -mouse MAb DO 1. After parallel synthesis of the target peptide models and their analogues based on the predetermined pattern, specific binding treatment, and fluorescence labeling, the fluorescence emission images of the oligopeptide microarray showed fluorescence intensity as a result of specific binding at the correct locations of the array. The stepwise synthesis efficiencies of pentapeptide synthesis on the microwell substrate range are 96 - 100 % and do not decrease with respect to the chain length of the peptide...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: This report {{describes}} {{the cases of}} 2 patients with failed retrieval of an AngioGuard distal protection device after carotid stent placement with rescue retrieval by use of a vertebral catheter. An AngioGuard was deployed before carotid angioplasty and stent placement. Attempted removal of the device with the provided recapture sheath was unsuccessful. A 5 F 120 -cm vertebral catheter was used to recapture and remove the AngioGuard. This technique is a simple and readily available solution for the retrieval of failed removal of a protection device. Symptomatic carotid stenosis is a disease process that hasbeen traditionally treated with carotid endarterectomy and {{has been shown to}} be superior to medical management (the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study). 1, 2 The first reported placement of a carotid stent was performed in the mid- 1990 s, 3 but carotid stent placement has truly come into the realmof treatment of carotid artery disease with the advent of self-expanding stents and distal protection devices. In 2004, the SAPPHIRE trial was published, suggest-ing that carotid stent placement is at least equivalent to carotid endarterectomy in the measured outcomes of death, stroke, andmyocardial infarction for the high-risk patient population enrolled in the study. 4 Recently, the Precise RX microcatheter-based, self-ex-panding, nitinol stent (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla) received ap-proval from the US Food and Drug Administration for use in carotid stenosis. With the application of this stent placement technology combined with balloon angioplasty and the An-gioGuard (Cordis) distal protection device, this technique has allowed for the treatment of patients who are deemed at high surgical risk on the basis of their medical comorbidities. Dur-ing the recent use at our institution of the AngioGuard distal protection device in 2 patients requiring carotid angioplasty and stent placement, the manufacturer-provided retrieval de-vice failed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> device.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{show the}} {{significance}} the power to define may have. It analyzes the policy process and policy outcomes regarding the status, treatment and form of trial given to the “enemy combatants” during the George W. Bush administration and the War on Terror, and how the Bush administration used its power to define with relative success. The analysis is provided by a close reading of four documents central to the policy process. The four documents are two memoranda from within the executive branch, a presidential signing statement, and an executive order. The policy choices made and the degree the Bush administration used its power to define proved to have significant consequences for {{the balance of power}} between the three branches of government, and for the “enemy combatants. ” By applying three theories on the policy process, the analyzed documents and their context the thesis attempts to find if the theories may provide additional insight into how George W. Bush ran the executive branch, and why the policy outcomes turned out as they did. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Bush declared a “War on Terror” which led to the invasion of two Middle Eastern countries, Afghanistan and Iraq. The two wars led to an influx of prisoners held by the United States’ military and the Central Intelligence Agency, most prominently in the prison facilities at Guantanamo Bay, the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad and in secret CIA-operated prisons in several undisclosed locations around the world. The influx of prisoners and a need to prevent further terrorist attacks on American soil caused the Bush administration to use its defining powers to initiate a host of controversial policies. Leading among these was <b>the</b> policy choice <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>protections</b> provided <b>the</b> prisoners by the Geneva Conventions and the United States Constitution, the creation of the “enemy combatants,” and a new and very narrow definition of what constituted torture. Congress and the Supreme Court tried to curb the increased powers the executive claimed, and the policy choices the administration made with regard to the enemy combatants. The attempts made by the two other branches of government gained only limited success for the majority of Bush’s two terms, but the Supreme Court was able to strike some of Bush’s policies down in two central cases; Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, and Boumediene v. Bush. After Barack Obama took office he has reversed almost every policy choice the Bush administration made with regard to the enemy combatants, which signals a new course for the executive branch and the United States’ government...|$|R

40|$|Unauthorized code {{modification}} through {{reverse engineering}} {{is a major}} concern for Android application developers. Code reverse engineering is often used by adversaries <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> copyright <b>protection</b> or advertisements from the app, or to inject malicious code into the program. By making the program difficult to analyze, code obfuscation is a potential solution to the problem. However, there is currently little work on applying code obfuscation to compiled Android bytecode. This paper presents DexPro, a novel bytecode level code obfuscation system for Android applications. Unlike prior approaches, our method performs on the Android Dex bytecode and does not require access to high-level program source or modification of the compiler or the VM. Our approach leverages the fact all except floating operands in Dex are stored in a 32 -bit register to pack two 32 -bit operands into a 64 -bit operand. In this way, any attempt to decompile the bytecode will result in incorrect information. Meanwhile, our approach obfuscates the program control flow by inserting opaque predicates before the return instruction of a function call, which makes it harder for the attacker to trace calls to protected functions. Experimental results show that our approach can deter sophisticate reverse engineering and code analysis tools, and the overhead of runtime and memory footprint is comparable to existing code obfuscation methods...|$|R

Thus, it is imperative that feminists continue to fight the numerous encroachments that are being made on women 2 ̆ 7 s reproductive freedoms.

40|$|In {{the context}} of its Digital Single Market Strategy (DSMS) the EU Commission is {{currently}} engaged {{in a discussion of}} whether the liability principles and rules envisaged by Directive 2000 / 31 (the Ecommerce Directive) should be amended. One of the principal concerns in relation to unlicensed online intermediaries (notably unlicensed hosting providers) is that these have been increasingly said to invoke the safe harbour immunities in the Ecommerce Directive lacking the conditions for their application. This alleged abuse has led to a distortion of the online marketplace and the resulting ‘value gap’ indicated by some rightholders. This contribution discusses a recent proposal advanced in France which asks <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> safe harbour <b>protection</b> pursuant to Article 14 of the Ecommerce Directive for hosting providers that give access to copyright works. After addressing some of the points raised by the French proposal, this work concludes that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has not erred in its interpretation of relevant provisions of the Ecommerce Directive and that – in practice – the removal of safe harbour protection for passive hosting providers that give access to copyright works would not provide any distinct advantages to rightholders. Overall, the current framework already provides an adequate degree of protection: what is required is a rigorous application by national courts of the principles enshrined in the Ecommerce Directive, as interpreted by the CJEU.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{historical}} development of rural economic system in China from the Chinese Revolution in 1911 to the present time, especially focusing on the main stages of institutional changes after 1949, i. e. the stage of Land Reform (1949 - 1952), the stage of Collectivization (1953 - 1957), the stage of Great Leap Forward and the People 2 ̆ 7 s Communes (1958 - 1978), and the stage of Rural Reform (1978 -). The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the process of the above-mentioned changes and to find the main factors which caused these changes, on the basis of the statistical data and based on the papers on this field now available. The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. 1. In the stage of Land Reform, through the vital activity of the Land Reform Cadres Teams, the strong link was established between the local political power mainly led by the Land Reform Cadres and the rural political power mainly led by the members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) born as poor peasants and actively joined the Land Reform Movement. On the basis of this strong link, the strong political foundation of the CCP was established in the vast rural areas. And this strong political foundation in the rural areas made it easy for the CCP to change the rural economic system from that time on. In this sense, we can think of the Land Reform as the starting point of the rural institutional changes from that time on. 2. In the stage of Collectivization, the Collectivization Movement did not progress according to the planed order of the process of establishing the Mutual Aid Teams, the process of establishing the ‘semi-socialist co-operatives, and the process of establishing the ‘full-socialist 2 ̆ 7 co-operatives. In fact, most of the peasant households were made to enter directly into the third process, and the third process was finished in a year or so. It seems that this rapid progress of the Collectivization Movement was caused by the following three needs. The first is the need of establishing the system for the Compulsory Procurement Plan of Agriculture Products (mainly food grains). The second is the need of mobilizing the rural labors to carry out the irrigation and drainage projects in large, in order to increase the farm produce. The third is the need of the very tight control over the rural-urban population movement, in order to ensure building up the capital-intensive state industrial enterprises. 3. In the stage of Great Leap Forward and the People 2 ̆ 7 s Communes, the ‘full-socialist’ co-ops were transformed into the People 2 ̆ 7 s Communes in 1958 within a month or so. It seems that this rapid transformation was caused by the following two needs. One is the need of self-construction in Chinese economy, under unavoidable antagonism between China and Soviet Union. Another is the need of local industrialization which aims at overcoming the contradiction between the local industry and the central industry during the First Five Year Plan. The farm crisis during the Great Leap Forward caused major policy changes. Major reforms occurred in the structure of the People 2 ̆ 7 s Communes, and the Production Teams became main units of the collective. The structure of three grades composed of Production Teams, Production Brigades and the Communes was formed for the collective. But during the Great Cultural Revolution, the institutions carried out during the Great Leap Forward, were repeated again in the rural areas. 4. In the stage of Rural Reform, a series of rural reforms occurred after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CCP in December 1978. The series of rural reforms consist of the following four kinds of reforms. The first is, to raise the procurement price of agricultural products, to aim at abolishment of the Compulsory Procurement Plan of Agricultural Products, and partly to utilize the market mechanism. The second is, to introduce the Production Responsibility System, and to develop the private family farms. The third is, to dissolve the People 2 ̆ 7 s Communes, and to reorganize the rural political power and the collective economic system. The fourth is, to develop <b>the</b> rural industry, <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>protections</b> of <b>the</b> State Enterprises, and to promote fair competition. It seems that these reforms suggest the change of the strategy on economic development in China. Though the above-mentioned institutional change is very dizzy, it seems that there are two essential and constant elements to influence the change of rural economic system in China. One is the establishment of the sovereignty of China in the international society. Another is the achievement of modernization and industrialization of China. Since 1949, under the passing international and internal conditions, this two state targets have constantly influenced the change of the economic system in China. これまでに入手しえた文献及び統計資料を基礎として,本稿で考察した内容を要約すると次のようになろう. 1. 土地改革運動は,中国の封建的な地主制度を覆したばかりでなく,土地改革工作隊の積極的な活動によって,中国の広大な農村地域に強固な末端政権組織を作り出した. 土地改革運動こそ,中国共産党の確固たる政治基盤を用意し,その後の一連の政治的な強制による農村経済体制の変革を容易にしたものである. このような意味で,土地改革は中国の農村経済体制の変革の起点と言えよう. 2. 農業集団化運動は互助組-初級社-高級社の順序で段階的に進行したのではなく,大部分の農民はほぼ 1 年間のうちに一気に高級社に加入させられた. このように急ぎ足で農業集団化を達成する過程で,同時に農業余剰の国家掌握のための農産物統一購買・統一販売制度が確立され,また労働力の移動を制限する役割を果たす厳しい戸籍制度が確立され推進された. このことは,農業集団化運動が社会主義思想のイデオロギー的な要因だけで推進されたのではなく,その背後に深刻な経済的要因に基づく要請があったことを示唆している. つまり, 1953 年以降の大規模な資本集約型の国家工業化を推進するために,農村の労働力を投入して農業基盤整備を行い,農業余剰を増加させる必要があり,また,国家がこの農業余剰を掌握し,さらに農村余剰労働力の都市への流出を防止する必要が生じ,従ってそれらの機能を果たす農村組織を作り出す必要が生じた. 3. 1958 年に,約 1 カ月という短期間のうちに急に高級社体制が人民公社体制に変わった事実の背後には,国際的には,中ソ対立の深化に伴い,外部からの援助の中止に備えるために,自力更正の方針をとることが余儀なくされ,また,中国の国際的な孤立化に伴い,一層の主権の確保が要求され,軍需工業を中心とする重工業化が急がれたという事情がある. 国内的には,第 1 次 5 カ年計画の地方軽視によってもたらされた矛盾を克服するために,地方工業化が要請されたという事情がある. さらに, 1958 年から 1978 年までの人民公社体制を, 1958 ～ 1961 年の大躍進の混乱期, 1962 ～ 1965 年の安定期, 1966 ～ 1978 年の文化大革命の混乱期とおおまかに区分すると,安定期には,それは実質的に高級社の体制に戻り,混乱期には,いわゆる「一大二公」の人民公社の理念に基づく高度集中型の計画経済に移行したことが明らかである. 4. 1978 年末から 1984 年まで進行した農村改革は, 4 つの関連する内容を含んでいた. つまり,第 1 に,農産物価格引き上げに始まり,農産物統一購買・統一販売制度の撤廃を目指す価格改革,第 2 に,生産責任制の実施による自主経営農家の創出と育成,第 3 に,人民公社制度の解体と農村政権組織の再編,第 4 に,農村工業化の助成に始まり,国営工業保護政策の撤廃と各種所有制の企業聞の公平な競争を目指す改革である. この一連の農村改革は,新中国の成立以来の経済発展戦略とそれに関連する一連の制度を根幹から変えたものであり,その背後には複雑な要因が存在するものと考えられる. 新中国の成立以来,農村経済体制は目まぐるしく変わり,その変わり目にはいつも全国範囲に亘って政治運動や社会的動乱が起こり,一見安定性がないように見えるが,その背後には,はっきりとした脈絡がほそぼそながら存在する. つまり,国家主権の確立及び国家工業化・近代化の実現に向けての努力である. この 2 つの目標に向けて,その時々の国際情勢と国内情勢に応じて,農村経済体制は変化してきたものと考えられる. 特に,農業社会である中国の経済発展の初期段階では, 3 つの基本的な制約条件が存在する. つまり,第 1 に,人口が多く耕地などの自然資源が相対的に希少で,労働集約的な農法でも農村には大量の余剰労働力が存在すること,第 2 に,農業生産力が低くて農業余剰が少なく,近代産業に投入しうる資本が不足すること,第 3 に,国土が広く地域間の生産力格差が大きいこと,である(馬洪, 1986, 3 頁). これらの条件が農村経済体制の変化とどのような関わりあいを持つか,農業生産力の発展との関連において,また統計資料の一層の吟味を基礎として考察することは今後に残された興味深い課題である...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural riverbanks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion, which led to disappearance of important river features for flora and fauna. River restoration projects show that the removal of man-made bank protections may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Van den Berghe et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2014). Habitat diversity in rivers may be enhanced through the formation of river bars with preferably diversity in bar height, size and location. This research aims at gaining knowledge into <b>the</b> effects of <b>removing</b> riverbank protections on bar formation to enhance habitat diversity. Mobile-bed flume experiments were performed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The experiments were focussed on bar formation related to three variables of a bank protection removal; length, location and flow asymmetry. Geometrical and morphodynamic characteristics were selected for the experiment having a bar mode of one to obtain a system with alternate bars (Crosato and Mosselman, 2009) and showed gravel-bed river similarity based on bankfull river characteristics of Parker (2004). The experimental flume consisted of a 6. 2 metre long and 0. 2 metre wide straight channel with 0. 5 metre wide floodplains on the sides. On both sides of <b>the</b> channel, bank <b>protection</b> could be removed over a limited length with optionally a groyne upstream. After seven hours {{at the end of each}} test, photos of the bed topography were taken and the longitudinal bed profile was measured. Bar wavelengths and bar heights in each experimental test were determined from detrended bed profiles. The bar height was divided in two classes: low and high. The areas of low bars, high bars, floodplains and the deep channel were determined from photos of the final bed topographies. Bar types were indicated with terminology from Duró et al. (2015) as forced, free or hybrid. Removal of bank protections resulted in lateral erosion of channel banks over a limited length. The eroded bank line moved in downstream direction, which agrees with the downstream meander migration observed in field and laboratory investigations by many authors (e. g. Odgaard, 1987). Scour holes developed downstream of the widened section, due to turbulent eddies forced by the channel geometry. In the widened reach, flow decelerated which resulted in a lower sediment transport. Consequently, sediment was deposited in the widened reach and caused rising of the mean bed level along with formation of bars. In areas with higher flow velocities an increased sediment transport deepened the channel. When the riverbanks were fixed, relatively low, small, side bars were formed in the channel. In general, the total bar area and bar height increased for an increase in channel widening, due to the removal of bank protection. An increased bank protection removal length up to nine times the channel width or an upstream asymmetrical flow forcing, i. e. groyne, increased the total bar area, whereas a bank protection removal at three different locations with a total length of nine times the channel width did not significantly increased the total bar area. It is recommended <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> riverbank protections over a length of at least nine times the river width on both sides of the river with optionally a groyne upstream as a measure to enhance habitat diversity. It is also valuable <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> bank <b>protection</b> on one side of the river only. It is advised to construct a groyne upstream of <b>the</b> bank <b>protection</b> removal to increase habitat diversity. This research led to results that can be used in further research. It is advised to conduct larger scale experiments and eventually move to the field. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|LSD helps create many landforms {{including}} barrier islands, bay {{beaches and}} spits. In general LSD action serves to straighten the coast because {{the creation of}} barriers cuts off bays from the sea while sediment usually builds up in bays because the waves there are weaker (due to wave refraction), while sediment is carried away from the exposed headlands. The lack of sediment on headlands <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> of waves from them and makes them more vulnerable to weathering while the gathering of sediment in bays (where longshore drift is unable <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> it) protects <b>the</b> bays from further erosion and makes them pleasant recreational beaches.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts, {{assessing}} marine and synthetic compounds active firstly against Plasmodium falciparum (Chapter 3 and 4) and secondly active against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, Chapter 5). In Chapter 3 the synthesis of nine new tricyclic podocarpanes (3. 203 - 3. 207 and 3. 209 - 3. 212) from the diterpene (+) -manool is described. Initial SAR study of synthetic podocarpanes concluded that the most active compound was a C- 13 phenyl substituted podocarpane (3. 204, IC₅₀ 6. 6 μM). By preparing analogues with varying halogenated substituents on the phenyl ring (3. 209 - 3. 212) the antiplasmodial activity was improved (IC₅₀ 1. 4 μM), while simultaneously decreasing the haemolysis previously reported for this class of compounds. Inspired by the antiplasmodial activity of Wright and Wattanapiromsakul’s tricycle marine isonitriles (2. 16 - 2. 21 and 2. 24 - 2. 27) an unsuccessfully attempt was made to convert tertiary alcohol moieties to isonitrile functionalities in compounds 3. 188, 3. 204 - 3. 207 and 3. 209 - 3. 212. Over a decade ago Wright et al. proposed a putative antiplasmodial mechanism of action for marine isonitriles (2. 4, 2. 9, 2. 15, 2. 19 and 2. 35) and isothiocyanate (2. 34) which involved interference in haem detoxification by P. falciparum thus inhibiting the growth of the parasite. In Chapter 4 we describe how we successfully managed to scale down Egan’s β-haematin inhibition assay for the analyses of small quantities of marine natural products as potential β-haematin inhibitors. Our modified assay revealed that the most active antiplasmodial marine isonitrile 2. 9 (IC₅₀ 13 nM) showed total β-haematin inhibition while 2. 15 (IC₅₀ 81 nM) and 2. 19 (IC₅₀ 31 nM) showed partial inhibition at three equivalents relative to haem. Using contempary molecular modelling techniques the charge on the isonitrile functionality was more accurately describe and the modified charge data sets was used to explore docking of marine isonitriles to haem using AutoDock. In Chapter 5 we describe how a lead South African marine bisindole MRSA pyruvate kinase inhibitor (5. 8) was discovered in collaboration with colleagues at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and how this discovery inspired us to design a synthetic route to the dibrominated bisindole, isobromotopsentin (5. 20) in an attempt to increase the bioactivity displayed by 5. 8. We devised a fast and high yielding synthetic route using microwave assited organic synthesis. We first tested this synthesis using simple aryl glyoxals (5. 27 - 5. 32) as precursors to synthesize biphenylimidazoles (5. 21 - 5. 26), which later allowed us to synthesize the ascidian natural product 5. 111. This method was sucessfully extended to the synthesis of deoxytopsentin (5. 33) from an N-Boc protected indole methyl ketone (5. 89). We subsequently were able <b>to</b> effectively <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> carbamate <b>protection</b> via thermal decomposition by heating the protected bisindole imidazole (5. 90) in a microwave reactor for 5 min under argon. The synthesis of 5. 20 resulted in an inseparable mixture of monoprotected and totally deprotected topsentin products, and due to time constraints {{we were not able to}} optimise this synthesis. Nonetheless our synthesis of the marine natural product 5. 33 which was faster and higher yielding than previously reported routes could be extended to the synthesis of other topsentin bisindoles (5. 138 - 5. 140). Work towards this goal continues in our laboratory. ...|$|R
