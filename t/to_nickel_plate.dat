50|$|NASA Engineers started {{development}} with a Woodway medical treadmill design {{which is available}} to anyone on Earth, and they asked Woodway <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plate</b> the parts and make some other modifications, but it is fundamentally the same running-in-place device as the commercially available model. The structures which support the treadmill are a different story. Without gravity to hold the runner {{to the surface of}} the treadmill, designers added elastic straps that fit around the shoulders and waist in order to keep the runner from rocketing across the space station with the first hard step. Designers also had to work out a way to keep the treadmill from shaking the whole station with every step. Preventing vibrations is relatively easy to do on Earth, but the station is floating just like the astronauts are, and it wants to react against any movement that is made inside of it. Even small actions can shake up delicate microgravity experiments taking place inside the station’s laboratories. Developing a system to stop the vibrations was the biggest challenge, Wiederhoeft said.|$|E

Should the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> Trail connect <b>to</b> Tipton, the trail would then be near 60 miles in length, meeting the same length of the Cardinal Greenway, the current longest rail trail in Indiana. It would also connect Tipton, Sharpsville, Oakford to Kokomo via {{an extension of the}} current Industrial Heritage Trail on the city's south side.|$|R

50|$|Some {{firearms}} incorporate {{stainless steel}} components {{as an alternative}} to blued or parkerized steel. Some handgun models, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 60 and the Colt M1911 pistol, can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plating.</b> Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.|$|R

50|$|The Galaxy IV was a {{telecommunications}} satellite that was disabled and lost due to short circuits caused by tin whiskers in 1998. It was initially thought that space weather {{contributed to the}} failure, but later {{it was discovered that}} a conformal coating had been mis-applied, allowing whiskers formed in the pure tin plating to find their way through a missing coating area, causing a failure of the main control computer. The manufacturer, Hughes, has moved <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plating,</b> rather than tin, {{to reduce the risk of}} whisker growth. The tradeoff has been an increase in weight, adding 100 to 200 pounds per payload.|$|R

50|$|Compared <b>to</b> cadmium <b>plating,</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> {{offers a}} shinier and harder finish, but lower {{corrosion}} resistance, lubricity, and malleability, {{resulting in a}} tendency to crack or flake if the piece is further processed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{unconfirmed}} {{number of}} 601s launched prior to August 1997 have a design flaw in their SCPs, where a tin-plated relay forms crystalline [...] "whiskers" [...] under certain specific conditions. These whiskers eventually caused an electrical short. Each satellite contains two SCPs and the backup unit will take {{control in the}} event of a failure of the primary unit. In some cases, both SCPs have failed, rendering the spacecraft unusable. A notable example was the Galaxy IV satellite. At least eight 601s have experienced SCP failures; four of which were double failures resulting in total loss of the satellite. Hughes switched <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> on later 601s to resolve this problem, at the expense of payload weight.|$|R
5000|$|The chinrest and {{shoulder}} rest accessories {{come in a}} great variety of styles and shapes, so each individual may find the combination that best suits their build and playing style. The search for the ideal combination can be a lengthy one in some cases. Whatever the equipment, the player will usually aim to maintain a balanced, natural, and comfortable attitude, with the spine straight, especially the neck. Many violinists have a reddish mark on the neck, the so-called [...] "violin hickey" [...] (or [...] "fiddler's hickey") from long-term pressure at that spot. The spot may be aggravated by an allergic reaction <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> on the chinrest clamp hardware, or by microbial pathogens present on the instrument.|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{composite}} coating of electrodeposited <b>nickel</b> and chromium <b>to</b> protect molybdenum from oxidation at elevated temperatures has certain prac-tical limitations. Examination of the composite coating showed that the prob-lems of blister formation, weakening of the bond between nickel and chro-mium, and edge separation were interrelated.

40|$|The {{results of}} the work {{presented}} here refer to a high temperature oxidation of TiAl alloys coated with a protective layer of nickel aluminide. The nickel aluminide layer was formed by the method of pack aluminization of nickel coating which is electrochemically positioned onto the alloys surface. Prior <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>plating,</b> TiAl alloys underwent the process of aluminization leading to the formation on their surface of a layer enriched with Al. It has been established that during the aluminization the electrochemical nickel layer transforms into a protective layer of nickel aluminide Ni 2 Al 3. The alloys Ti 48 Al 2 Cr 2 Nb and Ti 48 Al 7 Nb covered with the coating were exposed to oxidation in the air atmosphere at a temperature of 800 oC. The layer of NiAl is covered with the Al 2 O 3 scales during the oxidation. Inter-metallic phases containing Ni, Al, Ti, Nb are formed in the coating and in the near-surface alloy layer...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> leased the Wheeling and Lake Erie on December 1, 1949. In March 1950, the Pennroad {{announced}} plans to lease the P&WV <b>to</b> the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate.</b> In 1962, the Norfolk & Western Railway filed to include the P&WV in the upcoming merger of the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate.</b> On October 16, 1964, the Norfolk and Western acquired the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> and leased the P&WV. On the other hand, the Western Maryland Railway eventually went to the competing Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1967. Following the abandonment of the Western Maryland Railway mainline from Connellsville to Cumberland, Maryland, in 1975, a connection was established between the P&WV and the B&O at a location near Connellsville called Sodem, and the P&WV's connection to the P&LE and WM was abandoned at this same time. This enabled a semblance of the old Alphabet Route to continue under the Chessie System, although on B&O lines east from Connellsville instead of WM lines.|$|R

In 1954, Banks advanced the hypothesis that industrial premises had become safer places of work than the home where industrial products are used without guidance concerning their dangers. More-over, individual tradesmen and artisans, using certain potentially hazardous substances without safeguards, may be sensitized before entering employment in factories. Nickel dermatitis, a case in point, is found both in factory workers and in the general population.

40|$|Abstract:- Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> is {{a widely}} used plating method in many industries. The {{usability}} of the coating is, however, restricted by the control problems related <b>to</b> the electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> process. <b>To</b> ensure deposit quality, the transcendent properties of electroless nickel deposit should be accurately controlled during plating, which is challenging because of the spontaneous, unstable reaction and lack of online measurements. To improve operator based control, a special monitoring system for electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> is presented in this paper. The monitoring system is calibrated especially <b>to</b> the electroless <b>nickel</b> process used for Plated-Through-Hole (PTH) board manufacturing. In the paper it is shown, that, the system is capable to estimate the electrical, chemical and deposit parameters of the plating process from standard measurements of <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> industry. The proposed monitoring system enables also the replace of the individual parameter supervision by {{the supervision of the}} overall process dynamics, i. e. the electrochemical processes. Key-Words:- Monitoring, state estimation, electroless plating. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{functional}} integrity of liver among workers exposed <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> during nickel-plating process. The functional integrity of liver was assessed in 69 {{workers who are}} exposed <b>to</b> <b>nickel</b> during <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> and considered as nickel-exposed workers; and 50 administrative workers residing in same city, but away from the place of work of study group, were considered as control group. The level of urine nickel was measured by using a flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Using kits supplied by Bayer Diagnostics, we determined serum markers of liver function tests. Results: The levels of urine nickel were significantly increased in high-and moderate-exposure groups as compared to control group. The levels of serum transaminases -viz, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase-were significantly increased in nickel-exposed workers, who had high urine nickel levels as compared to control group. The level of serum albumin was negatively correlated with urine nickel levels. The levels of serum transaminases and serum g- glutamyl- transpeptidase were positively and significantly correlated with urine nickel levels. Conclusion: Results indicate that workers who had high urine nickel levels had a consistent effect on hepatic inflammatory function...|$|R

5000|$|A 2-3 µm {{layer of}} gold dissolves {{completely}} within one second during typical wave soldering conditions. [...] Layers of gold thinner than 0.5 µm (0.02 thou) also dissolve completely into the solder, exposing the underlying metal (usually <b>nickel)</b> <b>to</b> the solder.
