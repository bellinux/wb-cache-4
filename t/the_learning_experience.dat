25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E
25|$|According to this {{viewpoint}} instructors {{should see}} assessment {{as a continuous}} and interactive process that measures {{the achievement of the}} learner, the quality of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> and courseware. The feedback created by the assessment process serves as a direct foundation for further development.|$|E

The normative survey method of research was used. One hundred fifty-one interpersonal process recordings were analyzed by the content-analysis technique. Categories were established through a review of the literature. One hundred twenty-nine <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> were identified. Fifty-three per cent of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> were interact ions in which the nurse and/or patient expressed their expectations of the nurse, the patient, and the relationship. Only one per cent were interactions in which mutual goals were discussed. Fourteen per cent of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> were interactions where independent behavior was encouraged on the basis of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s dependent needs. Only three per cent of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> involved <b>the</b> nurse 2 ̆ 7 s and/or the patient 2 ̆ 7 s expression of feelings concerning the relationship.

25|$|There {{are also}} several {{business}} schools which still {{rely on the}} lecture method to give students a basic business education. Lectures are generally given from the professor's point of view, and rarely require interaction from the students unless notetaking is required. Lecture {{as a method of}} teaching in business schools has been criticized by experts for reducing the incentive and individualism in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> to where the learners want to create value.|$|E

In the 2011 rankings, UBC was ranked 2nd in the category: top 5 teaching programs. UBC's law school ranked fifth among Canadian law schools. The Sauder School of Business' MBA programs were ranked fourth in Canada. The same rankings placed the business school 11th in Canada for its undergraduate business program.|$|E
25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

500|$|Throughout the series, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship}} is problematic, as Homer often struggles to understand Lisa, who {{in many ways}} is a little girl but who is also smarter than him. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] in their book The Simpsons in the classroom: Embiggening <b>the</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Experience</b> with the Wisdom of Springfield. They wrote that in the episode, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship is}} badly damaged after Homer allows Lisa's room to {{be turned into a}} cell phone tower. When the two enter sensory-deprivation tanks, Lisa has several hallucinations, including one in which she becomes Homer. This experience shows Lisa how she appears from Homer's point of view, and makes her realize that her treatment of Homer is hurtful, as he often participates in activities with her that he does not enjoy. The episode ends with Homer and Lisa watching a demolition derby, which Lisa enjoys because she is spending time with Homer. The episode advises children to be accepting of their parents, who [...] "do the best [...] can" [...] to raise them.|$|E
500|$|... "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] {{was written}} by then-showrunner Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore, airing {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was Scully's first writing credit since he took over as showrunner for the show. In comparison with other episode scripts, the staff writers did not change much of the original writing. The plot revolves around Mel Gibson doing a remake of the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analysed the episode and wrote in the book The Simpsons in the Classroom: Embiggening <b>the</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Experience</b> with the Wisdom of Springfield that [...] "the episode is able to critique the practice of test screening, violence in film, and one of movies' favorite standards – the car chase", calling it [...] "a ridiculous parody of an action-film violence orgy". Staff writer Tom Gammill {{came up with the idea}} for the violent version of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Gibson throwing his Senator badge away at the end of the film, is a reference to the ending of the film Dirty Harry from 1971. The idea for the set piece with electric cars at the beginning of the episode came from Kevin Nealon, who was a friend of former showrunner David Mirkin. One day, he came by and demonstrated his electric car for the writing staff.|$|E

2500|$|It is [...] {{important}} for instructors {{to realize that}} although a curriculum may be set down for them, it inevitably becomes shaped by them into something personal that reflects their own belief systems, their thoughts and feelings about both {{the content of their}} instruction and their learners (Rhodes and Bellamy 1999). Thus, <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> becomes a shared enterprise. The emotions and life contexts of those involved in the learning process must therefore be considered {{as an integral part of}} learning. The goal of the learner is central in considering what is learned (Brown et al. 1989; Ackerman 1996).|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{concerns}} regarding the presence of corporations in the school.

[...] Other issues of corporate involvement in schools reveal disquieting implications of a corporate ideology and ethos entering <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> of our young people (Hill and McGowan, 1996). Teachers are concerned that partnerships with corporations involved in military research and development send a clear message to students. The presence of military contractors in classrooms suggests that schools are not concerned with violence and oppression in the world (Hill and McGowan, 1996).|$|E

40|$|Mobile <b>learning</b> has <b>the</b> {{pedagogical}} {{potential to}} provide informal, context-based educational experiences that can teach practical and applicable workplace skills and behaviors. The {{goal of this}} study was to examine <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> and outcomes of healthcare professionals as they participated in a mobile learning activity designed to teach them the technical and procedural skills for facilitating clinical consultations via videoconference. The primary research question was: How does the use of a curriculum framework to design mobile <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> impact <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> and outcomes of healthcare professionals with regards to developing workplace skills and understanding clinical processes? Informed by a systematic review of <b>the</b> mobile <b>learning</b> literature, this dissertation proposed a conceptual framework to guide the implementation and evaluation of mobile learning based on five dimensions of instructional design: content, structure, delivery, usability and communities of practice. Physicians, nurses and healthcare administrators voluntarily participated in this pragmatic, mixed methods study. Their quantitative and qualitative feedback was utilized both to assess the validity of <b>the</b> proposed mobile <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> conceptual framework as well as its quantitative and qualitative evaluation tools. The study found that informal, contextual mobile learning content can promote communication and collaboration among healthcare professionals, and provide them with hands-on <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> that can be easily situated in a specific workplace environment. Delivery was identified as perhaps the most critical element in increasing motivation and interactivity among participants, and communities of practice after <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> activity were found to increase collaboration and provide opportunities for problem-solving. The structure of embedding <b>the</b> informal mobile <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> within a formal, didactic online learning course was also found by participants to provide the right mix of background knowledge and practical application to produce meaningful <b>learning</b> outcomes. Overall, <b>the</b> mobile <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> conceptual framework synthesizes best practices in the literature and proposes innovative methods for the design and evaluation of effective mobile learning...|$|R

Data was gathered from each of the participants during the course by conducting interviews, exchanging email, and examining course assignments. The collected data was disaggregated by typological analysis and was reported in sequence from course start to finish to observe changes in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> and strategies of each participant as time in the course progressed. Each participant described many new <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> throughout <b>the</b> course. In addition, each participant described specific learning strategies that were used to resolve problems or to improve <b>the</b> online <b>learning</b> <b>experience.</b> Some of these learning strategies were common to traditional classroom courses, while others were newly invented and were specifically applicable to courses taught online. A cross case analysis revealed that although the two study participants shared many <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> in common, each also cited experiences that were unique to their particular situation. The participants also described several common learning strategies and others that were case specific. The separation in distance affected <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> of both first time online learners. Each participant also expressed feeling distant and disconnected from classmates and the instructor at various times throughout the course.
