5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of P.fluviatile is {{typically}} 10–12 years. Moulting {{does not occur}} in winter. Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August. Females carry the eggs on their pleopods (appendages on the abdomen) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs, having passed through the larval stages inside the egg.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The {{age of a}} few snails was {{estimated}} to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in mechanical damage to the snails.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMutations in RAS 2, CYR 1, and SCH 9 extend <b>the</b> chronological <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by {{activating}} stress-resistance transcription {{factors and}} mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod 2). Here {{we show that}} mutations in CYR 1 and SCH 9 also extend <b>the</b> replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of individual yeast mother cells. However, the triple deletion of stress-resistance genes MSN 2 /MSN 4 and RIM 15, which causes a major decrease in chronological <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> extends replicative <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Similarly, <b>the</b> overexpression of superoxide dismutases, which extends chronological survival, shortens <b>the</b> replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> and prevents budding in 30 – 40 % of virgin mother cells. These results suggest that stress-resistance transcription factors Msn 2 /Msn 4 negatively regulate budding and <b>the</b> replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in part by increasing SOD 2 expression. The role of superoxide dismutases and of other stress-resistance proteins in extending <b>the</b> chronological <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of yeast, worms, and flies indicates that the negative effect of Sod 2, Msn 2 /Msn 4 /Rim 15 on <b>the</b> replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of S. cerevisiae is independent of aging...|$|R

5|$|Torosaurus is a ceratopsid genus first {{identified}} {{from a pair}} of skulls in 1891, {{two years}} after the identification of Triceratops. The Torosaurus genus resembles Triceratops in geological age, distribution, anatomy and physical size and it has been recognised as a close relative.

Paleontologists investigating dinosaur ontogeny (growth and development of individuals over <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span)</b> in the Hell Creek Formation, Montana, US, have recently presented evidence that the two represent a single genus.|$|E
40|$|Cancers are {{different}} diseases that start and evolve each {{in its own}} manner, and trigger variable responses from the organism depending upon the neoplastic process under way and upon the physiopathology of the organism. The clinical incidence of the different cancers is spread through <b>the</b> human <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> with regional differences for each cancer; for many cancers the incidence is increasing at younger ages. More {{than half of the}} cancers become clinically manifest {{during the second half of}} <b>the</b> human <b>life</b> <b>span</b> and their frequency increases with age, but their natural history starts way back at earlier ages. The data suggest that the late manifestation is the result of the accumulation of events through time rather than of aging. Interestingly, late in <b>the</b> human <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>the</b> incidence of neoplastic disease declines. Is this due to the cohort of late survivals naturally resistant to the development of neoplastic processes, or to the characteristics of the last `window' of <b>the</b> human <b>life</b> <b>span?</b> <b>The</b> evolution of neoplastic disease is the result of pre- and postnatal aggressions suffered by the organism, individual susceptibility, and developmental changes that evolve continuously from the beginning to the end of <b>the</b> human <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> <b>The</b> identification of the causes of the incidences of the different cancers through <b>the</b> human <b>life</b> <b>span</b> will help to understand both neoplastic disease and aging of the organism...|$|R

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of right whales. One of the few {{well-documented}} cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{additional}} theory {{that explains the}} occurrence of the reminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series of culturally important transitional events {{that are expected to}} occur in a certain order at various points during <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> During early adulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing experiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are therefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially determined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life script typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur during early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually include includes positive experiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or buying a house. Events that deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These events, such as the death of a child, are not culturally expected and often do not show a peak of recall at any specific point during <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Life scripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the happiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump.

25|$|Mainly {{focusing}} {{on the development of}} the human mind through <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.|$|E
