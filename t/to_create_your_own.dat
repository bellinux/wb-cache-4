The General Manager is allowed to make staffing decisions, schedule workouts and events. This was also the last game in the Smackdown vs Raw series to have a General Manager mode.

5000|$|After Lupton {{graduated}} from college in 1985, her drive for changing the commercial art world took a change for the best. Lupton graduated {{with a degree in}} typography and later sought to follow within the field of design. “Graphic design was a revelation to me,” says Lupton. “Design really wasn't in the mainstream back then. It was esoteric. It was the thing you did if you were very 'neat,' which I wasn't.”. With the booming interest in self-help books, Lupton co wrote the book titled D.I.Y.: Design It Yourself with graduate students from MICA. This book showed ordinary people, a new way of designing their own, unique works. From designing blog pages <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> book cover, Lupton breaks down the simplicity of the design world.

50|$|The worst lot {{falls to}} spiritual culture: {{learning}} it {{is a long}} and dull process, so it is easier <b>to</b> start <b>creating</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> anew, rejecting the “obsolete”. Every new generation goes through this cycle: they create their own new works of art and behavior precedents. For instance, modernism negated preceding culture and claimed to start a “new era”. They create a new style. In this sense, every new style is, to a degree, demonstration of ignorance. Often new styles are based on inventions of a new technology or on an innovation in division of labor.|$|R
