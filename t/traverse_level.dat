40|$|Abstract — As the use {{of mobile}} robots expands to more diverse and {{challenging}} environments, improved mobility meth-ods are required to provide these platforms {{with the ability to}} reliably negotiate these terrains. In this paper, we investigate SCARAB, a quadrupedal platform designed to rapidly <b>traverse</b> <b>level,</b> vertical, and inclined surfaces. This study extends previous work in which SCARAB’s climbing performance was analyzed to demonstrate its ability to run effectively on level ground. We detail several modifications made to the platform to improve its capacity to both climb and run. This updated platform was used to investigate the influence of leg configuration and leg phasing on running performance and shows that SCARAB is able to run at speeds upward of 40 cms− 1. Furthermore, analysis of the dynamic characteristics shows similarity between those of the robot and the Lateral Leg Spring model, particularly for configurations that produce the highest running speeds. These results make SCARAB the first platform to effectively demonstrate horizontal plane dynamics quantitatively similar to this model, as well as the first to utilize two distinct dynamical locomotion modalities.

40|$|ION IN SYSTEMS Paul A. Fishwick and Kangsun Lee Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department University of Florida Gainesville, FL 32601 Abstract As complex {{models are}} used in practice, modelers require ways of {{abstracting}} their models and having the ability to <b>traverse</b> <b>levels</b> of abstraction. The use of abstraction in modeling is spread over many disciplines and {{it is often difficult}} to locate an abstraction methodology or a set of practical techniques to help the modeler to perform the abstraction. Several approaches have been discussed in the general simulation literature: (1) variable resolution modeling; (2) combined modeling; (3) multimodeling; and (4) metamodeling. Our premise is that there are two different approaches to abstraction: behavioral and structural. We present one physical example of heat transfer and display the different abstraction approaches on this example. The approach taken to abstraction is an important design approach [...] -to break a system into [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Stepping {{through the}} items of a tree, {{by means of}} the {{connections}} between parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.)A level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the entirety of a tree; nodes are <b>traversed</b> <b>level</b> by level, where the root node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until all nodes in the tree have been traversed.|$|R

5000|$|The player, as Kid Chameleon, {{progresses}} {{through a}} series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the [...] "main path" [...] (<b>traversing</b> <b>levels</b> only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called [...] "Elsewhere". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes.|$|R

50|$|Steg's {{offspring}} {{occupy a}} nest {{at the top}} of a cavern, and must be fed with maggots. If the slugs are not fed in time, they die and are replaced by tombstones. Once all the young slugs are fed, Steg proceeds to the next cavern where another nest of young wait to be fed. Maggots roam the game's caverns and must be captured in the bubbles which Steg can blow in order to transport them. In order to blow bubbles the player must press and hold the fire button, which fills a meter. Once the meter is full, Steg blows a bubble when the fire button is released. Above the bubble blowing meter on the game screen is an energy bar which drains once the bubble meter is filled. Steg must hold his breath until the maggot is close enough to capture. Once encapsulated, the maggot can be blown to the nest by Steg, which involves avoiding hazards which can burst the bubble or harm Steg. Other objects such as trampolines can aid the player in jumping higher. Steg is invulnerable to damage but can suffocate if his breath is held for too long. To <b>traverse</b> <b>levels</b> he is able to jump and adhere to walls and ceilings, crawling up and down to visit the nest and locate maggots.|$|R
5000|$|Survey Camp is an army {{tradition}} that was discontinued {{in the later}} part of twentieth century but was reinstated in 2002 across the universities {{of the world with}} a whole new structure. It is the civil engineering training course for two weeks usually after completion four semesters of bachelor of technology that consists of 8 days working in the field and 6 days of map preparation in the computer lab. Experts say that survey camp provides necessary foundation for civil engineers. Each day in the course there are at least 8 hours of working in the field. Students are divided into groups and they get out with practising surveyors and use their equipment out in the field. A camp incharge teacher appoints group leaders for each group; the leaders are responsible for all the works of his particular group and the equipment. In the computer lab, students learn applications such as AutoCAD and Carlson Survey. The students use these programs to take data collected from the field to develop topographic maps of the particular area. The basic aim of the survey camp is to know various works carried out in the industrial field by surveying, which includes determining the topography of particular area with the help of survey work, map study and reconnaissance work.
